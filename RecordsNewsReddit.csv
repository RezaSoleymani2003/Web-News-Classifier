A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and math performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading andmathperformance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.
Eighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.
The assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect adownward driftacross grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.
“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”
While the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19,school closuresand related issues such as heightenedabsenteeism. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.
The dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis onshort texts and book excerpts, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.
“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”
Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants togive states more controlof education spending.
“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.
House Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students. The declines show a need for federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity, said Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.
“Eliminating the very agency responsible for supporting public schools and enforcing civil rights protections of students will only deepen the achievement gaps identified by this assessment,” Scott said.
The test scores show more students are not reaching what would be considered “basic” achievement across subject areas, said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.
“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”
In reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.
In math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.
The high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.
The gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system. The achievement gap widened also in 12th grade math.
The scores also reflect the re-emergence of agender gapin science, technology, engineering and math courses. In 2019, boys and girls scored virtually the same on the NAEP science assessment. But in 2024, girls saw a steeper decline in scores. A similar pattern occurred in state math assessments, according to an Associated Press analysis.
Schools had largely closed the gender gap in math and science, but it widened in the years following the pandemic as special programs to engage girls lapsed.
On a NAEP survey of students, a shrinking percentage of eighth grade students said they regularly took part in inquiry-based learning activities in the classroom. The pandemic disrupted schools’ ability to create those hands-on learning experiences for students, which are often critical to understanding scientific concepts and processes, said Christine Cunningham, senior vice president of STEM learning at the Museum of Science in Boston.
Still, she noted declines across subjects began well before schools closed in 2020.
“We don’t know exactly what the cause of it is, but it would be incomplete to assume that if we hadn’t had COVID, the score would not have gone down,” Cunningham said. “That’s not what the data showed even before the pandemic.” ___

After U.S. President Donald Trump imposedtariffs on Canadian goodsin early March, a number of provinces retaliated, pulling American alcohol from store shelves.AlbertaandSaskatchewanhave since lifted the ban.
During a conference call with investors Thursday, officials with Brown-Forman — the parent company of brands such as Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve — noted other pressures, but said the boycott is being felt.
""While we were encouraged by recent discussions, American spirits products have been off the shelf in Canada for months,"" said Leanne Cunningham, the chief financial officer for Brown-Forman. ""This had a significant impact on our first quarter of fiscal 2026, which will impact our full fiscal year results.""
It's unclear how much the 62 per cent drop in sales translates to in dollars, but the company's total sales were down three per cent for the quarter.
On the call, company chief executive officer Lawson Whiting said the trade dispute has created ""significant headwinds.""
""While our non-U.S. brands such as Diplomatico and El Jimador continued to deliver growth, they were not able to offset the decline of our brands that are produced in the U.S.,"" he said.
The Canadian boycott was not brought up much during the conference call. CBC News listened to the conference call, but was not called upon to ask a question.
Apress release issued by the companysaid net sales in developed international markets dropped eight per cent because of ""macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.""
U.S. liquor producers caught in trade war want tariffs gone
""The decline was led by lower volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in Germany and the United Kingdom, along with the absence of American-made alcohol from retail shelves in most of the Canadian provinces,"" it said.
The decrease was largest in Canada, as the U.K. only saw a 16 per cent decrease. It was 10 per cent in Germany.
Last week, Prime Minister Mark Carney announcedCanada was removing retaliatory tariffs on CUSMA-compliant U.S. goods, which included 25 per cent on American spirits.
In 2024, Canada was the second-largest market for U.S. spirit exports, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States.
It welcomed Carney's decision to drop the tariffs, but with a caveat.
""This is a very positive sign, but until all provinces put American spirits back on their shelves it won't have much of an impact,""the organization said in a press release this week.
""The unfortunate decision to remove American spirits from Canadian retail shelves is not only harming U.S. distillers, but it's also needlessly reducing revenues for the provinces, and placing unnecessary burdens on Canadian consumers and hospitality businesses.""
The decision to ban American alcohol has meant most Canadian retailers are stockpiling American alcohol.
In Nova Scotia, that's worked out to587,153 unitsof product that was property of the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation — the province's Crown-run alcohol agency.

In Forrest Gump, thetitle character, played by Tom Hanks, receives the Congressional Medal of Honor from President Lyndon B Johnson.
In real life, it appears Hanks will no longer receive another military honor.
The alumni association of the US Military Academy, or West Point, announced in May that it would award Hanks, a two-time Oscar winner, with its 2025 Sylvanus Thayer award, which is given to an “outstanding citizen of the United States whose service and accomplishments in the national interest exemplify personal devotion to the ideals expressed in West Point’s motto: ‘Duty, Honor, Country’”.
Now, the West Point Association of Graduates has canceled the ceremony to honor the actor just weeks before it was to take place, theWashington Postreported.
In an email to faculty, retired Col Mark Bieger stated that the decision would allow the academy to “continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army”.
In addition to his storied acting career, Hanks served as national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial in Washington DC and supported the late Republican senator Bob Dole’s fundraiser to create the Dwight D Eisenhower Memorial, according to the alumni association’soriginal announcement.
It’s not clear how honoring Hanks conflicts with “preparing cadets”, but the actor has donated to Democrats; received thePresidential Medal of Freedomfrom Barack Obama; and endorsed Joe Biden in the 2020presidential election.
Since taking office a second time, Donald Trump has taken a litany of actions against hisperceived enemies. For example, he has revoked the security clearances and details of some people in theBiden administrationand of peoplewho servedin hisfirst administrationwhom he deemed “bad” or “disloyal”; blocked somenews organizationsfrom the Pentagon workspace and White House press pool; and revoked security clearances of – and investigated –law firmsthat were “very, very dishonest”.

A rare total lunar eclipse “blood moon” will be visible from the UK on Sunday night for the first time since 2022.
The moon is expected to turn a deep, dark red as the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface.
According to the Met Office, the moon will take on a reddish hue because it will be illuminated by light that has passed through the Earth’s atmosphere and has been bent back towards the moon by refraction, scattering blue light and allowing red wavelengths to reach the moon.
Where skies are clear, the eclipse will be visible at about 7.30pm on Sunday. The Met Office recommends people keen to see the phenomenon plan to be somewhere with as clear a view of the eastern horizon as possible, ready for the lunar eclipse to peak in the UK at 7.33pm. In built-up areas this may mean going to a hill or viewpoint.
The eclipse – sometimes referred to as a “blood moon” – will be visible to the naked eye and unlike solar eclipses is safe to view directly as the moon’s reflected light is not as bright.
Dr Ed Bloomer, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, said the moon will rise over the UK just in time for people to see the tail end of the eclipse. He said: “The moon is pretty unmistakable in the sky, so the most important thing is to face the right direction.
“It’ll be rising towards the east, and head southwards over the course of the night. As it rises, the most important thing will be whatever is low on your horizon. A flat landscape, or an elevated position makes for the best visibility – so there aren’t things like buildings, trees, or other things in the way.
“A lunar eclipse like this is a great opportunity for observing with kids too. It isn’t too late for us in the UK, the target is nice and easy, and minute by minute you will notice changes – good for short attention spans.”
People eager to see the eclipse are advised to check the forecast in their area over the weekend, but the Met Office said the clearest skies for viewing the blood moon are most likely to be across the south-west and parts of eastern England.
The Royal Observatory said the next partial lunar eclipse will be in August 2026. Other regions well positioned to view the eclipse include Australia, China, India, the Philippines and parts of Africa.
But most of North and South America will miss out entirely as they will be on the sunlit side of the planet during the event.Throughout history, blood moons have stirred awe and superstition. Ancient cultures from Norse to South American, Native American to Chinese, interpreted the red moon as a sign of divine anger or supernatural conflict, while biblical texts warned that “the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the day of the Lord comes, that great and terrible day”."
reddit,r/news/,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/california-wildfires-chinese-camp,t3_1n7ps3n,Fast-moving wildfire destroys multiple structures in historic California Gold Rush town,Face2FaceRecs,2025-09-03 20:20:07,783,11,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Blaze in Chinese Camp – a town settled around 1850 by Chinese miners – was caused by lightning, authorities say
Multiple structures have burned in a historic Gold Rush town in northernCaliforniaafter thousands of lightning strikes ignited a spate of fast-moving fires in the rural dry foothills of the eastern Sierra.
Chinese Camp, about 57 miles (92km) east of Stockton and named for the Chinese miners who settled there, is a registered California landmark filled with historic structures, and home to roughly 60 residents.
Officials have not yet released details on the scale of the damage, but footage from the fire line showedbuildingsleveled and engulfed in flames, as firefighters battled through the night.
It was not yet clear whether the town’s handful of Gold Rush-era structures – including an old post office built in 1854 – had been damaged. A shuttered Catholic church dating back to 1855 appeared to have survived the flames. The town’s general store where tourists could pick up supplies and see historic artefacts also seemed to be intact. But on some lots, all that remained were charred brick walls and scorched trees.
The complex of lightning-sparked conflagrations broke out on Tuesday. By Thursday morning, the so-called TCU September Lightning Complex hadspread across more than 13,700 acres, with 15% containment. The wildfire was on of more than a dozen conflagrations burning across the state.
“You can see the scale of destruction from this fire,” the local news KCRA reporter Peyton Headlee said in a social media video as she walked down the main road of Chinese Camp,now laden with smoldering rubble on all sides. The blaze had already jumped Highway 120 and Highway 49, she said.
“When a historic building burns, it’s a piece of history we lose,” Stephen Provost, who wrote the book Chinese Camp: The Haunting History of California’s Forgotten Boomtown,toldthe San Francisco Chronicle. “When a whole town like that goes – I mean, wow … I just can’t. It’s just devastating.”
California’s governor,Gavin Newsom, secured a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) to support fire-suppression efforts, his office announced on Tuesday, and pre-deployed firefighting resources tofive counties across the northern part of the state facing elevated risks.
“We are securing all available resources – including support from our federal partners – to fight this growing lightning complex fire in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties,” Newsom said in a statement.
Along with the eight blazes that are considered part of the TCU September Lightning Complex,dozens of other fires are burning in the state, with months left before the high-risk conditions begin to subside.
The fires are spread across the region about 120 miles east of San Francisco. There have been no reports of injuries, but several structures were destroyed in two of the fires, said Emily Kilgore, a spokesperson for the California department of forestry and fire protection (Cal Fire), the state’s chief fire agency. Damage assessments have not been completed.
Many of the fires are in remote and rugged areas, some with very difficult access, Kilgore said.
“There still may be fires that haven’t been discovered yet,” Kilgore said, warning that more evacuations may be necessary.
Temperatures were expected to be in the 90s during the next few days with little rain in sight. Strong winds added to the challenge as flames strengthened in areas filled with dry, tall grass and brush, according to Cal Fire.
The largest of the fires crossed 10 sq miles (26 sq km) around Chinese Camp, where at least five homes burned. During the first hours, residents moved tree branches and shoveled sand on to flames in a desperate attempt to stop them from spreading until firefighters arrived. A recreational vehicle on a property was damaged.
Chinese Camp, now a pass-through for tourists traveling to Yosemite, flourished in the 1850s as a stagecoach stop and supply hub for mining camps during the Gold Rush.
Thousands of Chinese immigrants came to California during the Gold Rush and faced persecution that included an exorbitant foreign miners tax designed to drive them away from mining.
The town grew as Chinese miners who were driven out of a nearby camp arrived, according to Visit Tuolumne County. Originally called Camp Washington, its name was soon changed to reflect the thousands of people from China who settled there.
It has already been a devastating year of fire in California, starting with the firestorm that swept into communities across Los Angeles in January, killing 31 people. Overall, there have been more than 6,500 wildfires in the state in 2025, collectively burning close to half a million acres.
Significant fire potentialis forecast to be above normal in Septemberacross northern California, according to an analysis from the National Interagency Fire Center issued on Monday, and high risks are likely to linger into October.

BALTIMORE — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whoreunited with his familylast week after 160 days apart following his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, was taken into ICE custody Monday after an immigration check-in, but a judge later ruled that he cannot be deported, for now.
The check-in with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore was part of the conditions of his release Friday from federal custody.
While such meetings are usually routine and meant for case updates, Abrego's attorneys had expected he would be taken into ICE custody after the Trump administration over the weekend announced itsintention to deport him to Uganda.
""There was no need to take him into ICE detention. ... The only reason they took him into detention was to punish him"" for exercising his constitutional right to speak up and fight proceedings, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego's attorneys.
Monday afternoon, Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego was being held at a detention center in Virginia.
Abrego was deported in March but returned to the United States on June 6, after he wasindicted and chargedwith transporting within the United States people who were not legally in the country. He has denied the allegations.
Abrego filed a new lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Maryland ""seeking to ensure that he is not removed from the United States pending his immigration proceedings.""
The lawsuit asked a federal judge to issue an order that Abrego not be allowed to be removed from the United States unless he is given proper due process to fight his potential deportation.
The suit challenges Abrego's deportation to Uganda or any other country unless and until he has had a fair trial, Sandoval-Moshenberg said. He later argued that deporting his client to any country without any credible assurances that he could stay there would be “just a very inconvenient layover to El Salvador.”
At a hearing Monday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered that Abrego must remain stay detained in the United States — temporarily blocking his deportation to Uganda — until she holds an evidentiary hearing.
Xinis said there are ""several grounds"" on which there may be jurisdiction for her to exercise relief — among them that Uganda has not agreed to offer Abrego protections, like being able to walk freely, being given refugee status and not being re-deported to El Salvador.
Before his ICE check-in appointment and detainment Monday morning, Abrego addressed reporters surrounded by family, supporters, faith leaders and his legal team, who were all calling for his freedom.
""My name is Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and I want you to remember this, remember that I am free and I was able to be reunited with my family,"" he said in Spanish before a translator repeated in English.
""This was a miracle. Thank you to God and thank you to the community,"" he added. ""I want to thank each and every one of you who marched. Lift your voices, never stop praying and continue to fight in my name.""
The government says Abrego was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March,in violation of a 2019 court order. After much legal resistance, he wasreturned to the United States in June and hit with human smuggling chargesout of Tennessee, which he pleaded not guilty to.
The Trump administration has repeatedly accused Abrego of being a member of the notorious MS-13 gang, which his attorneys have denied. His lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the United States when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.
The Trump administration offered Abrego a plea deal last week, his lawyers said in a court filing Saturday that was part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider ""vindictive"" and ""selective"" prosecution.
If he pleads guilty to the federal charges out of Tennessee and serves time, he can be deported to Costa Rica. The Costa Rican government said he would live as a free man there, according to the filing.
Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego would not accept the plea deal, as he ""will not accept charges of which he's not guilty.""
But Sandoval-Moshenberg said that if Abrego is deported to Costa Rica instead of Uganda, that would be ""a perfectly reasonable option.""
""Even if they were to name Spain as the country — unless they've got guarantees he can stay that country, all it is is really a way station on the way right back to El Salvador, where it's already been established that he can't go,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday on ""Meet the Press NOW.""
""And that's what we have from Costa Rica right now: assurances of refugee status, assurances that they will not re-deport him,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said.
While the Abrego case has received a lot of attention, there have been others who have allegedly been deported erroneously, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.
He said he has gotten emails from more than a dozen other immigration lawyers saying the same thing happened to their clients.
“This whole business with third-country removals is really brand new; it’s just something that started,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.
“We thought that Abrego Garcia was sort of a one-of-a-kind case,” he said. “But it turned out really to just be the tip of the spear.”

Longtime customers told Eyewitness News they were shocked by what they saw.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted a morning raid at the business, taking several workers into custody in front of stunned customers.
ICE was apparently following up on a promise to ramp up immigration sweeps across Southern California. In addition to the car wash, agents were also seen at a Home Depot in Pomona on Friday.
""They literally just stole somebody!"" a witness said in one of the videos of the incident.
""People are screaming at the ICE people, cursing at them and yelling at them,"" said witness Jay Schwartz. ""They're wearing masks. They're wearing bulletproof vests. They have their long guns. They have their pistols, and they're chasing and yelling at everybody.""
Studio City Hand Car Wash is well-known in the community. It has been in business on Ventura Boulevard for more than 30 years.
Several workers were chased down, taken into custody and loaded into vehicles by masked agents during Friday's operation.
Owner Ben Forat said he was shocked by the raid.
""Hard-working guys that worked here for a few years, some of them,"" Forat said. "" Always show up to work. They don't drink, they don't do drugs, they don't steal. They're good guys. It's a sad day.""
According to the Department of Homeland Security, four people from Guatemala and Mexico were arrested during the Studio City Operation.
Federal agents also conducted an enforcement operation at a Home Depot in Pomona.
""U.S. Border Patrol conducted a targeted immigration enforcement operation at Home Depot in Pomona, California, that resulted in the arrest of three illegal aliens from Guatemala and Mexico,"" DHS said in a statement. ""Misael Feliciano-Lopez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was previously convicted of felony inflicting corporal injury on a spouse and arrested for DUI.""
The Pomona Home Depot has been raided by ICE multiple times. SoCal car washes have also been frequent targets.
Democratic State Senator Susan Rubio condemned the operations.
""I am devastated that four Home Depot day laborers were taken this morning in Pomona. These are hardworking people, simply seeking the opportunity to provide for their families. Raids like this do nothing but terrorize communities and punish those who contribute to our economy. Families are being destroyed in the process, and children are left alone, crying and wondering if they'll ever see their parents again,"" Rubio wrote in a statement. ""As a Senator, I will continue to fight to ensure that all families are treated with dignity and respect. This must stop."""

(WECT) - The Wilmington Police Department (WPD) answered questions and clarified information about the recent arrest of a man who allegedly drugged the ice cream of two teens.
James Yokeley Jr. allegedly put pills containing narcotics in his 16-year-old step-granddaughter’s and her 15-year-old friend’s Dairy Queen blizzards.
Yokeley is the former Chair of the Surry County Board of Elections, but also has a residence in New Hanover County.
According to WPD, on Aug. 3, the two teens discovered the pills in their ice cream while in the car with Yokeley. The teen who was driving pulled into a Sheetz parking lot, where they located paramedics.
The paramedics checked the girls before flagging down police in the area.
“I believe the young ladies who were involved in this case, when they discovered the pills, they became very concerned and emotional,” said Lt. Greg Willett of WPD.
During an investigation into the incident, WPD says they found security footage allegedly showing Yokeley putting the pills into the ice cream himself. WPD says the footage will not be released at this time.
“There was obviously an effort made by Yokeley to conceal his behavior,” said Willett.
The Wilmington Police have officially ruled out all Dairy Queen employees and stated that the store was vital to helping move the case forward.
“I mean, this is a case where video surveillance played a tremendous role and everything has worked out the way it needed to,” said Willett.
At this time, the type of drugs the pills contained has not been confirmed. WPD says the field test showed compounds of MDMA and Cocaine, but a lab test is being done, and other drugs could be identified. There is no timeline for when the results will be available.
Yokeley was arrested on Aug. 26 and posted bond on the same day, according to the WPD.
“We are eager for this case to be concluded so that the victims can receive justice and closure,” said Rodney Dawson, Captain of the WPD.
The press conference was held at WPD Headquarters on Aug. 29.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/15/us/new-zealand-mother-detained-us-hnk-dst,t3_1mr8qcq,A New Zealand mother and her 6-year-old son made a brief trip to Canada. They have spent weeks detained by ICE.,AnonRetro,2025-08-15 20:05:01,26076,1165,N/A,N/A,N/A,"A Washington state mother and her 6-year-old son have been released after spending more than three weeks in US immigration detention due to a brief trip to Canada and a small paperwork mistake, her attorney told CNN on Saturday.
Sarah Shaw, a New Zealand citizen who has lived legally in the US since she arrived in 2021, was detained at the Blaine, Washington, Customs and Border Protection checkpoint when returning home after dropping her two oldest children off at the Vancouver airport for a flight to visit their grandparents in New Zealand.
Shaw, 33, chose the flight out of Vancouver because it was direct and she didn’t want her children to have to navigate a layover alone, her attorney Minda Thorward, told CNN.
But Shaw didn’t realize the travel permit that allowed her to exit and re-enter the US had expired. That’s when Shaw and her son, whose immigration documents were valid, were taken into custody by CBP.
Judge pauses expedited deportations of migrants granted humanitarian parole
Shaw tried to get ahumanitarian parole, which would have allowed her to enter the US and return home, but she was denied, her attorney said.
Shaw then asked if her boyfriend or a friend could pick up her son since his documents were up to date, but she was again denied, Thorward said.
They were transported to the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, roughly 2,000 miles from their home.
Shaw’s detention is among the latest examples of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, which, despite pledges to focus on violent criminals, has also swept up lawful residents like Shaw.
Shaw arrived in the US as a tourist in 2021 and married a citizen that year. Shortly after, the marriage ended, and she filed an I-360 petition in April 2022, her lawyer told CNN. Her application remains under review after multiple delays.
Shaw had been living in the US under a “combo card,” a dual document that serves as both a work permit and travel document. She secured the permit through her job working for Washington state, her lawyer said.
When it came time to renew both parts of the combo card, Shaw paid to have the work permit renewed, but didn’t renew the travel permit “because she didn’t have any plans for travel at that time and it’s expensive,” Thorward said.
‘They’ve never been afraid before’: Why some green card holders’ concerns are growing
In June, Shaw received confirmation of her work permit renewal, but mistakenly believed it also extended her travel authorization – a “minor administrative paperwork error” – according to her lawyer.
“She had completely re-established herself. She had a full-time job, an apartment, adopted a dog, a new boyfriend, and the kids were in school and doing great,” Thorward said. “She made a mistake, but she has no previous convictions – none. This is a very clean case.”
Shaw previously told Thorward the Department of Homeland Security said she may be released on Friday, but Thorward said she hadn’t received any direct updates from authorities. CNN has reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement regarding Shaw’s case.
New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry said it was in contact with Shaw but declined to provide further details for privacy reasons.
Set to begin a master’s program in psychology this month at Northwest University, Shaw was worried about whether she would be released from detention in time, her lawyer said.
Americans largely oppose Trump’s ramp-up of deportations, CNN poll finds
Thorward said border officials had the discretion to grant Shaw humanitarian parole rather than detaining her.
“It was not necessary, inappropriate and inhumane (to detain Shaw and her son),” Thorward said. “She’s lawfully in the country. She’s been doing everything in good faith.”
In a statement to CNN, a CBP spokesperson said that individuals with expired parole trying to re-enter the US would be detained in compliance with immigration laws.
“If they are accompanied by a minor, CBP will follow all protocols to keep families together or arrange care with a legal guardian,” a spokesperson said.
A friend of Shaw’s, Victoria Besancon, told CNN Shaw has spent three weeks in a cramped detention facility, feeling “incredibly isolated.”
“Each room contains 5 to 6 bunk beds, and rooms are locked from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.,” Besancon told CNN, adding that she has been able to phone Shaw daily and recently video chat.
Besancon said they were among the few English speakers in the facility.
Shaw’s son has been “very sad he lost his summer vacation to being locked in the facility.” Shaw has used commissary funds to buy him ice cream and colored pencils to make him feel at home.
“There’s not a lot for kids to do. Maybe some coloring books. There’s no time for them to be outside,” Thorward said, adding detainees were left sweltering in the South Texas heat, where summer temperatures can reach up to 97 degrees.
3 children who are US citizens — including one with cancer — deported with their mothers
The South Texas Family Residential Center, one of the largest of its kind in the US, primarily houses migrant women and children. Afterclosing last year,it reopened in March under an agreement betweena private prison operatorand ICE, with a capacity to detain up to 2,400 people.
Other mothers who have beendetained with their childrenat family migrant facilities have similarly described their experiences as traumatic and said they will have lasting psychological effect on children.
ICE says the detention centers are safe. On its website, the agency includes a list of safety and health standards for family residential centers.
The Dilley facility is “retrofitted for families,” an ICE spokesperson said. “This includes medical, dental, and mental health intake screening” and access to medical care.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/27/fda-covid-vaccine-authorization--rfk.html,t3_1n1p32b,FDA approves new Covid shots with limits on who can get them under RFK Jr.,RdRaiderATX84,2025-08-27 18:30:31,4994,635,N/A,N/A,N/A,"The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved the latest round of Covid vaccines in the U.S., butset new limitson who can get them.
The agency ended its broader authorization of the shots, only clearing them for people at higher risk of severe illness. That includes those 65 and up and younger adults with at least one underlying condition that puts them at higher risk.
The move could complicate access to the shots for millions of Americans, and raises questions about whether insurance plans will still cover them for healthy adults.
""The emergency use authorizations for Covid vaccines, once used to justify broad mandates on the general public during the Biden administration, are now rescinded,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in aposton X.
""The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense,"" he said. ""This framework delivers all three.""
It follows several efforts by Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, to change immunizations in the U.S. The new limited authorizations are a break from U.S. vaccine policy in previous years, which recommended an annual Covid shot for all Americans 6 months and up.
Akey panel of vaccine advisorsto the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must vote to recommend the Covid shots. But Kennedy earlier this yeargutted that paneland named new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics.
In the post, Kennedy said the shots are available for all patients who choose them after consulting with their doctors. But it's unclear how easily patients without high-risk factors will be able to get a Covid vaccine.
Kennedy said the FDA has authorizedModerna's shot for those 6 months and up,Pfizer's vaccine for people ages 5 and up, andNovavax's jab for those ages 12 and up, but only for those specifically at higher risk of getting severely sick from the virus.
Adults ages 65 and up are at higher risk of severe Covid, and so are younger adults who are immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and heart diseases, according to theCDC's website.
The end of the so-called emergency use authorizations means that Pfizer's shot is no longer cleared for children ages 6 months to 4 years. It comes after Pfizer in August said it has requested that the FDA keep that authorization in place for the upcoming fall and winter season.
In a release, Pfizer confirmed that the FDA hadcleared its updated Covid shotfor use in adults 65 and above and those ages five through 64 with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe illness. The company will begin shipping the shot immediately, and it will be available in pharmacies, hospitals and clinics nationwide ""in the coming days.""
In a separate release, Moderna also confirmed that its updated Covid shot is approved for those 65 and up and people 6 months through 64 years of age who are at higher risk of severe illness. The company added that its new, next-generation Covid vaccine is approved for older adults and high-risk patients ages 12 through 64. Moderna said it expects the shots to be available in the coming days.
Shares of Pfizer and Moderna were trading slightly higher Wednesday afternoon, while Novavax shares dipped.
In May, the CDC dropped therecommendationthat pregnant women and healthy children receive Covid shots. But the American Academy of Pediatricsdivergedfrom the agency earlier this month, recommending Covid shots for children between 6 months and 2 years old.
In a statement on Wednesday, Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, called the FDA's more limited approval ""deeply troubling."" She said respiratory illnesses like Covid can be ""especially risky for infants and toddlers, whose airways and lungs are small and still developing.""
""Any parent who wants their child vaccinated should have access to this vaccine,"" she said. ""Today's unprecedented action from HHS not only prevents this option for many families, but adds further confusion and stress for parents trying to make the best choices for their children.""
She said the AAP urges the administration to ""allow these choices to remain with medical experts and families.""
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists alsoadvisedpregnant women to get the Covid vaccine to protect themselves and their infants, who cannot be immunized until they are 6 months old.

Donald Trumpimposed 50% tariffs on most US imports from India, making good on a threat to punish one of the world’s largest economies over its purchases of discounted Russian oil.
The tariffs, which came into effect just after midnight on Wednesday in Washington, risk inflicting significant damage on the Indian economy and further disrupting global supply chains.
US tariffs of 25% on Indian goods went into force earlier this month, but Trumpannounced plans to double the rate, citing New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, which the White House has argued are indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine.
The US president has significantly increased US tariffs on goods from much of the world since re-entering the White House in January, straining relations with economies of allies and rivals and fueling fears of higher inflation.
This latest move leaves Indian exporters facing among the highest US duties Trump has slapped on goods from overseas. Brazil is also grappling with 50% tariffs on its exports to the US.
Ministers in India argue the country has been unjustly singled out for its trade relationship withRussiaand officials caution the country will likely work more closely with Moscow and Beijing – and drift further from Washington – as a result.
Most Indian exports to the US (worth $87.3bn to the US last year, according to the US trade representative) now face steep duties, although some key products including smartphones are set to be spared, for now.
The action, confirmed in a notice by the US Department of Homeland Security earlier this week, prompted some economists to predict a precipitous fall in trade between the two countries.
“I don’t care what India does with Russia,” Trump claimed on Truth Social, his social network, last month. “They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
In India,the mood has been defiant. The country’s government has refused to halt purchases of Russian oil, andNarendra Modiurged Indians to buy local.
“All of us should follow the mantra of buying only ‘made in India’ goods,” the prime minister said on Tuesday, encouraging shopkeepers to display big signs promoting domestic products. “Pressure on us may increase [from the tariffs], but we will bear it,” he added.
Goldman Sachs’s chief India economist, Santanu Sengupta, warned that sustained 50% levies could push gross domestic product (GDP) growth below 6%, from a forecast level of around 6.5%. Rival exporters from Turkey to Thailand, facing lower US tariffs, are already scooping up American buyers with offers of cheaper goods.
About 30% of India’s exports to the US – including pharmaceuticals, electronics, raw drug materials and refined fuels – worth $27.6bn, remain duty-free. But sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, and seafood, long reliant on the American market, face shrinking order books. “At a 50% tariff, it is very difficult to export,” Sengupta said.
The effects are already visible. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) reported textile and apparel manufacturers in Tirupur, Delhi and Surat had already halted production due to “worsening cost competitiveness”.
“Indian goods have been rendered uncompetitive compared to competitors from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines and other south-east and south Asian countries,” said FIEO president SC Ralhan.
Indian shares tumbled before the tariffs, with the benchmark BSE Sensex dropping 1%, or 849 points, to 80,876 in Mumbai on Tuesday.
The US, India’s largest export market, accounts for nearly a third of shipments in key sectors such as gems and jewellery and textiles, highlighting the potential economic impact.
Even if the tariff row eases,trust in future relations with Washingtonis probably the biggest casualty.
“Trump has blown it. The hard work between the two countries, which inherently did not trust each other but still managed to build a solid strategic relationship, is now at risk,” said a senior Indian trade official, who requested anonymity. “It is going to take a long time to reboot, and it probably won’t happen until Trump is out.”
“At a working level, the countries must cooperate, but politically, neither can afford to appear weak,” the official added.
S Jaishankar, the external affairs minister, called Washington’s demand that New Delhi stop buying Russian crude “unjustified and unreasonable” and accused the west of hypocrisy, noting that Europe trades far more with Russia. To avoid the extra US tariff, India would have to replace about 42% of its oil imports.
While Trump has accused India of indirectly funding Russia’s war against Ukraine through its purchases of Kremlin crude, he has not taken similar action against China, another major purchaser.
He has also sought to diffuse tensions with Moscow,inviting Vladimir Putin to Alaskafor a summit earlier this month andeven mooting a trilateral meetingwith Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of efforts to end Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Despite tensions, Jaishankar said, US-India trade talks continue. “We are two big countries, we need to have conversations … the lines are not cut,” he said.
Earlier hopes for a trade deal capping tariffs at 15% were dashed after India refused to open its agriculture market to US farm goods for fear of harming the country’s poor farmers.
India has pivoted toward Russia, which it calls an “all-weather friend”, and Jaishankar travelled to Moscow recently to meet the Russian president, who is expected to visit New Delhi later this year. Modi will also make his first trip to China in seven years to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, aiming to stabilise relations after a deadly 2020 Himalayan clash put ties into a deep freeze.
“India will tiptoe toward China, but not in a full embrace. There is a trust factor from the past with China, and much history to reconcile, but the reality is that India must do business with China,” said another senior Indian official, who also asked not to be named.
“The current [Trump] administration may set a record for the highest number of own goals with a top bilateral partner over such a short period of time,” said veteran South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman."

The husband of a candidate for Congress in Washington, who is also a veteran, was taken into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on Thursday.
Melissa Chaudhry is running for Congress in Washington’s 9th District and is married to Pakistani native Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry. The couple thought Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry was taking a step toward citizenship when he arrived for an interview at an immigration office in Tukwila. Instead, he was detained by ICE.
“We saw faithlessness and we saw betrayal, when we came in good faith, with open hands and put ourselves into their power,” Melissa Chaudhry told KIRO Newsradio. “And now my family is torn in pieces, and my soul is shredded, and I have to explain this to our two little children who don’t know what happened to their Baba.”
Melissa Chaudhry said her husband is a disabled U.S. military veteran who has lived in the country for 25 years.
“They waited an hour before they told us, according to what I spoke with him when he was in the detention center, and they have given us no explanation as to why,” Melissa Chaudhry said.
Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry was allegedly involved in two incidents where he made misrepresentations to government officials after he came to America in 2000,The Olympianreported.
Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry was a taxi driver in Australia in 1996 when one of his customers didn’t have money for their fare and left their passport as a promise to return with cash. Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry allegedly used the passport to try to open a bank account and obtain medical benefits, according to court records obtained byThe Olympian.
Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry also used a credit card that wasn’t his, Australian police reported.
Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry was subsequently criminally convicted, but did not mention it in his 2001 visa application, according toThe Olympian. Melissa Chaudhry said the conviction was the equivalent of a parking ticket.
“It’s far beyond the look back period for good moral character, and when it comes to naturalization, especially for veterans,” she said.
She had no comment on the claim that he lied on a U.S. visa application in 2001.
Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry also allegedly misrepresented his citizenship in an application to become a reserve officer at the Yakima Police Department. He did serve in the National Guard.
“This should have resulted in him being finally granted the naturalization he earned as a disabled, decorated, honorably discharged American veteran from 20 years ago, but ICE had other plans,” Melissa Chaudhry said.
She doesn’t know what will happen next.
“I don’t know right now when, if ever, I will see my husband again, or on what continents or in what decade, everything is a possibility right now,” Melissa Chaudhry shared.
She said she plans to file what she can so that ICE will tell her why her husband was detained and secure his release.
The couple has a two-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old son.

U.S. stocks tumbled Tuesday as investors digested new economic data as well as Friday's ruling that most of President Donald Trump'ssweeping country-specific tariffs are illegal.
The Nasdaq composite closed 0.8% lower, and the S&P 500 dropped 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 249 points.
SeveralWall Street analystsraised concerns Tuesday morning about the potential that more than $120 billion in tariff revenue received so far this year might need to be paid back. Trump’s tariffs will remain in effect for now as the legal process plays out and a lower court reconsiders the case.
U.S. Treasury yields, already elevated by broader investor worries about debt levels and economies elsewhere, especially Europe, spiked to as high as 4.97% for a 30-year U.S. government bond and 4.30% for the 10-year Treasury.
The higher that Treasury yields move, the more it costs the government to borrow money. Under a scenario where tariff revenue needs to be refunded to consumers and companies, the U.S. may need to issue more Treasuries at those higher yields to pay for the refunds.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Mondaythat the administration expected the Supreme Court to uphold Trump's tariffs but was also preparing other ways to deploy country-specific rates.
On Tuesday, Trump said he would be holding an ""emergency meeting"" Wednesday at the White House to discuss appealing the ruling.
""We are so strong now and we are so respected and ... the stock market is down today because of the possibility"" that tariffs could be permanently blocked, Trump told Salem Radio.
""If we win this, the stock market is going to go right through the roof,"" the president added.
That scenario could also further stress the country's financial situation and $37 trillion in debt.
September is already typically the worst month for stocks, which have recently hit record highs. The renewed tariff uncertainty also comes alongside fresh data showing that the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for a sixth straight month.
In its survey, the Institute for Supply Management noted comments from a trucking industry respondent that said the industry ""continues to contract"" and is ""much worse than the Great Recession of 2008-2009.""
A food and beverage industry company told ISM that ""everything ... is about to get significantly more expensive"" due to high tariffs such as the 50% applied to Brazilian goods.
""Tariffs continue to wreak havoc on planning/scheduling activities,"" a computer industry company said.
Major companies are also sounding the alarm about consumers.
Speaking on CNBC, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said Tuesday that the fast-food giant has observed ""a two-tier economy"" recently with lower- and middle-income consumers ""feeling under a lot of pressure right now.""

Wednesday 3 September 2025 13:54, UK
An 80-year-old woman in Japan sent money to an online fraudster who told her he was an astronaut stranded on a spaceship - and needed the cash to buy oxygen.
The pair first met on social media in July in what police described as a romance scam.
The scammer told the victim, who lives in Japan's northern Hokkaido island, he was an astronaut and they continued to develop their online relationship.
The fraudster eventually told her he was ""in space on a spaceship right now"" and was ""under attack and in need of oxygen"".
Police in Hokkaido said the victim, who lives alone, was then persuaded to transfer around one million yen (£5,000).
Officers believe the exchange was part of a romance scam, when fraudsters take advantage of people seeking love.
They warned people should be suspicious if asked for money from someone they met online.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.dw.com/en/el-salvador-schools-enforce-military-style-haircut-checks/a-73740667,t3_1my2xad,El Salvador schools enforce military-style haircut checks,FLTA,2025-08-23 14:28:37,604,136,N/A,N/A,N/A,"El Salvador's students now face daily checks for short haircuts and neat uniforms — as well as weekly ""Civic Monday"" drills. The inspections were mandated by the country’s new minister of education, a military captain.
Public schools acrossEl Salvadorhave started enforcing strict new discipline rules that mandate military-style haircuts, perfect uniforms, and respectful greetings for teachers.
Some teachers' unions have lamented the measures as marking the militarization of education, but the government ofPresident Nayib Bukeledefends them as essential to restoring order in classrooms.
Students in El Salvador's public schools must adhere to strict disciplinary rules starting this week based on an order from new Education Minister Karla Trigueros, a high-ranking military officer.
The minister's memorandum states that, beginning August 20, principals ""must greet students daily"" at the entrance gates of the country's more than 5,100 public schools.
It also indicates that principals must ensure that students attend classes in ""clean and tidy uniforms,"" ​​with ""appropriate haircuts,"" and that they enter ""in an orderly manner with respectful greetings."" For boys, the rules require hair to be closely cropped.
""Failure to comply with these provisions by principals will be considered a serious breach of administrative responsibility,"" the minister warned.
Within the framework of strengthening discipline, order, and the personal presentation of the student community,"" the new minister told school principals in a memorandum published on the social network X, ""strict compliance"" must be given to disciplinary rules.
Meanwhile, students are required to approach the entrance in an orderly fashion, greet their teachers respectfully, and maintain a posture of discipline as they enter.
The rules on appearance already existed, but weren't enforced. The order caused lines to form in barbershops across the country and many students posted videos of themselves being shorn.
A later memorandum posted by Trigueros required all schools in El Salvador to stage weekly ""Civic Mondays"" throughout the school year to strengthen national identity, civic values, and discipline. The half-hour events were to include the entrance and removal of the national flag, singing of the anthem, a prayer to the flag, and a student presentation on a historical figure or event.
Officials said each school would receive $300 (€255) to cover expenses such as flags, gloves for flag bearers, and other related needs.
Trigueros, a doctor and army captain, was appointed minister of education byPresident Bukeleon August 14. She published the memorandum on August 20.
Trigueros, who often appears in a camouflage uniform, has said the rules are part of a ""strengthening of discipline."" Bukele echoed her stance on social media, writing that transforming schools was necessary to build ""the El Salvador we dream of.""
One of El Salvador's main teachers' unions stated that Trigueros' appointment will lead to a ""regrettable militarization"" of education.
The Salvadoran Teachers' Front, in a statement last week, said her appointment was ""absurd"" and harkened back to the country's decades under military dictatorship.
""We are concerned that the already exorbitant abuses of power against students will increase,"" or that ""workplace abuses against teachers will increase even further,"" the union said in a statement.
Another union voiced support for the government's order but called for changes to laws protecting children that it says hinder discipline.
""Many teachers, in a desire to achieve order and discipline in schools, were reported and many were punished,"" said Paz Zetino Gutiérrez, secretary of the El Salvador Public School Teachers Union.
Bukele, who took office in 2019 and wasreelected in 2024, is popular for his ""war"" on gangs, which reduced criminal violence to historic lows. Many Salvadoran schools previously suffered harassment from these gangs.

Ukraine has hit a key pumping station on the Druzhba oil pipeline bringing fuel to Europe from Russia, knocking out supplies to Hungary andSlovakia, the only remaining EU member states still receiving Russian oil.
AsUkrainetargets infrastructure crucial to Moscow’s war effort in response to the Russian onslaught, the commander of Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces, Robert Brovdi, announced the attack on the Unecha pumping station in the Bryansk region.
Bryansk’s premier, Alexander Bogomaz, said in a Telegram post that Ukraine firedHimars rocketsand drones at the region in a combined attack.
The Hungarian and Slovakian governments wrote to the European Commission, the EU executive, saying that Russian oil supplies could be suspended for at least five days owing to the damage.
“The physical and geographical reality is that without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not possible,” their foreign ministers, Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár, said in a letter.
The Ukrainian strike drew an angry reaction from Budapest, which gets more than half its crude oil from the Druzhba pipeline. Szijjártó wrote on Facebook it had been attacked “for the third time in a short time”.
“This is another attack on the energy security of our country. Another attempt to drag us into war,” he said.
Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has refused to join EU partners in backing Kyiv with political, economic and military support. Orbán visited Moscow last year for talks with the country’s president,Vladimir Putin, on a rare trip to Russia by a European leader.
On Friday, Orbán’s Fidesz party posted a note from its leader condemning Ukrainian strikes on the pipeline earlier in the week “just before thehistoric meeting between President Trump and Putin in Alaska”.
“Hungary supports Ukraine with electricity and petrol, in return they bomb pipeline that supply us,” Orbán wrote in English. “Very unfriendly move! We wish President Trump every success in his pursuit for peace!”
Below the text was a handwritten messageapparently written and signed by Trump: “Viktor – I do not like hearing this – I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia,” it read. “You are my great friend – Donald.”
While the other 25 EU member stateshalted Russian oil purchases as part of the bloc’s sanctionsafter Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Hungary and Slovakia have remained outliers.
The EU aims to phase out Russian oil and gas entirely by the end of 2027 but Budapest and Bratislava oppose such a move, arguing that Russian energy supplies are vital to their national economies.
Despite a push by Trump to reach a deal to end the conflict, the three-and-a-half-year war continued unabated this week as Russia launched an air attack near Ukraine’s border with the EU on Thursday and continued itsdevastating assault on Ukrainian cities.
Ukraine has repeatedly pounded Russian oil refineries among other targets, sending Russian wholesale petrol prices soaring to record highs in recent days. Moscow routinely targets Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, crucial for winter heating and as fuel for essential industries.
The Druzhba pipeline begins in Russia and transports oil through Belarus and Ukraine to Slovakia and Hungary. It was the second time that supplies to the EU countries were interrupted this week.
The Soviet-era pipeline, which runs through Belarus and Ukraine, also ships oil from Kazakhstan to Germany but its economy ministry said supplies of Kazakh oil were unaffected by the latest strike.
Slovakia’s Moscow-friendly prime minister,Robert Fico, has adopted Kremlin lines and sided with Orbán as a pro-Russian voice in the EU.
In May,Fico shook hands with Putin at the Kremlinbefore becoming the only EU leader to attend Russia’s 9 May parade of military forces waging war on Ukraine.

The group Queers for Palestine — Ottawa (Q4P) halted the parade ""with the permission"" of the grand marshal, the organization said in a press release issued Sunday afternoon just as the parade was stopped.
""This is what a village looks like!"" protesters chanted from Parliament Hill, referencing the ""We are a village"" theme that Capital Pride was using for 2025.
Q4P issued several demands for the organizers, Capital Pride, including that the group hold a ""boycott, divestment and sanctions"" town hall and commit to anongoing cultural and academic boycott of Israel.
They also demanded Mayor Mark Sutcliffe and other elected officials apologize for the 2024 boycott of Capital Pride and called on them to ""stand with us and all oppressed peoples, including Palestinians.""
""We are in the parade today to affirm very clearly that our Pride is not for sale, and that 2SLGBTQIA+ communities will not accept sponsors and elected officials dictating what we stand for, how we celebrate ourselves, and how we claim our space,"" the press release said.
Capital Pride announced the parade had been cancelled just before 3 p.m.on Instagram.
They also said Capital Pride did not have time for an interview but posted a statement on Instagram shortly after 6 p.m.
Capital Pride said Q4P was marching as a guest invited by the parade grand marshal and had met with festival organizers throughout the summer.
But on the day of the parade, Q4P ""refused to have a meaningful discussion about how to move forward,"" Capital Pride said, adding that street closures were only permitted until 4 p.m.
""After over an hour of attempting to resolve the stoppage, it became clear that Q4P was unwilling to engage in a good faith conversation and was insistent on misrepresenting our discussions,"" the statement read.
""The decision to cancel was not taken lightly, and we understand and appreciate the impact it had on our community — including over 7,000 people from more than 175 groups who showed up to march today.""
Sutcliffe also declined interviews Sunday but issued a statement that said, in part, that it was ""deeply regrettable that a group of activists chose to block the parade, ultimately leading Capital Pride officials to cancel the event.""
""My heart goes out to the many people in our city who were deprived of the opportunity to participate in this celebration of joy, resilience, and community,"" Sutcliffe said.
In 2024, Capital Pride issued a letter which condemned both ""the acts of terrorism"" committed on Oct. 7 and Israel's ""endless and brutal campaign in Gaza,"" which it said had caused the deaths of ""innocent Palestinians.""
The Jewish Federation of Ottawa called the statement ""antisemitic"" and said it would boycott the Pride parade in response.
Other groups and individualswithdrew their support and sponsorshipfrom some Pride Month events, including Sutcliffe.
The parade went aheadregardless, but this year the statement was removed from Capital Pride's website.
Capital Pride executive director Callie Metler told CBC last week that the removal was part of a website update but that it still stood by its ""principles and values.""
However, the organization has faceda campaign by Q4P to restore the statement and recommit to supporting Palestinians.
This year's parade route was slated to head up Elgin Street, past Parliament Hill on Wellington Street, before ending on Kent Street, not far from the street festival on Bank Street.
The usual length of the parade route washalved in 2024because there were not enough police officers to cover the full route.
This year's route was slated to be roughly the same length as the shortened route from last year, though it would have travelled along different roads.
Capital Pride told CBC in an email that they'd been ""trying to get a route in front of Parliament Hill for a few years"" and could not until this year, but did not say why the planned route was shorter than parades held before 2024.
Despite the parade's cancellation, the festival on Bank Street was still slated to continue. Sunday marked the final day of the nine-day event, held in August to commemoratea landmark 1971 rallyon Parliament Hill.

PUEBLO COUNTY, Colo. (KRDO) -- In a bizarre turn of events,13 Investigateshas uncovered that the Pueblo County Coroner is accused of hiding bodies in a secret room of his privately-owned funeral home, Davis Mortuary.
According to records by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA), Brian Cotter's funeral home was due for an inspection on Wednesday. When inspectors arrived, they noted ""a strong odor of decomposition.""
Later, inspectors said they noticed a door was hidden by a cardboard display. When they went to remove the display, inspectors say Cotter asked them not to go inside, according to DORA's records.
Inspectors did not follow Cotter's request; when they entered, they said they found bodies in various stages of decomposition.
""Mr. Cotter stated that the bodies were awaiting cremation and admitted that some bodies had been in the room for approximately fifteen years,"" suspension records say.
Additionally, Cotter allegedly told inspectors that he ""may"" have given family members of the deceased fake cremated remains.
Inspectors allege that Cotter failed to take action to embalm, refrigerate, cremate, bury, or entomb human remains within 24 hours.
According to the lead agency, the Colorado Bureau of Investigations (CBI), officials have set up a victim assistance line/tip line, which families can reach at (719)257-3359. Families also email the CBI at CBITIPS@state.co.us.
According to suspension records, Davis Mortuary is ordered to cease operations, pending proceedings.
According to Pueblo County, Brian Cotter has over 20 years of experience working with the Pueblo County Coroner's Office. He was first elected in 2014, with his current term slated to sunset in 2027.
Davis Mortuary is a privately owned funeral home with Cotter listed as the appointed designee, according to DORA records.
The funeral home has been in operation for over 100 years and was purchased by Brian and Chris Cotter back in 1989,according to their website.
""The Cotter brothers brought with them to the Davis Mortuary the 'old school' ways of caring for families in need, which they learned from their father, who owned and operated several funeral homes in Kansas, Nebraska, and Southern Colorado,"" reads the website.
Those living in Southern Colorado are likely to notice similarities between these allegations and those in a separate case out of Penrose, Colorado.
There, funeral home owners Carie and Jon Hallford were accused of allowing close to 200 bodies to stack up at their funeral home, Return to Nature.

A German court has ruled that a Nazi concentration camp memorial has the right to refuse entry to those wearing thePalestinian keffiyeh scarf.
The higher administrative court in the eastern state of Thuringia on Wednesday rejected a request from a woman to be allowed entry to theBuchenwald concentration campmemorial while wearing a keffiyeh.
According to local media reports, the woman was turned away when she attempted to attend a commemorative event marking the 80th anniversary of the camp’s liberation in April while wearing the scarf.
She then petitioned the courts to allow her to return to the memorial for another commemorative event this week while wearing a keffiyeh.
The court found that the memorial was within its rights to deny her entry, pointing to the woman’s declared aim of “sending a political message against what she saw as the [memorial’s] one-sided support for the policies of the Israeli government”.
“It is unquestionable that this would endanger the sense of security of many Jews, especially at this site,” the court said.
The court said the woman’s right to freedom of expression was outweighed in this case by the memorial’s “interest in upholding the purpose of the institution”.
Germany, still trying to atone for the murder of 6 million Jews in theHolocaust, has been one of Israel’s staunchest allies.

However, in recent months it has sharpened its criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza, with the chancellor, Friedrich Merz, announcing this month that no more licences would be grantedfor arms exports to Israel that could be used in Gaza.
The Buchenwald memorial faced criticism last month when an internal document was leaked that described the keffiyeh as “closely associated with efforts to destroy the state of Israel”.
The director of the memorial, Jens-Christian Wagner, said subsequently that the document contained “mistakes” and would have to be reworked. On the question of the keffiyeh, he told the NDR broadcaster last month that it was not per se “a forbidden symbol” at the memorial.
“However, when it is used together with other symbols … to relativise Nazi crimes, then we would ask people to remove those symbols,” he said.
About 340,000 prisoners, including Jews, Roma, homosexuals and Soviet prisoners of war, passed through Buchenwald and its annexe Mittelbau-Dora, both located near the German city of Weimar.
About 56,000 people lost their lives at Buchenwald – some executed, others starved or worked to death – and a further 20,000 died in Mittelbau-Dora, where inmates worked on the Nazis’ V1 and V2 rockets."

Doctors at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would be barred from performingabortions, even in cases of rape and incest, under newrules proposedby theTrump administration.
The draft regulations, which also forbid providers from counseling female veterans about terminating a pregnancy, have generatednearly 20,000 commentsin the federal register from conservative activists, abortion rights supporters and female veterans, many of them survivors of sexual assault.
“I am a veteran, a mother, and my abortion saved my life,”wroteMary Dodson-Otten, a 41-year-old nurse and air force veteran who lives outside Atlanta, Georgia.
Dodson-Otten told the Guardian she ended a pregnancy in her 20s after she got pregnant by an abusive boyfriend who was a fellow service member. Without the abortion, she said, “I don’t think I would have survived, whether it would have been him hurting me or me hurting me.”
The rule proposed by theTrump administrationhas an exception that allows abortions to take place “when a physician certifies that the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. But abortion rights advocates said the exception was too limited.
“Women are going to die,” predicted Caitlin Russell, a former US army captain who served two tours in Afghanistan and studies female veterans’ health at the University of Pennsylvania.
She said the exception would force “a woman to lie in the hospital bed until that woman is on death’s door” and cited high-profile cases of womendyingafter being denied miscarriage care in states that have strict abortion bans.
Sexual assault remains endemic in the military. About one in three women and one in 50 men respond “yes” when asked by their VA provider if they had been forced to endure sexual activity against their will while in uniform. Separate anonymous surveys have put the figure as high astwo in three femaleveterans.
VA researchers have alsofoundone in three female veterans experience intimate partner violence, a rate far higher than women who never served in the military.
Rita Graham, a former US army artillery officer and research director of theService Women’s Action Network(SWAN), said the rules were “unsafe and cruel and strip our military community of their right to make their own healthcare decisions.
“We fought for our freedoms and deserve the healthcare that comes with that,” she said.
The availability of abortions is relatively new at VA. The agency has only provided them under limited circumstances since 2022, following a policy change implemented by the Biden administration after the supreme court ended the federal right to abortion in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health.
In an emailed response to questions, the VA press secretary, Peter Kasperowicz, described the Biden administration’s policy as “politically motivated” and said it violated a1992 lawthat forbade the agency from providing abortions “except for such care relating to a pregnancy that is complicated or in which the risks of complication are increased by a service-connected condition”.
Legal experts say that law has been superseded. They note it also bans the VA from providinginfertilityandpregnancy care, which the agency continues to offer.
The VA also characterized the change as a matter of patient safety, claiming the “infrequency” with which the VA has performed the procedure since the 2022 policy was enacted had “raised safety concerns”.
According to the agency, veterans and their beneficiaries have received only 140 abortions per year under the policy through the VA.
Trump’s VA secretary, Doug Collins, is a staunch abortion opponent.
As a congressman, he received anA+ ratingfrom Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America andreferredto the 1973 supreme court decision that established the right to abortion as “barely coherent”.
Women are the fastest-growing group of military veterans, with a significant proportion of female veterans of reproductive age living in Florida, Georgia and Texas – states with near total abortion bans.
The comment period for the proposed rulesrunsthrough 3 September. Democrats on Capitol Hill haveproposed legislationthat would overrule the regulations should they go into effect and establish the legal right for veterans and eligible dependents to receive abortion care, medication and counseling through the VA as a matter of law.
The bill has little chance of passage given Republican control of Congress, however.
When the VA introduced the proposed rule on 4 August, Republicans on the House veterans affairs committee, led by its chairman, Mike Bost of Illinois, released ajoint statementpraising the decision.
“It’s simple,” they said. “Taxpayers do not want their hard-earned money spent on paying for abortions – and VA’s sole focus should always be providing service-connected health care and benefits to the veterans they serve.”"

ACalifornia woman known as the “Ketamine Queen”has agreed to plead guilty to federal drug charges in connection withMatthew Perry’s fatal overdose two years ago.
Jasveen Sangha, 42, will plead guilty to one count of maintaining a drug-involved premises, three counts of distribution of ketamine and one count of distribution of ketamine resulting in death or serious bodily injury, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.
Sangha faces a maximum sentence of 65 years in prison, the prosecutor's office said in a news release.
Sangha is expected to enter the plea in the coming weeks, according to the release. Her sentencing date has not been set.
""She's taking responsibility for her actions,"" her attorney, Mark Geragos, said after the prosecutor's office announced the agreement.
Several other people,including two doctors and Perry’s live-in personal assistant, pleaded guilty to ketamine distribution charges in Perry’s death.
Perry, 54, was found face down in the heated end of his pool in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles on Oct. 28, 2023.
The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner’s Office attributed his death to an accidental overdose of ketamine, a hallucinogen long known as a party drug that has grown in popularity in recent years as an off-label treatment for depression.
Perry openly discussed his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, and he had been undergoing ketamine infusion therapy to treat depression and anxiety. But federal prosecutors said he had sought — and received — unsupervised doses and developed an “out of control” dependence on the drug.
The medical examiner's office said the amount of ketamine found in his body was equivalent to the amount used in general anesthesia.
Sangha worked with an acquaintance of Perry’s, Erik Fleming, to ply Perry with the drug, according to the release, which cites the plea agreement.
In the weeks before his overdose, Sangha and Fleming, who also pleaded guilty to drug charges in connection with Perry's death, sold Perry 51 vials of ketamine, the release says.
The assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, then injected Perry with the drug. The prosecutor's office said he was responsible for administering the three injections that killed Perry.
""I’m 90% sure everyone is protected,"" Fleming wrote in a text message to Sangha after Perry's death, according to the release. ""I never dealt with [Perry]. Only his Assistant. So the Assistant was the enabler. Also they are doing a 3 month tox screening . . . Does K stay in your system or is it immediately flushed out[?].”
According to the release, Sangha admitted selling four vials of ketamine to another man, Cory McLaury, in August 2019. McLaury died from a drug overdose hours later.

Jordan and Israel have suffered through their hottest nights on record, with nocturnal temperatures in the Levant well above levels that scientists consider “hellish”.
Temperatures on Monday night did not go below 35C (95F) in Ghor es-Safi and Aqaba in Jordan, while in the capital, Amman, they stayed above 31.8C.
InIsrael, meteorologists reported a record-breaking nighttime minimum on Tuesday night of 36C in Sedom.
“It’s like you’re walking in a sauna,” said Fayha al-Shibli, a climate scientist at the University of Jordan, who lives in Amman.
Doctors fret about hot nights because they compound the damage done by heatwaves, preventing worn-out bodies from resting after the stress of a scorching day and contributing to a vast but overlooked death toll.
In many European countries, tropical nights refer to temperature minimums above 20C, while in Spain, which is more familiar with extreme heat, meteorologists describe nights above 25C as equatorial or torrid.
In recent years, they have begun to informally refer to those above 30C as “hellish”. Overnight temperatures in parts of Jordan and Israel this week remained a full 5C hotter.
Shibli said 2025 had already broken records for nighttime heat intensity in many parts of the country, though not for length or the number of events.
The climate scientist added that she and her children were suffering, but that she “thanked God” for technology such as air conditioning, which she has in her home, office and car.
“The people that can’t handle it are the people without air conditioning, and those who work on the street, like cleaners and builders,” she said.
Daytime temperatures also reached deadly peaks, with highs of close to 50C in Israel and thePalestinian territories. The Israel Meteorological Service said the highest temperature recorded on Wednesday was 49.7C in Gilgal kibbutz, a settlement in the occupied West Bank, setting a historical record in the Jordan Valley.
Aqaba, a port on the Red Sea, broke Jordan’s national heat record with a daytime maximum of 49.6C.
Temperatures in Gaza were cooler but still soared above 40C. Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinians, said on Thursday the heat was “making an already desperate situation far worse” by increasing dehydration. It added that limited electricity and fuel – amid bombardments and forced displacement – meant there was no relief from the heat.

Health ministries across the Middle East issued warnings to stay in the shade and drink water.
“Extreme temperatures – well above 40C during the day and above 30C by night – aren’t unknown in the region, but this is certainly unusual,” said Nick Lee, an assistant forecast manager at MetDesk.
He added that some of the locations experiencing extreme heat were at low altitudes – such as Ghor es-Safi on the shores of the Dead Sea, which is 350m below mean sea level – and that this contributed to the high values recorded.
“The same way that temperature typically decreases as you go higher, when you get to these extreme low altitudes you can see much higher temperatures than at sea level,” he said.
Heatwaves have grown hotter, longer and more common as fossil fuel pollution has trapped sunlight and baked the planet.
Shibli said heatwaves can be more dangerous if they are much hotter than what people have recently experienced.
“[People] can adapt to gradual changes, but can be caught off-guard by a sudden jump.”"

A giant data center proposed for Dale Earnhardt's family property has drawn fierce opposition from residents of Mooresville.
Far from the roaring speedways, NASCAR legend Dale Earnhardtwas an outdoorsmanwho liked to hunt and fish. There was plenty of space to do both on his sprawling land near Mooresville, North Carolina, a quiet town 30 miles north of Charlotte.
Now that land is at the center of a battle over the future of Mooresville that has galvanized residents and pitted Earnhardt’s widow, who wants to develop the property into an enormous data center, against one of Earnhardt’s children, who has joined the fight to stop her.
The proposed $30 billion Mooresville Technology Park would stretch across 400 undeveloped acres, adding several new buildings and an electrical substation. Teresa Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt’s widow, is seeking approval from the Mooresville Board of Commissioners to rezone his onetime sanctuary as industrial land. Tract, a Denver-based company that builds data centers and leases them to technology companies, has proposed constructing a new campus on that site.
Kerry Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt’s eldest son, is part of a growing group of residents urging the board to vote “no.”
“My Dad would be livid for his name to be associated” with the project, Kerry Earnhardtposted on Facebooklast week, ahead of a community meeting that drew hundreds of people. “Infrastructures like this don’t belong in neighborhoods where people’s natural resources will be depleted, wildlife will be uprooted, and the landscape and lives of the people that call this area home will forever be changed.”
Teresa Earnhardt, Dale Earnhardt’s third wife, who was married to him from 1982 until his death in a racing crash in 2001, did not respond to requests for comment. This is not her first dispute over Earnhardt’s legacy: A decade ago, she sued Kerry Earnhardt, her stepson, after he started an “Earnhardt Collection” home and furniture line, saying he was violating her trademark rights in their shared famous last name; ultimately, Kerry Earnhardt prevailed.
The Mooresville Board of Commissioners is scheduled to vote on the rezoning after a public hearing in September, but on Friday afternoon Mayor Chris Carney cast doubt on the project's future.
Carney, who previously told NBC News he was uncertain on the venture,posted a video on Facebooksaying he doesn’t feel able to vote “yes” because Tract hasn’t yet said which tech company would ultimately use the data center. And he suggested other board members shared his concerns.
“No matter what, you can only trust if you know who your final partner is going to be, and we just don’t know that,” said the mayor, who would only cast a vote if there's a tie among the board's six members.
Tract declined to comment to NBC News. A Tract spokesperson said in a statement toThe Charlotte ObserverFriday that the company was ""both disappointed and surprised"" and that it was ""carefully evaluating our next steps.""
Representatives for Tract haveglowingly pitched the project to residents, saying the center will be “a good neighbor” while generating hundreds of millions of dollars for the local government.
Earnhardt family disputes aside, the fight in Mooresville echoes similar debates across the country as communities grapple with the potential economic benefits and environmental downsides of giant data centers that are swallowing land and resources to feed America’s insatiable demand for computing power.
Crowds of people have packed meetings from Arizona to Alabama to express fears that these projects could overtax the electric grid, pollute the water and air, and generally disrupt their rural peace with hulking structures emitting a high-tech hum. Supporters, who often include local officials and business development groups, pitch the data centers as a way to infuse economic opportunity and tax revenue into struggling areas and make good use of land that would otherwise sit vacant.
The White House is also praising the projects amid the country’s artificial intelligence race against China. In July, President Donald Trumpsigned an executive orderto fast-track federal permitting for data centers.
There are alreadymore than 5,400 data centersacross the U.S., with many more on the way. The consulting company McKinsey said in April that itforecasts roughly $7 trillion in global spending on data centersin the next five years, sparked in large part by demand for processing power to meet the needs of tech companies racing to build and develop advanced artificial intelligence systems.
Data centers, often massive buildings dedicated to housing computing and data storage capacity, can strain local power andwater resources. A study by theEnvironmental and Energy Study Institutefound that large data centers can consume up to 5 million gallons of water per day.
While tech companies’ need for data centers is only growing, opponents of these projects have begun making headway in stopping them. In Arizona, the Tucson City Council on Wednesdayvoted againstAmazon’s Project Blue data center, worried that it would raise utility costs. In Oldham County, Kentucky, a data center developer pulled out of a project last month and the county’s fiscal court passed a moratorium on data centers after community pushback over environmental concerns.
Data Center Watch, a group funded by AI firm 10a Labs that tracks local opposition, found in May that$64 billion in data center developmentsin the U.S. had been blocked or delayed in the previous year.
“The volume, speed, and effectiveness of local opposition are reshaping the landscape of political risks for the data center industry,” Data Center Watch said in a statement to NBC News.
Wendy Reigel, an activist in Chesterton, Indiana,routinely gives advice to other communitiesfighting data centers after she started a successful movement against a $1.3 billion project in her town last year. She tells those who ask for her help that developers often present the centers as a done deal, but that isn’t the case.
“In the end, people need hope,” she said, “and then they need information, and then they got to work their rear ends off.”
That’s what the organizers in Mooresville have been doing. About 200 people crowded a Board of Commissioners meeting last Monday, many wearing red T-shirts to signal their opposition to the project. All 10 people who spoke at the meeting raised concerns, questioning Tract’s promises about jobs and worrying about the center’s demand for water in a drought-prone region.
“Does a data center belong in the middle of a thriving rural residential community?” Kerry Pennell, who lives near the proposed site, said afterward. She helped distribute about 170 “No Data Center” lawn signs that now dot the surrounding roads. “I don’t want an industrial wasteland a mile from my house,” she said. “I can hear crickets at night.”
René Earnhardt, Kerry Earnhardt’s wife, was among the speakers at the meeting who advocated protecting the open land and the town’s quiet charm from overdevelopment.
“Wealth and power are a destructive combination if used recklessly,” she said. “There’s only so much of this Earth that can be gambled away until there’s nothing left.”
Tract representatives did not speak at the meeting, but the company has previously pushed back on the residents’ criticisms. The nearest residents will hear nothing louder than the thrum of a refrigerator, Tract will pay for infrastructure upgrades that will supply the center with plenty of water and electricity, and the project will generate about 1,000 jobs during construction and 200 permanently, thecompany said in a presentation. The company currently has 10 projects underway in five states, including Texas, Virginia, Minnesota and Nevada.
Donna Jones, 54, was drawn to Mooresville’s quiet and safety a decade ago when she and her husband were looking for a place to raise their sons. They bought chickens, then goats and ducks, and they never worried when the boys played outside.
“We had a little farm, and we thought we had paradise,” she said.
That little farm is about half a mile from the proposed data center. She worries that the disruption will make it difficult to stay, and just as difficult to leave.
“These are our lives,” she said. “Our property value. What’s going to happen to that? Who’s going to want to buy or build a house next to a data center?”
In a town where many residents still remember Dale Earnhardt or are friendly with his kin, there is a feeling of protectiveness around the racing star, which extends to the land where he spent time.
“Dale was a hero of mine,” saidH.A. Mergen, who spoke at Monday’s board meeting. “This land is Dale’s legacy — make no mistake about it. I believe we all know what Dale would want his legacy to be.”

Stanford Universitywill continue to use legacy and donor status in its admissions process by opting out of the state’s Cal Grant financial aid program, a move that would allow it to skirt a statewide ban on legacy admissions.The announcement comes just a few weeks beforeAssembly Bill 1780, which was signed into law last year, takes effect Sept. 1. The lawprohibits legacy or donor-driven preferencesin admissions at any university “that receives, or benefits from, state-funded student financial assistance or that enrolls students who receive state-funded student financial assistance,” including private institutions like Stanford.Colleges that receive state funding and continue to give legacy preference risk an increased burden of reporting requirements to the state government, as well as being publicly listed as noncompliant on the California Department of Justice’s website.
Stanford Universitywill continue to use legacy and donor status in its admissions process by opting out of the state’s Cal Grant financial aid program, a move that would allow it to skirt a statewide ban on legacy admissions.
The announcement comes just a few weeks beforeAssembly Bill 1780, which was signed into law last year, takes effect Sept. 1. The lawprohibits legacy or donor-driven preferencesin admissions at any university “that receives, or benefits from, state-funded student financial assistance or that enrolls students who receive state-funded student financial assistance,” including private institutions like Stanford.
Colleges that receive state funding and continue to give legacy preference risk an increased burden of reporting requirements to the state government, as well as being publicly listed as noncompliant on the California Department of Justice’s website.
By withdrawing from Cal Grant, the state-funded financial aid program that provides millions of dollars a year to support hundreds of its students, Stanford will be able to continue those admissions practices without being subject to the law.
In a statement postedonlineJuly 29, university officials said Stanford will use university scholarship funding instead of state financial assistance programs, including Cal Grant.
A spokesperson for Stanford told KQED that the university will continue to evaluate how legacy status is considered in its admissions process.
Assemblymember Phil Ting, who introduced AB 1780, has said he was inspired to target legacy admissions by theVarsity Blues scandal, in which wealthy parents paid bribes to get their children into elite schools, including Stanford, USC, UC Berkeley and UCLA through side doors.
Student organizers, meanwhile, have also taken aim at university admissions policies that they say favor the children of wealthy and influential parents.
Ryan Cieslikowski, a Stanford alum who benefited from financial aid for students from less privileged backgrounds, said his experience there led him toClass Action, a nationwide nonprofit of students, alumni and faculty members who advocate for tackling classism and inequality within higher education.
Now a lead organizer for the nonprofit, he said his research showed schools like Stanford accept “more students from the top 1% of the income distribution than the entire bottom 50%.”
His fellow Stanford organizers traveled to Sacramento three times to testify before the state Legislature when AB 1780 was still in the process of becoming law.
“These are the various students whose children stand to benefit from legacy admissions in the future,” Cieslikowski said. “Even the people who stand to benefit from it disproportionately don’t think that their institution should practice it.”
He said that while the Trump administration is “exploiting America’s mistrust” of elite education for political purposes, universities should be striving to demonstrate that they serve the public interest, but “Stanford’s decision to continue legacy and donor preference does the exact opposite of that.”
The university’s legacy admissions statement was posted just two days before it announced sweepinglayoffsof over 350 employees and a $140 million budget cut.
“Stanford has decided that accepting the disproportionately privileged children of Stanford alumni and Stanford donors is more important than taking free money from the state of California in order to provide financial aid for their low-income students,” Cieslikowski said. “Especially in the face of massive layoffs.”
The Stanford spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up question seeking to specify whether the decision to substitute university funding for Cal Grant was a factor or point of discussion in the budget cut.
Cieslikowski referenced Leland Stanford’s quote upon founding the institution in 1885: that “The children of California shall be our children.”
“By clinging to legacy preference, the university is sending the exact opposite message,” he said. “Saying that the children of wealthy alumni and donors come first, they shall be our children.”

A Washington, D.C., man facing charges of assault of a federal officer after he allegedly threw a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent during a confrontation this week, worked for the Department of Justice at the time, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Sean Charles Dunn faces federal charges for allegedly throwing a Subway sandwich at a CBP agent who was patrolling with Metro Transit Police in northwest Washington around 11 p.m. on Sunday.
On Thursday morning, Bondi said Dunn had been fired from his job. Dunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs, according to a DOJ official.
""I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice -- NO LONGER,"" Bondi said in a social media post. ""Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.""
Bondi added, ""You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.""
According to the criminal complaint, Dunn approached the officer while shouting ""f--- you! You f------ fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!""
After several minutes of confrontation on Sunday, Dunn allegedly threw the sandwich, striking the officer in the chest, the complaint says. The alleged incident was apparently captured in a video posted to Instagram.
Dunn was apprehended after attempting to flee, authorities said, and later admitted to the incident while being processed at the police station, allegedly telling an officer, ""I did it. I threw the sandwich.""
While Bondi said in her statement that individuals will ""NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement,"" last week the department publicly stood byJared Wise's continued employment at DOJ. Wise was pardoned by President Donald Trump while on trial for his participation in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. Wise wasallegedly seen on videoscalling cops ""Nazis"" and screaming ""Kill 'em!"" at officers under assault by the pro-Trump mob.
""Jared Wise is a valued member of The Department of Justice and we appreciate his contributions to our team,"" a Justice Department spokesperson told ABC News in a statement on Aug. 8.
ABC News reached out to Bondi's spokesperson for comment following claims of Dunn's dismissal.
The incident comes amid heightened tensions over federal law enforcement presence in the district. Trump recently deployed National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., declaring a public safety emergency and putting the Metropolitan Police Department under partial federal oversight for 30 days.
District Council Member Brooke Pinto, who chairs the Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, expressed concern about the increased federal presence.
""It paints a picture of a city that is not my own and is not the experience of the vast majority of district residents and visitors,"" Pinto told ABC News.
While Trump has cited rising crime as justification for federal intervention,police statisticsshow violent crime has actually decreased.
“Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year,” D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb said onsocial media.
The president maintained his stance, saying Wednesday, ""Fighting crime is a good thing. ... Instead of saying 'He's a dictator,' they should say, 'We're going to join him and make Washington safe.'""
Dunn has not yet appeared in court. ABC News has reached out to his attorney, Sabrina Shroff, for comment.

Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskysaid more than 20 people were killed in a ""brutally savage"" Russian airstrike on Yarova in Donetsk at a place where pensions were being handed out.
""Directly on people. Ordinary civilians. At the very moment when pensions were being disbursed,"" Zelensky said in a statement shared on social media along with a graphic video showing the aftermath of the strike, with bodies scattered around a charred vehicle.
""According to preliminary information, more than 20 people were killed. There are no words... My condolences to all the families and loved ones of the victims.""
Newsweekhas contacted the Russian foreign ministry's press service for comment via email.
The latest strike adds pressure on PresidentDonald Trumpto make good on his threats of tougher action against Russia if it fails to agree to a peace deal with Ukraine soon. Trump has for months sought to broker an end to the Russian invasion.
Zelensky said that Russian strikes ""must not be left without an appropriate response from the world.
""The Russians continue destroying lives while avoiding new strong sanctions and new strong blows.""
He continued: ""The world must not remain silent. The world must not remain idle. A response is needed from the United States. A response is needed from Europe. A response is needed from the G20. Strong actions are needed to make Russia stop bringing death.""
Trump indicated that he wasmoving towards additional sanctions targeting Russiaand its major trading partners—including punitive secondary tariffs—because Moscow was intensifying its war in Ukraine instead of making peace.
He has already imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on Indian goods as a result of its buying Russian oil.
The U.S. leader has also urged Kyiv's European allies to take greater action against Russia and its key partners, including China. He told the European states still purchasing Russian oil to stop.
Russia has said sanctions have no meaningful impact on its war policy and that it remains committed to achieving its goals in Ukraine. It also accuses Ukraine of carrying out regular strikes that kill Russian civilians.
Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian PresidentVladimir Putin, blamed Kyiv and its European allies for keeping more sanctions at the forefront of the agenda for Washington.
""Overall, one thing can probably be said: This unprecedented number of sanctions that have been imposed on our country over the past—well, it's already almost four years, now four years—have had no effect whatsoever,"" Peskov told Russian journalist Alexander Yunashev.
""They have proven absolutely useless in terms of putting pressure on Russia,"" Peskov said, originally in Russian, in a video posted to the Yunashev LIVE channel on Telegram on Monday September 8.
Putin has said a peace deal to end the war inUkraine is ""practically impossible,""citing ""technical difficulties"" and casting doubt on Ukraine's political will.
Speaking at an Eastern Economic Forum event in Russia's Vladivostok on Friday, Putin noted that Kyiv was seeking high-level direct contacts, including a meeting between himself and Zelensky.
But he added that he didn't see ""much sense in it.""
""Why? Because it will be practically impossible to reach an agreement with the Ukrainian side on key issues, even if there were political will—which I doubt,"" Putin said, originally in Russian.
""There are also technical difficulties,"" Putin noted, pointing to Ukraine's constitutional requirement for referenda on any new territorial agreements—a process that cannot take place while the country is under martial law.
""If martial law is lifted, presidential elections must immediately be held. After the referendum, if it takes place, depending on the results, approval from the Constitutional Court is required,"" Tass quoted Putin as saying.
Putin said Ukraine's Constitutional Court was not functioning because it was in the grip of a political crisis.
Russia now controls around a fifth of Ukrainian territory since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. It had earlier invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014 and annexed the strategic Black Sea peninsula of Crimea.
The Kremlin says the main ""root causes"" of its invasion are Ukraine's moves towardsNATOmembership—a red line for Russian national security—and what it claims is the persecution of ethnic Russians there.
Kyiv denies mistreating its ethnic Russian population, and says as a sovereign country it should be free to make its own choices about joining alliances such as NATO. Ukraine has accused Russia of an imperial war of conquest that sought to erase Ukrainian sovereignty and identity.
A peace deal to end the war hangs on two key issues: The division of territory and the future architecture of Ukrainian security, both fraught with legal and political complexities.
On territory, Ukraine says its constitution precludes it from conceding any land. It also cannot hold referenda or elections that could resolve this issue while it is in a state of martial law due to Russia's invasion. But Russia is refusing to agree to a ceasefire.
And on security, Ukraine is seeking ironclad guarantees against Russian aggression in the future, including Western peacekeeping troops on the ground. But Russia has ruled out agreeing to the presence of Western troops in Ukraine, especially those from NATO allies.

Texas police have released images of the suspected gunman at Alas Locas sports bar in Cleveland
I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read ourPrivacy notice
Amanhuntis underway after agunman killed one personand wounded five others who were drinking in abar near Houston, Texas,early Sunday.
The shooting at Alas Locas sports bar inCleveland, around 45 miles northeast of Houston, was captured on security footage now being reviewed by investigators, the Liberty County Sheriff's Office said.
One critically-injured victim was rushed to Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, having been at the bar with his wife, according to officials. Five men and women were also shot, with two left in critical condition, Capt. David Myers of theLiberty CountySheriff's Office said.
Witnesses said the suspect had been sitting alone at the bar quietly drinking for about an hour before leaving. He then returned around 2:30 a.m. local time and opened fire outside the bar, Myers said.
The gunman used either a .40 or .45-caliber handgun before fleeing in a white van which had no side windows, authorities added. Myers said at least 20 shots were fired, based on the number of shell casings which investigators found at the scene.
Police released images of the suspect, showing a man in a blue t-shirt smoking a cigarette in a car park, standing near a white van.
The shooter’s identity and motives are still under investigation by police, who hope the security footage will help with identification.
Cops have asked anyone who lives in the area to check their security cameras for footage of the van. Anyone who can help can call the sheriff's office at 936-336-4500 or call Crime Stoppers.
The incident comes after a similar shooting in the Houston area earlier this year. Six people were shot at the Latinas Sports Bar in southwest Houston on March 23.
Four people were critically injured in the shooting, which led to the arrest of 25-year-old Venezuelan national Jose Miguel Briceno, who was charged with aggravated assault mass shooting.
Police are still on the hunt for a second suspect who is believed to have fled to Mexico, according to authorities.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/29/politics/kamala-harris-secret-service-canceled-trump-biden,t3_1n35gc8,Trump cancels Kamala Harris’ Secret Service detail that was extended by undisclosed Biden order,guesthost1999,2025-08-29 11:59:02,32655,1593,N/A,N/A,N/A,"President Donald Trump revoked Kamala Harris’ Secret Service protection on Thursday, according to a copy of a letter reviewed by CNN.
Former presidents receive Secret Service protection for life. Harris, as a former vice president, received six months of protection after leaving office, according to federal law. That period ended on July 21. However, her protection had been extended for an additional year via a directive –﻿not made public until now – signed by then-President Joe Biden shortly before leaving office, according to multiple people familiar with the undisclosed arrangement.
That is the order Trump canceled in his letter, titled “Memorandum for the Secretary of Homeland Security” and dated Thursday.
“You are hereby authorized to discontinue any security-related procedures previously authorized by Executive Memorandum, beyond those required by law, for the following individual, effective September 1, 2025: Former Vice President Kamala D. Harris,” the letter reads in full.
The order to remove Harris’ detail came from the White House, one official with the Secret Service told CNN.
The decision was not part of a security review or new threat assessment, the source said. Leadership within the agency did not flag any security concerns or push back from the White House’s order, the official said, who noted that Harris’s detail would range from a dozen to a few dozen agents depending on her schedule and shift changes for 24-hour security.
Trump’s ending of Harris’ protection comes as she soon embarks on a multi-city, high-profile book tour around the release of “107 Days,” hernewmemoiron her short presidential campaign, set to be released September 23. That will put her more in the public spotlight than she has been since leaving office, during which time she’s attended only a few public events.
“The Vice President is grateful to the United States Secret Service for their professionalism, dedication, and unwavering commitment to safety,” Kirsten Allen, a Harris senior adviser, told CNN.
Presidents and presidential candidates face frequent security threats. There were two assassination attempts against Trump during his run for president last year.
Harris, according to people familiar with her security operations, faced particular security concerns given that she was the first woman and first Black woman in the role. Those concerns only increased after she became the nominee, the people familiar with her security operations told CNN, and was still at a high level into January following the campaign, with feelings about the election still raw.
A Biden spokesperson declined to comment on what led to his signing the order extending Harris’ protection.
But what will now disappear is not just the agents assigned to guard her in person, 24-7: Secret Service protection includes constant analysis of threat intelligence and covering in-person situations, emails, texts and social media. With her detail canceled, Harris aides are worried they will lose the same access to threat warnings, the people familiar with her security operations said. Her home, in the middle of Los Angeles, will also stop being protected by federal agents.
Trump rescinds security clearances of political rivals Harris, Clinton and others
The cost of mounting any similar level of protection privately would be expensive, possibly going into the millions of dollars annually.
Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, lost his own personal detail on July 21 under the standard provisions for a former vice president’s spouse.
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom was briefed on Harris losing her protection late Thursday. A person familiar with the discussions told CNN that the governor’s office could not comment on security arrangements or methods which may be activated as a replacement.
However, Newsom spokesperson Bob Salladay expressed outrage about Trump making the change.
“The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulses,” Salladay told CNN.
Harris, as a Los Angeles resident, could also receive protection from the city police department. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom were in touch Thursday evening about the situation.
“This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances and more. This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the Governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles,” Bass told CNN in a statement.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04ryk6ed5lo,t3_1n03npq,Judge temporarily blocks Abrego Garcia's deportation,paulfromatlanta,2025-08-25 21:43:35,32525,837,N/A,N/A,N/A,"A federal judge temporarily blocked the US government from deporting Kilmar Ábrego García to another country, after immigration officers took him into custody at a check-in this morning.
The government brought Mr Ábrego García back to the US after mistakenly deporting him to a notorious prison in El Salvador in March, and has since charged him with human trafficking.
US authorities told Mr Ábrego García he may be deported to Uganda, following his refusal to accept a plea deal, his lawyers say.
Mr Ábrego García filed a new federal lawsuit challenging his current detention and potential deportation ""to Uganda or any other country"" until he has a trial.
At Tuesday's hearing, US District Judge Paula Xinis said she was barring the government from deporting Mr Ábrego García until she could hold a hearing on the matter.
She also raised questions about the government's intention to deport him to Uganda.
She said the US failed to demonstrate that Mr Ábrego García would not face harm if deported to Uganda.
The judge also expressed concerns that the government would send him to a country where he had no connections, should he not plead guilty to criminal charges.
""It is in my view plain that you can't do that,"" Judge Xinis said. ""You can't condition the relinquishment of constitutional rights in that regard.""
""You'd never get a knowing and voluntary guilty plea out of anyone if you do that,"" she said.
Two existing court orders bar the government from deporting him from the continental US until Wednesday afternoon.
""My understanding is that removal is not imminent,"" government attorney Drew Ensign told Judge Xinis. He noted that ""third country removal takes some time"".
Judge Xinis told Mr Ensign that the Trump administration was ""absolutely forbidden"" to remove Mr Ábrego García while those orders were in effect.
ICE is currently holding Mr Ábrego García at a facility in the state of Virginia, his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg told Judge Xinis.
He asked that the judge order his client remain detained within 200 miles of the court in order to ensure he had swift access to his legal proceedings.
Judge Xinis asked both parties to submit briefs this week ahead of a potential hearing.She is the same jurist who oversaw the initial lawsuit over Mr Ábrego García's mistaken deportation to El Salvador.
On Monday morning, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) took Mr Ábrego García into custody after summoning him to a mandatory immigration meeting in Baltimore.
Before going inside, Mr Ábrego García addressed a crowd of supporters and protesters gathered outside the building.
""Brothers and sisters, my name is Kilmar Ábrego García,"" he said. ""And I always want you to remember that today, I can say with pride, that I am free and have been reunited with my family.""
He was back in custody shortly after.
In a statement, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem confirmed his arrest and said that ICE ""are processing him for deportation"".
In a subsequent post on X, the Department of Homeland Security said ""he will be processed for removal to Uganda"".
The Trump administration spent much of the day alleging Mr Ábrego García was a criminal as justification for his latest action. The official White House X account posted an stylised image of Mr Ábrego García with the slogan ""MS-13"" appearing in bold letters beneath his face.
In a statement, Ms Noem alleged Mr Ábrego García was guilty of human trafficking and domestic abuse. President Donald Trump would not allow him to ""terrorise American citizens any longer"", she said.
Mr Ábrego García's legal team accuses the US of trying to ""coerce"" him to plead guilty by threatening to re-deport him ""halfway across the world"".
""The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him, to punish him for exercising his constitutional rights,"" Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg told reporters outside the ICE office.
A subsequent court order barred the government from removing Mr Ábrego García from the continental United States or altering his legal status until 16:00 Wednesday, unless a judge extends the order.
His lawyers said their client declined an offer to plead guilty to human smuggling charges in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica. He was asked to check in on Monday at the field office in Baltimore.
During the interview, Mr Sandoval-Moshenberg said ICE officers had taken Mr Ábrego García into custody with no explanation. An officer told the attorneys he would be taken to a detention centre but would not specify which one.
His attorney argued there was no reason to detain Mr Ábrego García, as he was under ankle monitoring and ""basically on house arrest"".
The US reached bilateral deportation agreements with Honduras and Uganda as part of the Trump crackdown on illegal immigration.
Uganda's ministry of foreign affairs announced last Thurdsay that it had reached atemporary agreement with the United States with respect to ""third country nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin"".
However, Uganda stated a preference to take individuals from African countries, and said it would not take individuals with criminal records or unaccompanied minors.
The saga of Mr Ábrego García's deportation case has been in the news since March when he was deported to his native El Salvador despite a court order blocking such action,and initially kept in the notorious Cecot prison.
But after US government officials acknowledged he was deported due to an ""administrative error"", a judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return.
He was sent to Tennessee where he was charged in a human smuggling scheme and detained until his release on Friday after a ruling by a federal judge.
Mr Ábrego García haspleaded not guilty to the charges.
The latest batch of Epstein files released by Congress give an insight into the convicted sex offender's sprawling and elite social circle.
The US president says he feels ""very badly"" about the location of the attack and calls Qatar a ""close ally"".
The judge said the group was not ""savvy or sophisticated enough to understand fully the electoral process"".
An image of a ""birthday letter"" to Jeffrey Epstein, allegedly signed by Donald Trump, has been released - but the White House says it is a fake.
It will amount to the biggest test of Trump's presidential authority and his signature economic policy.

The report is said to highlight the pain reliever Tylenol, when taken during pregnancy, along with low levels of folate,a vitamin that is important for proper development of a baby’s brain and spine, as potential causes of autism, according to the Wall Street Journal. It will also name folinic acid, a form of folate also known as leucovorin, as a way to decrease symptoms of autism.
Folate supplementsare already recommendedfor women during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, in infants.
Tylenol, which is the brand name of the generic pain reliever acetaminophen, is widely used in the US, including during pregnancy. Drugmaker Kenvue said in a statement Friday, “Nothing is more important to us than the health and safety of the people who use our products. We have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism.”
Experts generally agree.
“There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues,” Dr. Christopher Zahn, chief of clinical practice for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement Friday. “Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause. Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.”
Kennedy said there will be autism answers this month. With public health agencies in upheaval, autism advocates are alarmed
Theincidenceof autism in the US is on the rise. About 1 in every 31 children was diagnosed with autism by age 8 in 2022, up from 1 in 36 in 2020, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published in April.
There are two primary reasons for the increase, according to Dr. Christine Ladd-Acosta, vice director of the Wendy Klagg Center for Autism at John Hopkins.
The first is that the definition of autism was broadened by the psychiatric community in 2013, so more people now qualify for an autism diagnosis.
Secondly, there has been a push for better screening of children, especially babies, for signs of autism. That push for increased awareness of the symptoms has been accompanied by a greater acceptance of the disorder, so people are not as afraid to seek help or to be identified as having autism, Ladd-Acosta said on the Johns Hopkins podcast “Public Health on Call.”
An HHS spokesperson said Friday that the agency is “using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America’s unprecedented rise in autism rates. Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation.”
Several studies have looked at the association between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and the development of autism in children, but experts say the science behind this theory is not settled.
A 2024study published in JAMAlooked at more than 2 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019, about 185,000 of the whom were born to mothers who used acetaminophen during pregnancy. The study compared autism rates between these children with their siblings and with children who were not exposed, and it found that acetaminophen use during pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
A meta-analysispublished in Augustin the journal BMC Environmental Health looked at 46 studies on the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Six of the studies looked specifically at acetaminophen and autism. Overall, the analysis concluded that there was “strong evidence of an association” between taking acetaminophen during pregnancy and the development of autism in children, but the authors caution that their paper can show only associations, not that acetaminophen causes autism.
“We recommend judicious acetaminophen use — lowest effective dose, shortest duration — under medical guidance, tailored to individual risk–benefit assessments, rather than a broad limitation,” the researchers wrote.
RFK Jr. vowed to find the environmental causes of autism. Then he shut down research trying to do just that
The US Food and Drug Administrationreviewedthe risks of certain types of pain relievers during pregnancy in 2015 and said that all the studies it reviewed had methodological flaws. As a result, the agency said it would not change its recommendations for pain medications during pregnancy at that time.
The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine also reviewed the issue in 2017. Itconcludedthat “the weight of evidence is inconclusive regarding a possible causal relationship between acetaminophen use and neurobehavioral disorders in the offspring.”
The Autism Science Foundation said in a statement Friday that “Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science. … The Autism Science Foundation strongly supports research into autism’s causes. More research needs to be done before alarming families or suggesting steps that may not actually reduce risk.”
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has previously promoted debunked theories linking vaccines to autism, and he pledged in April that his agency would haveanswersthis month on the causes of autism. Thousands of researchers from top universities and institutions have applied for federal funding for autism research that Kennedy announced in April, and the US National Institutes of Health is expected this month to announce up to 25 awardees for the $50 million effort.
“We’re finding … certain interventions now that are clearly, almost certainly causing autism, and we’re going to be able to address those in September,” Kennedy said in a Cabinet meeting last month, to which President Donald Trump responded, “There has to be something artificial causing this, meaning, a drug or something.”
Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatrician who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, said it would be irresponsible for Kennedy to cast any one or two things as a “smoking gun” cause of autism.
“That’s not how it works,” said Hotez, who has a daughter with autism and has written a book about the condition.
“We have autism genes, and it’s really important to look at some of the environmental toxins out there that are interacting with autism genes. And it may be possible to compile a list. … But I think it would be reckless to hone in just on those two, at least in terms of the publicly available data,” he said.
Shares of Kenvue fell about 10% midday after the Wall Street Journal report came out.

The Free DC Project hosted the We Are All DC: A National March with the goal of ending what they call the Trump administration’s occupation of the city.
It comes as D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, a Democrat,filed a lawsuit Thursdaysaying National Guard troops are illegally patrolling neighborhoods throughout the city.
That same day, the D.C. National Guardannounced it’s extending its deploymentthrough the end of November.
Natalie Howe, a rally-goer and D.C. resident, said the guard deployment isn’t necessary.
“Washington, D.C. is safe enough for me to have my kid in, and I really like it here,” she said. “And, as, as you know, from looking at the crime stats, the crime is not the problem in D.C.”
Stats show crime was at a 30-year-low in DC before the federal crackdown began in August, however violent crime has continued to drop since the enforcement surge.
The federal takeover of the DC police force is also set to end Wednesday unless Congress authorizes an extension.

“At the direction of the Secretary of Defense, (Joint Task Force) JTF-DC members supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our Nation’s capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training,” the official said.

(Gray News) - Fifteen nurses have been fired at a Washington state children’s hospital after a 12-year-old girl died by suicide at the facility where she was advised to have 24-hour supervision.
According to a filed lawsuit, on the night of April 13, Sarah Niyimbona, 12, left her room in the Sacred Heart Children’s Hospital and died after jumping off a parking garage.
Beginning in late 2024, Sarah was repeatedly admitted to Sacred Heart’s emergency department because of multiple attempts to end her own life.
The filing saysthat despite the need for 24-hour supervision of Sarah, Providence removed the health care worker assigned to monitor her, along with removing the video monitoring system from her room.
On that tragic night, the lawsuit accuses the staff of failing to supervise the child, allowing her to escape in the early evening to walk freely throughout the hospital.
Sarah then reached the fourth floor of the parking structure on the hospital, where she jumped off, suffering catastrophic injuries.
Fifteen nurses have since been fired, and one nurse was disciplined after being questioned over how Sarah was able to leave her room undetected,according to the Spokesman-Review.
According to multiple reports, the nurses improperly accessed Sarah’s medical records without being directly involved in her care, a potential violation of the federal health privacy law HIPAA.
The union said the nurses have filed a grievance, a process that “could take a long time” to resolve.
Sarah was remembered on aGoFundMe pageas a “shining light” who “touched the hearts of everyone she met.”

Inflation edged higher in July, according to theFederal Reserve’s preferredinflationmeasure, indicating that PresidentDonald Trump’s tariffs are working their way through the U.S. economy.
Thepersonal consumption expenditures price indexshowed that coreinflation, which excludes food and energy costs, ran at a 2.9% seasonally adjusted annual rate, according to a Commerce Department report Friday. That was up 0.1 percentage point from the June level and the highest annual rate since February, though in line with the Dow Jones consensus forecast.
On a monthly basis, the core PCE index increased 0.3%, also in line with expectations. The all-items index showed the annual rate at 2.6% and the monthly gain at 0.2%, also hitting the consensus outlook.
The Fed uses the PCE price index as its primary forecasting tool. Though it watches both numbers, policymakers consider core inflation to be a better indicator of longer-term trends as it excludes the volatile gas and groceries figures.
Central bankers target inflation at 2%, so Friday’s report shows the economy still a distance from where the Fed feels comfortable.
Nevertheless, markets expect the Fed to resume lowering its benchmark interest rate when policymakers convene next month. Fed Governor Christopher Waller reiterated his support for a cut in a speech Thursday, saying he would entertain a larger move if labor market data continue weakening.
“The Fed opened the door to rate cuts, but the size of that opening is going to depend on whether labor-market weakness continues to look like a bigger risk than rising inflation,” said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. “Today’s in-line PCE Price Index will keep the focus on the jobs market. For now, the odds still favor a September cut.”
Trump in April imposed a baseline 10% tariff on all imports and since has leveled so-called reciprocal tariffs on multiple trading partners and slapped duties in individual goods as well. In addition, the White House has scrapped exceptions for goods under $800.
Along with the inflation moves, consumer spending increased 0.5% on the month, in line with forecasts and indicative of strength despite the higher prices. Personal income accelerated 0.4%, rounding out a report that saw all figures hit the consensus outlook.
Stock marketfutures remained negative after the release while Treasury yields held gains.
Inflation numbers were held in check by a 2.7% annual decline in prices for energy goods and services. Food prices rose 1.9% from a year ago. The balance also tilted heavily toward services prices, which jumped 3.6%, compared with just a 0.5% increase in goods.
On a monthly basis, energy was off 1.1% and food was down 0.1%. Services prices rose 0.3%, essentially accounting for all the monthly increase as goods decreased 0.1%.

Kim Keon Hee could face years in jail if found guilty.
Kim Keon Hee, the wife ofSouth Korea'sousted former President Yun Suk Yeol, has been charged with bribery among other crimes, a special prosecutor's team said on Friday. This is the first time in the country's history that a first lady has been indicted.
The charges are part of a wider probe into Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration last December, which threw the nation into a political crisis. Prosecutors, undernew liberal government headed by President Lee Jae Myung, have launched three special investigations targeting Yoon's circle.
Both Yoon and Kim are currently in jailwith the former president already undergoing trial for charges including insurrection.
The former defense minister, safety minister and several other senior military commanders and police officers have also been arrested for their involvement in the botched grab for power.
The prosecution has alleged Kim violated the Political Funds Act, the Capital Markets Act and accepted bribes for mediation, theKorean Heraldreported.
Prosecutors claimed the former first lady received polling data for Yoon 58 times at no cost during the 2022 presidential elections. She is also said to have used her influence to help a party member secure a party ticket. Apart from this, she faces allegations of stock manipulation and receiving bribes, such as a diamond necklace and Chanel bags, the newspaper reported.
Kim's lawyers have denied the charges, calling reports of bribery baseless speculation. Kim could be jailed for years if the charges levied against her are proven true in court.
Investigators have levied the charges some two months after the special investigation was launched and two weeks after Kim was detained under a special warrant.
Special prosecutors also indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo on Friday, on charges of abetting the former president and perjury.

The Food and Drug Administration is warning the public not to eat, sell or serve certain Great Value raw frozen shrimp sold at Walmart due to possible contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection alerted the FDA about possible Cesium-137, or Cs-137, detected in shipping containers at four U.S. ports, the FDA said Tuesdayin a press release. Testing on frozen shrimp from the distributor, Indonesia's BMS Foods, also tested positive, the FDA said.
However, no shrimp that has tested positive for Cesium-137 has entered the U.S. food supply, according to the FDA.
The FDA is still recommending a recall on all products from BMS Foods that were shipped after the company's shipping containers tested positive for Cesium-137, even though the products themselves have not tested positive.
The following Great Value brand frozen shrimp products should not be eaten, sold or served:
""If you have recently purchased raw frozen shrimp from Walmart that matches this description, throw it away,"" the FDA said in its press release.
The FDA said it is working with distributors and retailers that received the shrimp from BMS Foods ""to recommend that firms conduct a recall,"" according to the press release.
The FDA said it determined the shrimp from BMS Foods violates the Federal Food, Drug,& Cosmetic Act ""in that it appears to have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with Cs-137 and may pose a safety concern.""
All products from the company are now banned from coming into the U.S. ""until the firm has resolved the conditions that gave rise to the appearance of the violation,"" the FDA said.
Cesium is a soft, flexible, silvery-white metal that becomes liquid near room temperature, but easily bonds with chlorides to create a crystalline powder, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
External exposure to large amounts of Cesium-137, according to the EPA, can cause burns, acute radiation sickness and even death.

August 27, 2025 / 10:39 PM EDT/ CBS/AP
A missing 12-year-old boy with autism likely died following an alligator attack, police said Wednesday. A nearly two-week-long search resulted in his body being found in a New Orleans canal this week.
Bryan Vasquez was first reported missing on the morning of Aug. 14, after he reportedly escaped through a bedroom window on the East side of the city, the New Orleans Police Department said. Vasquez, who is nonverbal, was seen on doorbell camera footage wearing only a diaper and walking down the street alone, around 5:20 a.m. local time that morning. His body was found on Tuesday, located by a drone.
A police department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News in an email Wednesday that the Orleans Parish Coroner determined Bryan's cause of death ""was drowning with blunt trauma consistent with an alligator attack.""
As a result, the case has now transitioned from a missing juvenile investigation to an unclassified death investigation led by the police department's homicide division, the spokesperson said.
""Detectives are actively pursuing every lead and reviewing all circumstances surrounding Bryan's death,"" the spokesperson said. ""At this time, no individual has been charged or identified as a suspect. The investigation remains open and active, and updates will be shared as they are confirmed.""
The boy's mother, Hilda Vasquez, had toldThe New Orleans Advocate/The Times-Picayunethat her son would often sneak away from their home to head to a playground nearby. However, they'd recently moved to a new house.
Bryan's disappearance prompted a massive search that included multiple agencies, volunteers, airboats and bloodhounds.
As local and state crews combed the area, criticism mounted over the New Orleans Police Department's delayed response. Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick said that there was a nearly five-hour gap between when the boy was reported missing and an officer arriving at the scene. The boy was found about 200 yards from where the search had started. Kirkpatrick said it is possible his body resurfaced after he died, which is common in drowning deaths.
In a separate news release, city officials described Bryan as ""a bright, charismatic, and energetic young boy whose joy and spirit touched the lives of his family, friends and community.""
Kirkpatrick said she has asked the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to remove ""nuisance"" alligators from the area where Bryan was found.
According to the wildlife agency, hunters capture and remove more than 1,000 nuisance alligators every year in an effort to minimize encounters between the alligators and humans. Louisiana is home to the largest alligator population in the country.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — The Utah Legislature will need to rapidly redraw the state’scongressional boundariesafter a judge ruled Monday that the Republican-controlled body circumvented safeguards put in place by voters to ensure districts aren’t drawn to favor any party.
The current map, adopted in 2021, dividesSalt Lake County— Utah’s population center and a Democratic stronghold — among the state’s four congressional districts, all of which have since elected Republicans by wide margins.
District Court Judge Dianna Gibson made few judgments on the content of the map but declared it unlawful because lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering.
“The nature of the violation lies in the Legislature’s refusal to respect the people’s exercise of their constitutional lawmaking power and to honor the people’s right to reform their government,” Gibson said in the ruling.
New maps will need to be drawn quickly, before candidates start filing in early January for the 2026 midterm elections. The ruling gives lawmakers a deadline of Sept. 24 and allows voting rights groups involved in the legal challenge to submit alternate proposals to the court.
But appeals expected from Republican officials could help them run out the clock to possibly delay adopting new maps until 2028.
The ruling creates uncertainty in a state that was thought to be a clean sweep for the GOP as the party is preparing to defend its slim majority in the U.S. House. Nationally, Democrats need to net three seats next year to take control of the chamber. The sitting president’s party tends to lose seats in the midterms, as was the case for President Donald Trump in 2018.
Trump has urged several Republican-led states to add winnable seats for the GOP. InTexas, a plan awaiting Gov. Greg Abbott’s approval includes five new districts that would favor Republicans. Ohio Republicans already were scheduled to revise their maps to make them more partisan, and Indiana, Florida and Missouri may choose to make changes. Some Democrat-led states say they may enter theredistrictingarms race, but so far only California has taken action to offset GOP gains in Texas.
The U.S. Supreme Court is unlikely to intervene, and the Utah Supreme Court may be hesitant to entertain an appeal of Monday’s ruling after it had sent the case back to Gibson for her to decide.
The nation’s high court in 2019 ruled that claims of partisan gerrymandering for congressional and legislative districts areoutside the purview of federal courtsand should be decided by states.
David Reymann, an attorney for the voting rights advocates who challenged the map, called the ruling a “watershed moment” for the voices of Utah voters.
“The Legislature in this state is not king,” Reymann told reporters Monday evening.
Leaders from the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee applauded the ruling as a victory for democracy.
Republican Gov. Spencer Cox said he disagrees with the decision but holds respect for Utah’s judiciary. Meanwhile, the state’s GOP Chairman, Robert Axson, dismissed the ruling as “judicial activism.”
Utah’s Republican legislative leaders, Senate President Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz, said in a joint statement that they are disappointed by the ruling and are carefully considering their next steps.
In 2018, voters narrowly approved a ballot initiative that created an independent redistricting commission to draw boundaries for Utah’s legislative and congressional districts, which the Legislature was required to consider. Lawmakers repealed the initiative in 2020 and replaced it with a law that transformed the commission into an advisory board that they could choose to ignore.
The following year, lawmakers disregarded a congressional map proposal from the commission and drew one of their own that carved up Salt Lake County among four reliably Republican districts.
Voting rights advocates sued, arguing the map drawn by lawmakers constituted partisan gerrymandering that favored Republicans. They also said the Legislature violated the rights of voters when it repealed and replaced the 2018 initiative.
The case made its way to the Utah Supreme Court, which ruled that the Legislature cannot change laws approved through ballot initiatives except to reinforce them, or to advance a compelling government interest. The five-member panelsent the case back to Gibson in the lower courtto decide whether lawmakers would have to redraw boundaries set as part of aredistrictingprocess that happens every 10 years.
The ruling Monday reinstates the voter-approved redistricting standards that lawmakers had overturned.
Utah was one of four states where voters approved measures designed to reduce partisan gerrymandering in 2018. As in Utah, Missouri’s Republican-led Legislature quickly sought to repeal key provisions. Missouri voters approved the Legislature’s revisions in 2020, before the original plan was ever used. Independent commissions approved by Colorado and Michigan voters remained in place and were used after the 2020 census.
The redistricting measures aren’t the only instances where state lawmakers have altered voter-approved measures.
Earlier this year, Missouri lawmakers repealed a paid sick leave law passed by voters and referred a proposed repeal of an abortion rights amendment to the ballot. In South Dakota, voters approved a public campaign finance system, tightened lobbying laws and created an ethics commission in 2016. Lawmakers repealed and replaced the measure the next year with a narrower government watchdog board and looser limits on lobbyist gifts to public officials.

WATCH: 2-year-old girl shot during fight between adult sisters at Memphis barbecue, police say
MEMPHIS, Tenn. - Gun violence sent a 2-year-old girl to the hospital during a cookout at a home in Orange Mound, drawing reactions from nearby neighbors.
""The kids ain't asked to be involved in whatever was going on. It’s just sad,"" said one man who asked FOX13 not to share his name or show his face out of fear for personal safety.
A little girl was sent to the hospital after she was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight at a cookout around 11:15 Sunday night. MPD told FOX13 she is in stable and non-critical condition here at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital.
The child's parents transported her for emergency medical care in their own vehicle last night. MPD said the child was in stable and non-critical condition. The hospital staff there then alerted police. That investigation led officers to a home in the 1100 block of Semmes Street.
The girl's father told officers when he arrived there, the woman who had invited him was fighting with her sister inside the house. When he went in to find out what was going on, he was approached by the sister's brother, who told him to get back and then reportedly pushed him. When the girls' father pushed back, he claims that man drew a weapon and started shooting.
He returned fire, but when the shooting stopped, the man was grazed, and his 2-year-old daughter had been hit.
FOX13 spoke with a neighbor, Tamika Malone, who said she heard the shooting.
""It's real scary 'cause I was standing outside when it happened. I really didn’t think it was just that close. I thought it was across the street actually, and somebody who I was in the car with, they was like, 'You don’t know nothing about over here. These people over here are crazy,'” Malone said.
The police report indicated a person was detained and questioned. Monday afternoon MPD clarified that person is not a suspect and no arrest warrants have been issued for anyone currently, but the investigation continues.

Colorado sheriff'sdeputies launcheda massive search for a man wanted for stabbing a park ranger — only to learn the reported attack was an ""elaborate hoax,""officials saidThursday.
Callum Heskett, a Colorado Parks and Wildlife seasonal ranger atStaunton State Park, will face multiple misdemeanor and felony counts stemming from the allegedly false report, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.
Heskett, 26, radioed for help at about 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, saying he'd been stabbed before giving a detailed description of his attacker who had fled on foot at the state park near Denver, officials said.
The sheriff's department sent an alert to 8,600 local residents to look out for the suspect while several ""schools and nearby citizens were asked to remain locked down for safety,"" according to the sheriff's statement.
The department's SWAT and drone teams and state air assets were senton the hunt for a 6-foot, 200-pound white male assailant, officials said, as Heskett was airlifted to the hospital.
Two ""people of interest were detained"" and interviewed, before they were released, according to the sheriff,
""As the investigation progressed, inconsistencies in Heskett’s statements emerged. That, along with other conflicting and questionable evidence, further raised concerns about the validity of his allegations,"" the sheriff continued.
""After investigators conducted their first interview with Heskett, it became even more clear that his story was flawed and erroneous.""
The sheriff called the report by Heskett an ""elaborate hoax.""
It'sbelieved Heskett stabbed himselfand was still under a doctor's care on Thursday, officials said.
He's facing a slew of charges including felony suspicion of an attempt to influence a public servant and tampering with evidence along with misdemeanor false reporting to authorities, reckless endangerment and obstructing government operations and the petty offense of official misconduct.
It wasn't clear on Friday morning of Heskett had hired or been assigned a defense lawyer to speak on his behalf.
There were no answers at publicly listed phone numbers for Heskett and his parents when NBC News called, seeking their comments on Friday morning.

Black smoke rises from a damaged electronics manufacturing company after the Russian military hit a large American company producing civilian electronics with two missiles in Mukachevo, Zakarpattia region of Ukraine, Thursday.Zakarpattia Regional Military Administration/Anadolu via Getty Imageshide caption
KYIV, Ukraine — Two Russian cruise missiles slammed into an American electronics factory in a remote corner of far western Ukraine before dawn Thursday, causing extensive damage and more than a dozen injuries, according to Ukrainian officials.
The attack came as Russia carried out one of its largest airstrikes of the war, firing more than 570 drones and 40 missiles in an overnight barrage, according to the officials.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was one of several officials who took to social media to report the airstrike, saying at least 15 people were wounded.
In his post on theTelegrammessaging app, Zelenskyy called it an ""ordinary civilian enterprise, an American investment. They produced such familiar household items as coffee machines.""
The Ukrainian leader went on to say that the Russian military ""delivered this strike as if nothing had changed at all. As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.""
Contrary to all efforts to end the war, Russia undertook a massive combined air strike on Ukraine overnight.Hundreds of drones, hypersonic, ballistic, and cruise missiles on civilian and energy infrastructure.One of the missiles struck a major American electronics…pic.twitter.com/CTRoXpsk4y
The company that was hit,Flex, produces civilian electronic components and products with more than 100 offices and factories worldwide. The company was founded in the U.S., is listed on NASDAQ, and has headquarters in both Austin, Texas, and Singapore. Flex did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
Videos on social media showed thick black smoke rising from the company's plant in the town of Mukachevo, near the border with Hungary.
Some 600 workers were on the job when the missiles struck before 5 a.m., said Myroslav Biletskyi, head of the regional military administration. Before the attack, they heeded the air raid sirens and took cover in secure areas, he noted, or the casualty toll would have been much higher. He said about one-third of the massive plant burned down.
""This enterprise exclusively produced household appliances. It never produced any military equipment,"" Biletskyi said, adding that Flex had been operating at the site since 2012.
""Russia continues to destroy and humiliate U.S. businesses in Ukraine, targeting companies that invest and trade on the U.S. stock markets,"" Andy Hunder, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine,wrote on X. He said the factory was one of the largest U.S. investments in Ukraine by a private company.
Russia did not say why the plant was targeted.
Russia attacks western Ukraine less frequently than other areas. But the region was the focus of Russia's overnight barrage of hundreds of drones and missiles. Ukraine's military said it shot down most of the incoming weapons, but some managed to get through. One civilian was killed in Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, the military added.
The Russian strikes come just days after President Trump met separately withZelenskyy in Washingtonand Russia'sPresident Vladimir Putin in Alaskain an attempt to launch peace negotiations.
Trump has instructed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, to work on plans for security guarantees for Ukraine. However, any U.S. role would likely be limited to some form of air support. Trump has made clear he doesn't want U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine, even as peacekeepers after the war ends.
Caine has been talking to counterparts in European countries. Some European states say they could send troops at some point in the future, but the talks are still in a preliminary stage as the war rages on.
Ukrainians, meanwhile, believe Putin is still determined to carry on with the fighting. Ukrainians want Western security guarantees, but many say they should be ironclad.
""I strongly continue to believe that the only solution is NATO membership for Ukraine,"" said Oleksandr Merezhko, a member of the Ukrainian parliament who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee. ""This would stop the war. This would stop Putin's aggression because Putin is afraid of only one thing — NATO.""
Many Ukrainians share his position. Ukraine was initially promised a path toNATO membership in 2008, but there's been no real progress since, and Trump says it won't happen in the current environment.
Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, has spoken of a guarantee that could resemble NATO's Article 5 — which says an attack on one is an attack on all.
But Ukraine has had limited security promises in the past, and that hasn't stopped Russia from invading twice, first in 2014 and again on a much larger scale in 2022.
Russia remains staunchly opposed to Western troops in Ukraine. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated the country's position Wednesday, saying Russia should have veto power over security guarantees for Ukraine. That would effectively make any such guarantees meaningless.
Despite the recent flurry of diplomatic activity, neither Russia nor Ukraine has indicated a willingness to make major concessions.
""At the present moment, the interests, positions and stances of Ukraine and Russia are diametrically opposed and they cannot be reconciled,"" said Merezhko, the member of Ukraine's parliament.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdrkmk00jy0o,t3_1mwc9zx,Hundreds of thousands of Grok chats exposed in Google results,corbynista2029,2025-08-21 14:20:37,1031,110,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Hundreds of thousands of user conversations with Elon Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot Grok have been exposed in search engine results - seemingly without users' knowledge.
Unique links are created when Grok users press a button to share a transcript of their conversation - but as well as sharing the chat with the intended recipient, the button also appears to have made the chats searchable online.
A Google search on Thursday revealed it had indexed nearly 300,000 Grok conversations.
It has led one expert to describe AI chatbots as a ""privacy disaster in progress"".
The BBC has approached X for comment.
The appearance of Grok chats in search engine results was first reported by tech industry publication Forbes,which counted more than 370,000,externaluser conversations on Google.
Among chat transcripts seen by the BBC were examples of Musk's chatbot being asked to create a secure password, provide meal plans for weight loss and answer detailed questions about medical conditions.
Some indexed transcripts also showed users' attempts to test the limits on what Grok would say or do.
In one example seen by the BBC, the chatbot provided detailed instructions on how to make a Class A drug in a lab.
Who is Elon Musk?
What is AI and how do chatbots work?
It is not the first time that peoples' conversations with AI chatbots have appeared more widely than they perhaps initially realised when using ""share"" functions.
OpenAI recently rowed back an ""experiment"" which saw ChatGPT conversations appear in search engine results when shared by users.
A spokesperson told BBC News at the time it had been ""testing ways to make it easier to share helpful conversations, while keeping users in control"".
They said user chats were private by default and users had to explicitly opt-in to sharing them.
Earlier this year, Meta faced criticism after shared users conversations with its chatbot Meta AIappeared in a public ""discover"" feed on its app.
While users' account details may be anonymised or obscured in shared chatbot transcripts, their prompts may still contain - and risk revealing - personal, sensitive information about someone.
Experts say this highlights mounting concerns over users' privacy.
âAI chatbots are a privacy disaster in progress,â Prof Luc Rocher, associate professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, told the BBC.
They said ""leaked conversations"" from chatbots have divulged user information ranging from full names and location, to sensitive details about their mental health, business operations or relationships.
""Once leaked online, these conversations will stay there forever,"" they added.
Meanwhile Carissa Veliz, associate professor in philosophy at Oxford University's Institute for Ethics in AI, said users not being told shared chats would appear in search results is ""problematic"".
""Our technology doesn't even tell us what it's doing with our data, and that's a problem,"" she said.

Delta Air Lines Flight 1893 was flying from Orlando International to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport when passengers noticed something had partially broken away from the back of the wing.
“We felt it was bad turbulence. The plane was shaking,” passenger Shanila Arif told CNN. “The lady in front of us opened the window and told us it is broken. I opened the window and got scared.”
Video recorded by Arif showed the flap dangling behind the wing, as the plane flew at hundreds of miles an hour thousands of feet in the air.
She worried if the piece completely broke off it could hit the tail of the aircraft and cause a crash.
After landing “it was observed that a portion of the left wing’s flap was not in place,” Delta Air Lines said in a statement. “The aircraft has been taken out of service for maintenance.”
Flaps are surfaces on the back of the wing designed to be extended for takeoff and landing.
“We apologize to our customers for their experience as nothing is more important than the safety of our people and customers,” the airline said.
There were 62 passengers and six crew members onboard the plane. No one was injured.
Delta pledged to fully cooperate with the FAA investigation.

The 82-page order from U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams states that operations at the Everglades facility must cease within 60 days.
The facility also can't expand any further, including installing any new industrial lighting, fencing or other infrastructure.
The state and federal government are also ordered to remove most of the infrastructure from the site within 60 days—that includes the fencing, generators, sewage and waste disposal.
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ISSUED ON THE EVERGLADES IMMIGRANT DETENTION CAMP!The State of Florida must halt ALL NEW CONSTRUCTION, cannot bring *any* new detainees, and in 60 days they must dismantle the fencing, lighting and other infrastructure as the population diminishes.pic.twitter.com/bUqdPHOlQB
This preliminary injunction comes after alawsuit was filed by environmental groups, arguing that required environmental studies were not performed before construction began.
WPTV has beenclosely tracking the lawsuitagainst the state and federal governments by the environmental group Friends of the Everglades and the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida.
""This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, in a statement. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
The injunction formalized a temporary halt Williams had ordered two weeks ago as witnesses continued to testify in a multiday hearing to determine whether construction should end until the ultimate resolution of the case.
The judge said that she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed.
She wrote the state and federal defendants can't bring anyone other than those who are already being detained at the facility onto the property. The order does not prohibit modification or repairs to existing facilities, “which are solely for the purpose of increasing safety or mitigating environmental or other risks at the site,"" she said.
The preliminary injunction includes “those who are in active concert or participation with” the state of Florida or federal defendants or their officers, agents, employees,"" the judge wrote in an 82-page order.
The judge said state officials never explained sufficiently why the facility needed to be in the middle of the Florida Everglades.
“What is apparent, however, is that in their haste to construct the detention camp, the State did not consider alternative locations,” Williams said.

A judge ruled late Friday the Trump administration cannot deny funding to Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles and 30 other cities and counties because of policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration efforts.
U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco extended a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from cutting off or conditioning the use of federal funds for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Hisearlier orderprotected more than a dozen other cities and counties, including San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.
An email to the White House late Friday was not immediately returned. In his ruling, Orrick said the administration had offered no opposition to an extended injunction except to say the first injunction was wrong. It has appealed the first order.
Orrick also blocked the administration from imposing immigration-related conditions on two particular grant programs.
The Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on sanctuary communities as it seeks to make good on President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to remove millions of people in the country illegally.
One executive order issued by Trump directs Attorney GeneralPam Bondiand Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemto withhold federal money from sanctuary jurisdictions. Another order directs every federal agency to ensure that payments to state and local governments do not “abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”
The cities and counties that sued said billions of dollars were at risk.
Orrick, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, said the executive orders and the “executive actions that have parroted them” were an unconstitutional “coercive threat.”
In May, the Department of Homeland Securitypublished a list of more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions,”saying each one would receive formal notification that the government had deemed them noncompliant. It also said it would inform them if they were believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes.
The listwas later removedfrom the department’s website after critics noted it included localities that have actively supported the administration’s tough immigration policies.
The Justice Department has also sued New York, Los Angeles and other cities over their sanctuary policies.
There is no strict definition forsanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe places that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE enforces immigration laws nationwide but seeks help from state and local authorities to identify immigrants wanted for deportation and hold them for federal officers.

New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted Friday on federal charges of defrauding the city while trying to keep her romantic relationship with a police officer a secret, prosecutors said.
Cantrell is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to obstruct justice, making false statements and false declaration before a grand jury, according to a federal indictment filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana.
Shortly after the news broke, a lawyer for Cantrell told NBC News they had not yet seen the indictment and had no comment.
The city said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment.
""The Mayor’s attorney, Eddie Castaing, recently received the information, and is thoroughly reviewing the document,"" the statement said. ""Until his review is complete, the City will not comment further on this matter.""
Prosecutors allege that Cantrell was in a romantic relationship with Jeffrey Paul Vappie II, who served on the New Orleans Police Department's executive protection unit from May 2021 to April 2024.
“To hide their relations from detection and to maximize their time together, Cantrell and Vappie exploited their public positions to develop and implement a scheme to defraud the city of New Orleans and the New Orleans Police Department by engaging in personal activities while Vappie claimed to be on duty and was paid for,” the indictment states.
Vappie wasalready facing chargesof wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case andnew allegationsagainst Vappie.
He could not immediately be reached for comment Friday afternoon.
If convicted, Cantrell and Vappie could face years in prison. Some of the counts outlined in the indictment carry up to five years in prison, and others up to 20 years.
The pair's three-year fraud scheme exploited their public authority and position, Michael Simpson, an acting U.S. attorney with the Eastern District of Louisiana, said at a news conference Friday.
Cantrell was married during that period to attorney Jason Cantrell, who died in August 2023.
The mayor and Vappie have said their relationship was strictly professional, but the indictment portrayed it as “personal and intimate.”
Federal prosecutors allege that the two used the WhatsApp platform to exchange 15,000 messages, pictures and audio clips in an eight-month period. It wasn’t immediately clear when the messages were sent.
Prosecutors say Cantrell and Vappie also used the app to intimidate subordinates, harass a citizen, delete evidence, lie to colleagues and commit perjury for the purpose of distracting and impeding investigations into their actions.
Vappie accompanied Cantrell on 14 domestic and international trips to maximize their time together, federal prosecutors said.
For example, during a working trip to San Francisco in April 2022, the pair stayed an extra day to visit Napa Valley wineries and Vappie claimed to have worked 15 hours, prosecutors said.
In one text message, Cantrell characterized their moments together as “times when we are truly alone,” and as “what spoils me the most,” prosecutors said during Friday's news conference.
In total, New Orleans spent $70,000 for Vappie's trips while he was with Cantrell, prosecutors claimed.
They developed a personal and intimate relationship until Vappie retired in June 2024, they said.
New Orleans City Council President JP Morrell on Friday offered prayers for Cantrell and her family.
“This is a sad day for the people of New Orleans,"" Morrell said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Cantrell family as they navigate through this difficult time.""
Cantrell, a Democrat, is in her last term as mayor and is set to leave office in January.
She is the city's first female mayor in its 300-year history. Her second term has been turbulent, including surviving a recall effort in 2022.
Cantrell is the first mayor in the city's history to face federal charges while in office,NBC affiliate WDSU of New Orleans reported.
FormerMayor Ray Naginwassentenced to 10 years in prisonon bribery and other charges in 2014, after leaving office. The convictions related to crimes committed during his two terms. He was granted supervised release in 2020 because of the pandemic.

Swedenon Tuesday began two days of relocating one of its most famous wooden churches, moving the 113-year-old Kiruna Church about 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) down the road to a new city center to allow for the expansion of an underground iron ore mine.
The 672-ton Lutheran church, often voted Sweden's most beautiful building, was lifted onto a convoy of remote-controlled flatbed trailers.
At least 10,000 people are expected to be in attendance for this historic event in the town of 18,000 people to see the church chugging along at a pace of half-a-kilometer an hour.
Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustafwill be among the attendees to witness the slow march of the church.
The operation is part of a decadeslong project to move much of the Arctic town of Kiruna after mining weakened the ground beneath its historic center.
Mine operator LKAB is financing the relocation of the church estimated at 500 million kronor (€45 million, $52 million), for which it also had to get the roads widened to accommodate the church.
Broadcaster SVT will be streaming the slow-moving spectacle live, calling it ""The Great Church Walk,"" with Sweden's 2025Eurovision entry, KAJ, performing for the crowds.
""The church is Kiruna's soul in some way, and in some way it's a safe place,"" Lena Tjarnberg, the vicar of Kiruna, told Reuters news agency. ""For me, it's like a day of joy. But I think people also feel sad because we have to leave this place.""
Designed by Swedish architect Gustaf Wickman, the 40 meters (131 feet) tall structure includes designs inspired by the region's indigenous Sami people on the pews.
While the move has been celebrated as an awe-inspiring feat of engineering, the feelings are not the same for the Sami community, which has herded reindeer there for thousands of years.
They warn that the mine's further expansion threatenstraditional migration routesof the animal and fear this will imperil the livelihood of indigenous herders in the area.
Around 3,000 homes and about 6,000 people will need to move as part of the relocation, LKAB said.

BROOKLYN-Find the latest on the Brooklyn mass shooting here.
Three people are dead, and nine others injured after police say several gunmen opened fire inside a nightclub in Brooklyn early Sunday morning.
What we know:
Officers rushed to Franklin Avenue in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood for reports of a shooting inside the Taste of the City Lounge just before 3:30 a.m.
They arrived to find 12 gunshot victims: eight men and three women, ranging in age from 19 to 61 years old.
Three victims have been pronounced dead: a 19-year-old man, a 27-year-old man and a 35-year-old man.
The nine remaining victims were rushed to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries.
The latest news from NYC and beyond, plus the best of Good Day New York.
Police say up to four shooters with 9mm and 45-caliber weapons fired at least 42 shots inside the crowded club after a dispute.
The shooting appears to be gang-related, according to police, who say some of the victims were likely involved in the shooting.
What we don't know:
The names of the victims have yet to be released.
No one is currently in custody, and police have yet to release any possible suspect descriptions.
A firearm was found near Bedford Avenue and Easten Parkway, but police still don't know if it is connected to the lounge shooting.
An investigation is underway as police canvas surveillance video inside the lounge and around the area.
What they're saying:
""Gun violence of this magnitude really scars a city,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said during a press conference on Sunday.
The mayor asked for the public's help to find those responsible for what Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch called a ""tragic, senseless act of violence.""
Officials are asking anyone who was inside the club, heard people talking about the shooting, or saw people flee the scene, to contact the police.

Updated on:  August 15, 2025 / 10:31 AM EDT/ CBS New York
The building at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan was evacuated on Thursday afternoon following reports of an unknown white powder.
The FDNY said a call came in just before 4 p.m. saying the powder was reported found in the mailroom on the ninth floor of the building, which is home to the Department of Homeland Security and the New York City field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among other agencies. First responders and hazmat units were on the scene with four minutes, authorities said.
""Today's event was under control almost immediately, without incident,"" Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Kaz Daughtry said.
At an evening news conference, authorities said they were awaiting test results on the powder, which was in five separate letters, adding those letters would also be sent to FBI headquarters in Quantico, Virginia. They said at least two people were exposed.
Christopher Raia, the assistant director of the FBI's New York City field office, said, ""Weapons of Mass Destruction and Hazard Evidence response teams immediately responded to the scene. The building was evacuated as per standard protocol and right now no threat remains to any employees or the public at this time.""
DHS said in a statement, in part, that ""some individuals were sheltering in place as part of established safety protocols.""
Officials asked people to avoid the area as they continue to investigate.
On Friday, Mayor Eric Adams saidpreliminary testingfound no dangerous substance in the powder.
The building at 26 Federal Plaza has been the scene ofnumerous detainments by ICE agents following routine immigration hearings. It has also been the siteof several protests, alleging immigrants are being held in deplorable conditions.
DHS maintains the building is not a detention center and says allegations of overcrowding or poor conditions are ""categorically false.""
""It is a processing center where illegal aliens are briefly processed to be transferred to an ICE detention facility,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a recent statement to CBS News New York. ""All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. As we arrest and remove criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding.""
A federal judge on Tuesday saidhe would block the Trump administration from using the building to hold immigrants facing deportationunless it reduces the number of detainees and improves conditions at the site, including by providing sleeping mats and hygiene products.
U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplanissued the temporary restraining orderafter holding a hearing earlier Tuesday. A government lawyer conceded in court that those detained by ICE at the facility did not have access to certain services, including sleeping mats, in-person legal visits, medication and more than two meals per day.
Jeff Capellini has been digital producer at CBS New York for 18 years. He previously worked for The Associated Press and several newspapers.

LOGAN SQUARE — Chicagoans are uniting in the search for Bam Bam, a beloved 14-year-old dachshund who was stolen from his Logan Square backyard in June.
Angel Santiago, 58, who is legally blind and has glaucoma and Type 2 diabetes, has been on adesperate searchto find Bam Bam since he was taken from him. Since receivingample media coverageon his search within the last week, neighbors, local rescues and animal welfare groups have banded together to increase awareness of the missing pup.
While Bam Bam has still not been found, a team of neighbors and animal lovers have created an email tip line, afundraiser for search effortsand aFacebook pageto keep the community up to date and streamline the search on Santiago’s behalf. Awebsitewas also made with all the information in one spot, including a link todownload flyers.
They also helped Santiago file a police report this week, which he did not do at the time of the incident.
The group is organizing a flier canvassing event at 12 p.m. Saturday with two meeting places, one at the Logan Square Monument Park, 3150 W. Logan Blvd., and one at the southwest side of the Lincoln Park Passerelle, the arch pedestrian bridge in Lincoln Park that crosses Lake Shore Drive.
Those who wish to help are welcome to meet at one of the two starting points and will be asked to flyer various streets in Logan Square and Humboldt Park. The group and Santiago hope more people will help with flyer distribution in person and in local social media groups, and encourage people to share the flyer all over the city and suburbs.
The group decided to bring volunteers to Lincoln Park broaden the search for Bam Bam given the influx of visitors for the Air and Water show this weekend, said Amy Pasalich, one of six people co-organizing Saturday’s event.
“We are very hopeful that the more pressure we put on this, the more pressure from the community and the reward, that somebody will come forward,” Pasalich said. “I don’t want Angel doing this alone anymore. … This has truly just floored me. Animals are so important to all of us. If people put themselves in Angel’s shoes, [they’d know] how devastating this would feel.”
Pasalich, who also started thefundraiser, said Santiago and the group hope for Bam Bam’s safe return with no questions asked. They are not interested in pressing charges and are open to anonymous tips. Tips can be sent tobambamtipline@gmail.com.
The fundraiser quickly exceeded its financial goal after Pasalich launched it last week, raising nearly $16,000 as of Thursday afternoon. Money will be used to print flyers and to increase the reward amount if necessary.
As of now, the reward for Bam Bam’s safe return is $5,000,which is coming from PETA.
Some of those helping out also previously organized search parties forMinnie, the South Loop lab who escaped from her daycareearlier this year but has still not been found.
Santiago said he’s trying to stay positive and has been moved by the show of support within the last week. He is now working with a police detective, the alderman’s office and dozens of neighbors and animal groups to find Bam Bam.
He admits he didn’t want all the attention but is grateful for the help. He hopes the excess money raised from the fundraiser that isn’t used for search or reward efforts can be used to pay it forward for another blind person, he said.
“I just want my dog back,” Santiago said. “The money can help another blind person, maybe help them get a dog or other needs like a navigation walking stick, something that helps them through everyday lives, even like comfortable shoes.”

A quad bike, some tyres and cans of Sprite are among the belongings seen in the first photos released of inside the campsite where fugitive Tom Phillips and his children had recently been staying in.
Phillips died after a shootout with policeafter they were called to reports of a burglary in the early hours of Monday. A police officer was shot multiple times in the head during the shootout and remains in hospital with significant injuries which police have described as ""survivable"".
One of Phillips' children, who was with him at the time, then began assisting police and said there were firearms at the campsite.
More than 12 hours later the remaining children were located in a remote campsite, deep in dense bush about 2km away from where Phillips was fatally shot.
Police Commissioner Richard Chambers said Phillips and his children had been at the campsite for a little while and there had been some ""structures"" created.
On Tuesday, police released photos of the campsite.

The photos show a motorbike and a quad bike covered by what appears to be netting in dense bush, some tyres and cans of Sprite.
There also appears to be a gas canister.
Speaking to media on Tuesday afternoon, Chambers told media police were able to get support from one of the children on Monday to better understand where the other children may be located.
Chambers said the photos provided to the media demonstrated the ""challenging environment"" they were operating in.
""Whilst what you see in dense bush might suggest they've been there for some time, what we know is over the last four years Mr Phillips and his children have been very mobile… that's been a real challenge for us to deal with.""
Police had been told there was likely to be at least one firearm and ammunition at the campsite. So far, police had located one firearm.

He said the children were ""skilled"" in the environment they were in and police had to ensure no-one was harmed.
Chambers earlier toldMorning Reporthe was very relieved the children had been recovered safely.
He said the children have a ""long road to recovery"", but he had comfort in knowing they're now being supported.
The children had been checked by health professionals and were doing well, Chambers confirmed.
Police had about 50 staff searching the bush including Special Tactics Group (STG) and the Armed Offenders Squad (AOS) on Monday for the children.

Deputy Commissioner Jill Rogers told media on Monday evening the children were by themselves at a ""very remote"" campsite.
""It's taken our staff some time to walk into it this morning, following information that we were provided earlier in the day.""
Rogers said information provided by one of Phillips' children earlier in the morning was ""crucial in narrowing our search boundaries"".
""We've come across them in the area that we were identified as being a probable location in which we could find them, and we've had communication with them, and we've safely engaged with them, and they're now with our police officers.""
About 2.30 on Monday morning police received a call from a Piopio resident to say they believed they were witnessing a burglary in action at PGG Wrightson.
The burglary involved two people on a quad bike dressed in farm clothing and wearing headlamps.
""Knowing the information that we had previously had that had seen Tom Phillips also in this area, additional staff were called out and responded to that location,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Jill Rogers earlier told media.
A quad bike was seen leaving the area along the Waipuna Road, a gravel road that intersects with Te Anga Road, the main road leading back to Marokopa.
A constable then decided to lay road spikes at the intersection about 3.20am.
The quad bike then ran over the spikes, with the bike coming to a rest a short time later.
The constable, who was first on the scene, came across the bike and was confronted by gunfire at close range and was shot in the head multiple times.
""He was getting out of the vehicle and has fallen to the ground. He's taken cover back in the vehicle,"" Rogers said.
A second patrol car then arrived and ""engaged"" Phillips who was shot and died at the scene.
One of Phillips' children was then taken into custody uninjured.
The officer was then flown to Waikato Hospital by the Westpac Rescue in a critical condition.
Once he arrived in hospital he was conscious and was able to speak to some of his colleagues.

According toLe Dauphiné Libéré, the young man was found tied up in a house near Valence train station. According to the regional daily, the tactical unit also intervened in a Valence snack bar on Tuesday.

In recent months, there have been a number of kidnappings and attempted kidnappings linked to the cryptocurrency world. The series of kidnappings began in early January, when a 56-year-old man was found in the boot of a car near Le Mans, several hundred kilometres from his home in the Ain region of France.
According to several media reports, the man was the father of a Dubai-based cryptocurrency influencer who regularly posts videos of his earnings.
Then, at the end of January, Ledger co-founder David Balland and his partner were kidnapped from their home in Cher. Balland, who had his finger cut off, was freed during a police operation and his companion was found tied up in a vehicle.

In Paris on May 1, in the 14th arrondissement, the father of a man running a company specialising in cryptocurrencies based in Malta was abducted by four hooded men.
The victim, whose finger was cut off by the kidnappers and for whom a ransom of several million euros was demanded, was freed 58 hours later during an assault by the BRI (search and intervention brigade) on a house in Essonne.
A few days later, on May 13, a video that went viral captured the attempted kidnapping of the daughter and grandson of the CEO of the cryptocurrency company Paymium.
In each of these cases, which are ongoing, several suspects have been arrested, indicted and remanded in custody.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/fox-news-newsmax-antitrust-lawsuit.html,t3_1n7lrev,Newsmax filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing conservative media giant Fox News of acting as a monopoly and suppressing its right-leaning competitors,NewSlinger,2025-09-03 17:49:46,7092,238,N/A,N/A,N/A,"In this article
Newsmaxfiled a lawsuit Wednesday accusingconservativemedia giantFox Newsof acting as amonopolyand suppressing its right-leaning competitors.
""Fox has sought to protect and expand its monopoly power in the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market by engaging in a suite of anticompetitive behaviors,"" attorneys for the outletwrote in the suit infederal court in southern Florida.
The lawyers allege that Fox News coerces distributors into ""exclusionary and restrictive agreements,"" and that it has used ""intimidation tactics"" to hurt Newsmax — including hiring ""private detective firms to investigate Newsmax executives.""
""But for Fox's anticompetitive behavior, Newsmax would have achieved greater pay TV distribution, seen its audience and ratings grow sooner, gained earlier 'critical mass' for major advertisers and become, overall, a more valuable media property,"" they wrote in the suit.
A Fox News spokesperson curtly replied, ""Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.""
In a phone interview with CNBC later Wednesday, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy shot back, ""Then why did they spend so much time throughout the years blocking and suppressing us?""
Ruddy is a former reporter for the New York Post, the tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate who created Fox News.
""Fox may have profited from exclusionary contracts and intimidation tactics for years, but those days are over,"" Ruddysaid in a separate statement.
Newsmax wants a judge to issue a permanent injunction barring Fox's allegedly exclusionary agreements.
It also seeks a judgment for three times the amount of damages that it has allegedly sustained by Fox, as well as pre- and post-judgment interest ""at the highest legal rate.""
Ruddy told CNBC that Newsmax believes the total damages figure will be ""significant and serious.""
The suit alleges that Fox, which has long been the most-watched cable news network on television, uses multiple strategies to ""coerce distributors into not carrying or into marginalizing other right-leaning news channels.""
Fox either explicitly or tacitly makes access to its content conditional on distributors agreeing not to carry those channels, the suit alleges.
If they do, Fox imposes financial penalties on those distributors, by requiring them ""to carry and pay high fees for Fox's little-watched channels like Fox Business,"" according to Newsmax.
Fox also allegedly ""inserts a suite of other contractual barriers into its carriage agreements intended to prevent Newsmax and others from competing.""
""These tactics constitute unlawful restraints of trade and flow directly from Fox's unlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market,"" the suit alleges.
""Fox's longstanding and ongoing practices have harmed and will further harm, competition and consumers in the United States.""
The antitrust complaint is the latest legal headache for Fox News, which has been the target of multiple high-profile and pricey lawsuits in recent years.
In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay over$787 millionto settle a defamation suit over false claims said on its air about Dominion Voting Systems rigging the 2020 presidential election. In August, Newsmax also agreed to pay$67 millionto settle similar defamation claims.
A similar suit filed by another voting machine company, Smartmatic, is currently headed for trial. Smartmatic is seeking $2.7 billion.
Newsmax, meanwhile, earliersettled a similar lawsuitand paid $40 million to Smartmatic.

An Oklahoma man was arrested and charged with child sexual abuse after his 11-year-old stepdaughter gave birth at their home in Muskogee.
Dustin Walker, 34, and Cherie Walker, 33, were arrested last week and originally charged with one count of felony child neglect each after the child gave birth to a full-term baby at home on Aug. 16, court records show. The parents initially claimed they did not know the child was pregnant, and the child had not been to the doctor in over a year.
The charges were amended Mondayafter DNA test results revealed that the stepfather was a 99.9% DNA match for the baby's father, according to the test, which the Muskogee County District Attorney's Office shared with NBC News.
Dustin Walker is accused of sexually abusing the girl, who was 11 years old at the time, on or between Jan. 1 to Aug. 16, resulting in her giving birth to his child, court documents show. Her mother, Cherie Walker, was charged with enabling child sexual abuse.
""This is one of the most if not the most serious child sexual abuse and neglect cases I have ever prosecuted,"" Muskogee County Assistant District Attorney Janet Hutson said in a statement.
The couple were also charged with six counts of felony child neglect, including failing to provide the 11-year-old with adequate medical care and supervision when she gave birth at home, according to court documents. The remaining five counts of child neglect allege neglect of the five children they share, ages 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9, on or between Jan. 1 and Aug. 16. The children were ""living in deplorable conditions,"" according to the documents.
The children were removed from the home Tuesday, according to court records.
""The victims were found to be living in dog feces and had no clothing on,"" court documents say.
Bond was set at $100,000 each, according to court records. A sounding docket court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 3.
""Each of the charges against both defendants are punishable by up to life,"" Hutson said.
It is not clear whether Dustin and Cherie Walker are being represented by attorneys.

Cardi B says she will counter sue the next person who attempts to file a false lawsuit against her. The rap star was cleared of assault charges Tuesday.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — A jury gaveCardi B a quick and absolute victoryTuesday at a trial in the lawsuit of a security guard who alleged the rap star assaulted her at a doctor’s office during her then-secret first pregnancy.
The jury of six men and six women at a small courthouse in Alhambra, California deliberated for only about an hour before findingCardinot liable in the lawsuit brought by Emani Ellis, who alleged Cardi cut her face with a fingernail and spat on her in the hallway of a Beverly Hills obstetrician in February of 2018.
Only nine of the 12 jurors were required for a verdict in the civil case, but their decision in Cardi’s favor was unanimous.
“The next person who tries to do a frivolous lawsuit against me, I’m going to counter-sue, and I’m gonna make you pay, because this is not OK,” she said outside the courthouse, where she posed for pictures with fans. “I am not that celeb that you sue, and you think is going to settle. I’m not gonna settle. Especially when I’m super completely innocent.”
She said she had to miss her kids’ first day of school because of the trial, and said her forehead was “raw, raw, raw” after all the elaborate wig changes during the trial that at one point even left her lawyer confused over which was her real hair. (None of them were, she said with a laugh.)
During a lunchbreak before the verdict Tuesday in a moment captured by cameras from several media outlets, she threw a marker she was using for autographs at a man who shouted questions to her about whether she was currently pregnant, and who the father is. She called the questions disrespectful.
In two days of testimony last week that were livestreamed, widely viewed and full of viral moments, the hip-hop star testified she feared that Ellis was going to make her pregnancy public. She acknowledged that the two argued, but said it never got physical.
“I will say it on my deathbed. I did not touch that woman,” she said after her win. “I did not touch that girl. I didn’t lay my hands on that girl.”
Ron Rosen Janfaza, the lawyer for the plaintiff Ellis, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. He said outside court that they plan to appeal the decision.
After several days off, the trial resumed with closing arguments earlier Tuesday.
Janfaza told jurors that Ellis, who had hoped to work in law enforcement or something similar, “lost her future” along with her job over the incident.
“Whether it’s the FBI, police, attorney, whatever she wanted to do, this incident cut it off,” he said in his closing argument. “No more, because of the trauma she sustained.”
He also called out the profanity Cardi freely used during her testimony, suggesting she had scorn for the proceedings.
“The defendant came here, used all of this foul language,” he told the jurors. “This is a court of law, you cannot speak this way in court. I have never seen this before.”
Cardi testified that she had been visiting Los Angeles doing promotional work in February 2018 around that year’s NBA All-Star Game. She was four months into her pregnancy with the first of herthree children with rapper Offset. She had told her inner circle she was having a baby, but not the public or her parents.
The obstetrician’s office had been closed to other patients on a Saturday for her privacy.
She said Ellis, a security guard for the building, followed her to her fifth-floor appointment. Cardi told jurors last week that she heard Ellis say her name into a phone and appeared to be filming her.
“I told her, ‘Why are you recording?’” Cardi testified, “and she said, ’Oh my bad.’ She practically apologized.’”
But the argument grew increasingly heated, she said.
“As we were arguing she’s backing me, she’s walking into me,” Cardi said.
Ellis testified that the incident left her humiliated and traumatized, and the scar on her face required cosmetic surgery. Ellis, who lost her job over the incident, sought damages that include medical expenses, compensation for emotional and physical suffering, and lost wages, along with punitive damages. She does not specify a total amount in the lawsuit but Cardi said from the stand that she is “suing me for $24 million.”
A receptionist who broke up the argument between Cardi and Ellis largely backed the rapper’s account in testimony.

KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Seven migrants were transferred from the United States toRwandain August under a deportation agreement with the U.S., authorities in the East African country said Thursday.
Rwanda said earlier in August it would accept up to 250 deportees from the U.S.
Yolande Makolo, a spokeswoman for the Rwandan government, said in a statement that the “first group of seven vetted migrants arrived in Rwanda in mid-August.”
Rwanda is one of four African countries that have reached deportation agreements with Washington, The others are Uganda, Eswatini andSouth Sudan.
No information was provided about the identities of the deportees sent to Rwanda this month.
They have been “accommodated by an international organization” with visits by the International Organization for Migration, as well as representatives of Rwandan social services, Makolo said.
“Three of the individuals have expressed a desire to return to their home countries, while four wish to stay and build lives in Rwanda,” Makolo said.
In addition to accommodation, those approved for settlement in Rwanda will receive workforce training and health care, she said.
The Trump administration has come under scrutiny for the African countries it has entered into secretive deals with to take deportees. It sent eight men from South Sudan, Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnamto South Sudan in early Julyafter a U.S. Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for their deportations.
The U.S. also deported five men who are citizens of Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos tothe southern African kingdom of Eswatini, where the government said they will be held in solitary confinement in prison for an undetermined period of time.
Uganda has also agreed to a deal with the U.S. to take deported migrants as long as they don’t have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors. U.S. officials have said they want to deportKilmar Abrego Garcia, a high-profile detainee, to Uganda.

The Department of Government Efficiency put the personal data of millions of Americans, including Social Security numbers, on a vulnerable server in June, according to a new whistleblower complaint.
The report, filed by the chief data officer for the Social Security Administration (SSA), Charles Borges, alleges that the actions of multiple DOGE staffers “constitute violations of laws, rules, and regulations, abuse of authority, gross mismanagement and creation of a substantial and specific threat to public health and safety.”
Borges' complaint accuses SSA Chief Information Officer Aram Moghaddassi, a longtime ally of Elon Musk, of violating agency policies to “create a live copy of the country’s Social Security information in a cloud environment that circumvents oversight,” in violation of multiple federal statutes.
The file contains identifying information of more than 300 million Americans, according to the complaint, including records of all Social Security Numbers issued by the federal government and sensitive details required to apply for one — making it a gold mine for potential nefarious actors.
“Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital healthcare and food benefits, and the government may be responsible for re-issuing every American new Social Security Number at great cost,” Borges wrote in his complaint, which established escalating violations of federal law.
DOGE staffers were given “improper and excessive access” to multiple databases with sensitive information in March, the complaint says. A federal judge blocked them from accessing SSA data that month, but the Supreme Court overturned that ruling in June.
Following the high court’s ruling, DOGE staffers requested to move the SSA's database, known as ""Numident,"" to a private cloud server that only DOGE personnel could access “without any independent security or oversight mechanisms in place in violation of laws and creating enormous vulnerabilities,"" the complaint said.
Numident (numerical identification system) contains Social Security numbers as well as an individual's name, address, place of birth, their parents’ names and other personal data.
An official agency security assessment at the time, which is cited in the complaint, described copying the database to the server as “high-risk” given that “most security exposures and breaches occur within development environments due to reduced control measures and oversight.” The assessment warned of “catastrophic impact” to Social Security beneficiaries and programs if the database were breached.
“I have determined the business need is higher than the security risk associated with this implementation and I accept all risks,” Moghaddassi wrote in a July 15 memo, the complaint says.
Social Security Administration spokesperson Nick Perrine said the agency takes all whistleblower complaints seriously and maintained that the data referred to in the complaint is ""walled off from the internet""and accessible to high-level career officials with proper oversight.
“We are not aware of any compromise to this environment and remain dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data,” Perrine said in a statement.

Warning: This article contains distressing content
A funeral director has been banned from NHS maternity wards and mortuaries in Leeds after keeping babies' bodies at her home, a BBC investigation has revealed.
Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust said it had barred 38-year-old Amie Upton from its mortuaries and maternity wards in spring this year.
One mother said she had been left ""screaming"" after discovering her dead son had been put in a baby bouncer ""watching cartoons"" in Ms Upton's living room.
Ms Upton said she had only ever had two complaints in her eight years of running her baby loss support and funeral service, Florrie's Army.
Zoe Ward's baby, Bleu, was three weeks old when he died of brain damage at Leeds General Infirmary in 2021.
Ms Ward, 32, asked Florrie's Army to arrange his funeral, after a recommendation from a family friend.
She said she had spoken to Ms Upton and thought the service sounded ""brilliant"".
Florrie's Army said it supports bereaved parents, offering free handprints, photographs, baby clothing and a dedicated funeral service.
According to her posts on Facebook, Ms Upton set up the group after her own daughter was stillborn in 2017.
Ms Ward said Bleu's body had been picked up from the hospital by someone on behalf of Florrie's Army.
She said she had thought he would be in a ""professional setting"".
But when she went round to visit the next day, Ms Ward was ""terrified"" to see Ms Upton ""watching"" cartoons with her son's body next to her in a baby bouncer in the living room.
""I realised it were Bleu and she [Ms Upton] says: 'Come in, we're watching PJ Masks.'
""There's a cat scratcher in the corner and I can hear a dog barking and there was another [dead] baby on the sofa. It wasn't a nice sight.
""I rang my mum and I'm saying, 'This ain't right'â¦ I was screaming down the phone [saying]: 'It's mucky, it's dirty, he can't stay here.'""

Ms Ward's mother then arranged for another funeral director to collect Bleu's body and he was removed from Ms Upton's care.
""I didn't want him in that house,"" Ms Ward said, adding the ""weird"" experience had left her ""upset and angry"".
LISTEN: 'Funeral director kept my baby's body at home'
The funeral industry is unregulated in England and Wales. There are no legal requirements about how and where bodies should be stored, and no qualifications are needed to set up as a funeral director.
The two main trade organisations - the National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) and the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors (SAIF) â have a joint code of conduct, which says members must undergo regular inspections of their premises and procedures.
Best practice suggests bodies should be kept in a clean and clinical environment, between 4-7Â°C.
However, membership is voluntary and Ms Upton is not a member of either organisation.
Zoe Ward said her son's body was in unsuitable conditions at Amie Upton's ""mucky, dirty"" home
Sharon and Paul (not their real names) were introduced to Ms Upton through a family friend after their daughter was stillborn at another Leeds hospital, St James', earlier this year.
They said they had agreed to their daughter being taken by Florrie's Army, as Ms Upton had led them to believe the body was being kept at a funeral parlour in Headingley until the burial.
But they said more than a week later, Ms Upton had told them their daughter was at her house - five miles away from where they had expected her to be. They said they had not given their consent for her to be taken there.
""I just didn't know why she was there,"" said Sharon.
The couple do not know how long their daughter's body had been at Ms Upton's, but Sharon believes it had not been kept at the correct temperature, saying it was ""really smelly, like she'd been in there and not kept cool"".
The BBC understands Ms Upton has a cold cot - with electrical cooling pads to maintain lower temperatures - which she uses at her home and lends out to families.
However, the BBC has seen evidence indicating that bodies under Ms Upton's care have not always been kept in the cold cot.
Sharon and Paul said as soon as they had realised their baby was in Ms Upton's house, they drove across Leeds to bring her home and transfer her to another funeral director.
Sharon's mother said: ""It was just crazy. If I told somebody of this story... they'd think it was a horror film.""
Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust said it only allowed bodies to be signed out of its mortuaries by authorised funeral directors.
Both Ms Ward and Sharon and Paul's babies were signed out by Philip Gallagher of Gallagher Funeral Services, in Headingley â one of the Trust's authorised funeral directors.
Mr Gallagher said he had had a ""working relationship"" with Ms Upton for five years, including ""providing funerals for people's loved ones that have sadly passed away"".
""We are aware that two families have raised concerns about the service she provides; however, it is our understanding that these concerns have been thoroughly investigated,"" he added.
Mr Gallagher, whose business is not a member of NAFD or SAIF, did not respond to questions about how or why Sharon and Paul's baby's body had been moved from his Headingley parlour to Ms Upton's house.
Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust said it had received ""several serious concerns"" about Ms Upton's services over the past few years.
It said Florrie's Army was not endorsed by or associated with its hospitals and it had raised its concerns about Ms Upton's activities with the police, external safeguarding services, relevant regulators and the coroner's office.
""When we first became aware of concerns, we implemented extra steps in our mortuary services on top of our already robust measures,"" it said.
""Since 2021 we have had specific safeguarding measures in place, including monitoring [Ms Upton's] attendance when visiting deceased patients at the mortuary in her funeral service role.""
The Trust added it had ""strengthened"" its actions against Ms Upton earlier this year and she was no longer allowed in their mortuaries, or on their maternity wards ""unless as a patient herself"".
Amie Upton said she had only had two complaints in eight years of service
West Yorkshire Police confirmed it had investigated two reports about Ms Upton's funeral service since 2021, but said after ""extensive enquiries... no potential crimes were identified"".
A spokesperson added: ""We recognise the concerns raised by these two families will have added to the distress they felt during an already incredibly difficult time. Our thoughts remain with them.""
The BBC asked Ms Upton to respond to claims her home was an unsuitable place to keep babies' bodies, including why pets were allowed near the bodies, and asked for confirmation as to whether she had moved bodies from Mr Gallagher's funeral parlour without parents' consent.
Ms Upton did not respond to the claims but said she had only had two complaints in the eight years since she set up Florrie's Army.
Many reviews of her services on Facebook are positive, with some families describing the service as ""amazing"" and ""inspirational"".
If you, or someone you know, have been affected by child bereavement, support is available via theBBC Action Line
Funeral director George Roberts, from SAIF, said bereaved families deserved a professional service and needed to know they were in ""safe hands"".
Mr Roberts, whose family has been in the business in Scarborough for 40 years, said it was ""wrong"" that funeral directors did not need to be qualified.
""[Anyone] could easily go online, design business cards, get them printed and put them through neighbour's doors and sit back and wait for the phone to ring,"" he said.
A statutory code of conduct for funeral directors,externalwas introduced in Scotland in March.
The government is yet to respond to a recommendation given by an inquiry in July, which said it should introduce statutory regulations in England.
But in response to our findings, a government spokesperson said: ""Our thoughts remain with the grieving families affected by this awful situation. They rightly expected their children to be treated with dignity and respect.
""We are committed to taking action to ensure the highest standards are always met by funeral directors and are now considering the full range of options to improve standards.""

(KTTC) – The Rochester City Attorney’s Office moves to leverage three counts of Disorderly Conduct against Shiloh Hendrix, a woman who used racial slurs against a Somali child with a disability in asince-viral videoin April.
The charges would amount to a maximum of 90 days in jail and/or a $1,000 fine.
The legal complaint is still subject to review and approval by a district court judge, but it concludes that “[Shiloh] wrongfully and unlawfully engaged in offensive, obscene, abusive, boisterous, or noisy conduct, or in offensive obscene, or abusive language that would reasonably tend to arouse alarm, anger, or resentment in others.”
This matter involved a large amount of evidence and required careful consideration of potential charging options across multiple offices. Additionally, under Minnesota law, prosecutors are required to involve and consider the perspective of the crime victim. Given the sensitive and complicated nature of this case, along with the high level of public attention, completing the necessary reviews and conversations with the victim’s family took longer than usual.
The City Attorney’s Office remains focused on the legal process and is committed to ensuring a fair process. We will not speculate on the length of the court process or the potential outcome.
“This was a situation that deeply affected many people, especially our communities of color, and caused real turmoil in our community,” shared Mayor Kim Norton. “We acknowledge the lasting impact this incident has had, not only on those directly involved and across our community, but also in the broader conversations happening at the state and national level. These moments remind us of the complexity and far-reaching impacts of situations like this. The City remains committed to staying engaged and proceeding with transparency and care, continuing efforts that support accountability and progress in Rochester.”

A fire has destroyed the national parliament building of theMarshall Islands, according to officials in the Pacific Island nation.
The Marshall Islands fire department said half of the parliament building – known as the Nitijela – had been burnt down, in an interview with Reuters.
Firefighters were called to the scene in the early hours of Tuesday morning when the building was already engulfed. They successfully stopped the blaze, but police officials told Reuters the remaining structure cannot be used.
RNZ reportedthe parliament chamber, offices, library and archives had all been destroyed.
“The building is no longer usable, and already, alternative plans are being talked about, about where they’re going to hold parliament, because parliament is actually in session right now,” RNZ Pacific’s correspondent in the Marshall Islands Giff Johnson said.
The Pacific archipelago, midway between Hawaii and Australia, has a population of about 42,000, with half living in the capital Majuro.
The nation’s major diplomatic relationships are a compact of free association with the United States, which provides economic assistance in return for military access, and diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.
The Marshall Islands parliament and president Hilda Heine’s spokesperson did not immediately respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment.
Taiwan’s foreign minister Lin Chia-lung expressed his condolences.
Taiwan will remain in communication with the Marshall Islands’ government and “provide necessary assistance in a timely manner“, the ministry added in a statement, without elaborating."

A Rhode Island prosecutor told police ""you're going to regret this"" during a confrontation that ended in her arrest, which was caught on an officer's body camera, officials said Tuesday.
Special Assistant Attorney General Devon Hogan Flanagan and a friend had been asked to leave Clarke Cooke House in Newport when officers arrived, police video showed.
“I want you to turn your bodycam off,"" Hogan Flanagan immediately tells the officers. ""Protocol is that you turn it off. It’s a citizen request that you turn it off.”
At numerous points of the video, police tell Hogan Flanagan and her friend, Veronica Hannan, that the confrontation would be over if they just left the Bannister’s Wharf restaurant.
“Let’s go. I don’t want to arrest you guys” for alleged trespassing, an officer behind the camera says.
""You’re not going to arrest us,"" Hogan Flanagan responds.
“So let’s leave. We got to go. We got to go,” the officer replies.
The women stood their ground outside the restaurant and would not leave.
It wasn't clear in the video what sparked the women’s conflict with the restaurant or why they insisted on staying. An officer can be heard on camera asking a restaurant employee: “Do you just want them out? Do you want them trespassed?”
“Anything we can do. Trespass, yes,” the employee said.
Hogan Flanagan and Hannan kept reminding officers throughout the encounter that she's a lawyer. ""I'm an AG, I'm an AG,""  Hogan Flanagan said.
The two women were eventually handcuffed as Flanagan told police: “You’re going to regret this!""
She continued to say, ""I'm an AG.""
As Hogan Flanagan was loaded into the back of a police car in handcuffs, she said one more time, ""I'm an A,"" when the door slammed and cut her off before she could get out a final ""G.""
The state attorney general's office identified Hogan Flanagan as a special assistant attorney general who has been on the job for seven years and is assigned to the Criminal Division's Appellate Unit.
State prosecutors are still reviewing the incident.
""At this time, we are unable to comment further on this matter as it relates to personnel issues,"" AG’s spokesperson Timothy Rondeau said in statement Tuesday.
Hogan Flanagan was charged with willful trespass and given a summons to appear in court, police said.
Hannan was charged with willful trespass, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, police said.
Bodycam video showed Hannan briefly slipping out of handcuffs during the confrontation and repeatedly kicking the door of police vehicle as officers tried to arrest her.
Hogan Flanagan and Hannan did not immediately reply to calls seeking comment Tuesday.

DENVER (AP) — The conservative network Newsmax will pay $67 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of defaming a voting equipment company by spreading lies about PresidentDonald Trump’s2020 election loss, according to documents filed Monday.
The settlement comes after Fox News Channelpaid $787.5 millionto settle a similar lawsuit in 2023 and Newsmax paid what court papers describe as $40 million tosettle a libel lawsuitfrom a different voting machine manufacturer, Smartmatic, which also wasa targetof pro-Trump conspiracy theories on the network.
Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had ruled earlier that Newsmax did indeed defame Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems by airing false information about the company and its equipment. But Davis left it to a jury to eventually decide whether that was done with malice, and, if so, how much Dominion deserved from Newsmax in damages. Newsmax and Dominion reached the settlement before the trial could take place.
The settlement was disclosed by Newsmax in a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It said the deal was reached Friday.
“Newsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020,” the company said in a statement. “We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced, and conducted within professional standards of journalism.”
A spokesperson for Dominion said the company was pleased to have settled the lawsuit.
The disclosure of the settlement came as Trump, wholost his 2020 reelection bidto Democrat Joe Biden, vowed in a social media post Monday to eliminate mail-in ballots and voting machines such as those supplied by Dominion and other companies. It was unclear how the Republican president could achieve that.
The same judge also handled the Dominion-Fox News case and made a similar ruling that the network repeatednumerous liesby Trump’s allies about his 2020 loss despiteinternal communicationsshowing Fox officials knew the claimswere bogus. At the time, Davis found it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations was true.
Internal correspondence from Newsmax officials likewise shows they knew the claims were baseless.
“How long are we going to play along with election fraud?” Newsmax host Bob Sellers said two days after the 2020 election wascalled for Biden, according to internal documents revealed as part of the case.
Newsmax took pride that it was not calling the election for Biden and, the internal documents show, saw a business opportunity in catering to viewers who believed Trump won. Private communications that surfaced as part of Dominion’s earlier defamation case against Fox Newsalso revealedhow the network’s business interests intersected with decisions it made related to coverage ofTrump’s 2020 election claims.
At Newsmax, employees repeatedly warned against false allegations from pro-Trump guests such as attorneySidney Powell, according to documents in the lawsuit. In one text, even Newsmax owner Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally, said he found it “scary” that Trump was meeting with Powell.
Dominion was at the heart of many of the wild claims aired by guests on Newsmax and elsewhere, who promoted a conspiracy theory involving deceased Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez to rig the machines for Biden. The networkretracted some of the more bombastic allegationsin December 2020.
Though Trump has insistedhis fraud claimsare real, there’s no evidence they were, and the lawsuits in the Fox and Newsmax cases show how some of the president’s biggest supporters knew they were false at the time. Trump’s then-attorney general, William Barr, said there wasno evidenceof widespread fraud.
Trump and his backers lostdozens of lawsuitsalleging fraud, some before Trump-appointed judges. Numerousrecounts,reviewsandauditsof the election results, includingsome run by Republicans, turned up no signs of significant wrongdoing or error and affirmed Biden’s win.
After returning to office, Trumppardonedthose who tried to halt the transfer of power during theJan. 6, 2021, attackon the U.S. Capitol anddirectedhis Department of Justice to investigate Chris Krebs, a former Trump cybersecurity appointee who hadvouched for the security and accuracyof the 2020 election.
As an initial trial date approached in the Dominion case earlier this year, Trump issued anexecutive orderattacking the law firm that litigated it and the Fox case, Susman Godfrey. The order, part of a seriestargeting law firmsTrump has tussled with, cited Susman Godfrey’s work on elections and said the government would not do business with any of its clients or permit any of its staff in federal buildings.
A federal judge put that action on hold, saying the framers would view it as“a shocking abuse of power.”

Explosions at a U.S. Steel plant that shook the ground near Pittsburgh left one dead and sent at least 10 to hospitals Monday, with emergency workers still searching the badly charred rubble hours later for a missing worker, officials said.
CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) — An explosion at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh left two dead and sent at least 10 to hospitals Monday and heavily damaged the sprawling facility, officials said.
One worker was found alive in the wreckage hours after the explosion sent black smoke spiraling into the midday sky in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel for more than a century. Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant started around 10:51 a.m.

The explosion, followed by several smaller blasts, could be felt in the nearby community and prompted county officials to warn residents to stay away from the scene so emergency workers could respond.
“It felt like thunder,” Zachary Buday, a construction worker near the scene, toldWTAE-TV. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building, and then when we saw the dark smoke coming up from the steel mill and put two and two together, and it’s like something bad happened.”

At a news conference, Scott Buckiso, U.S. Steel’s chief manufacturing officer, did not give details about the damage or casualties, and said they were still trying to determine what happened. U.S. Steel employees “did a great job” of going in and rescuing workers, shutting down gases and making sure the site was stable.
Buckiso said the company, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp., is working with authorities
U.S. Steel CEO David B. Burritt said the company would thoroughly investigate the cause.
“I end every meeting and every message with the words, ‘Let’s get back to work safely.’ That commitment has never been more important, and we will honor it,” he said in a statement.
Allegheny Health Network said it treated seven patients from the plant, and discharged five within a few hours. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it is treating three patients at UPMC Mercy, the region’s only level one trauma and burn center.
Clairton resident Amy Sowers was sitting on her porch, located less than a mile from the plant, and felt her house shake from the blast.
“I could see smoke from my driveway,” she said. “We heard ambulances and fire trucks from every direction.”
Sowers, 49, decided to leave the area after she said she smelled a faint smell in the air. Sowers, who grew up in Clairton, has seen several incidents at the plant over the years. Despite health concerns, Sowers said many residents cannot afford to leave.
A maintenance worker was killed in an explosion at the plant in September 2009. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. According to online OSHA records of workplace fatalities, the last death at the plant was in 2014, when a worker was burned and died after falling into a trench.
After the 2010 explosion, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined U.S. Steel and a subcontractor $175,000 for safety violations. U.S. Steel appealed its citations and $143,500 in fines, which were later reduced under a settlement agreement.
“Lives were lost again,” Sowers said. “How many more lives are going to have to be lost until something happens?”
The Clairton coking plant continued to operate after the explosion, although two batteries that were the site of the explosion were shut down, officials said.
The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania.

The plant converts coal to coke, a key component in the steel-making process. To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what’s known as coke gas — made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
Clairton Mayor Richard Lattanzi said his heart goes out to the victims of Monday’s explosion.
“The mill is such a big part of Clairton,” he said. “It’s just a sad day for Clairton.”
The Allegheny County Health Department said it lifted an advisory it issued earlier in the day telling residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors and close all windows and doors. It said its monitors have not detected levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.
According to the company, the plant has approximately 1,400 workers.
In recent years, the Clairton plant has been dogged by concerns about pollution.
In 2019, it agreed to settle an air pollution lawsuit for $8.5 million. Five years later, the company agreed to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs as part of settling a federal lawsuit filed by Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department.
The lawsuit stemmed from a Christmas Eve fire in 2018 that caused $40 million in damage. The fire damaged pollution control equipment and led to repeated releases of sulfur dioxide, according to a lawsuit. In the wake of the fire, Allegheny County warned residents to limit outdoor activities, with residents saying for weeks afterward that the air felt acidic, smelled like rotten eggs and was hard to breathe.
Dr. Deborah Gentile, the medical director of Community Partners in Asthma Care, studied asthma levels after the fire and found twice as many patients sought medical treatment. One of her colleagues found patients living near the plant had increased symptoms of asthma, including coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.
News of the latest explosion had Gentile questioning how well the facility was being maintained.
“I’m very concerned that they aren’t keeping their equipment up to date and in shape,” she said.
In February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, causing an audible “boom,” officials said. Two workers received first aid treatment at a local hospital but were not seriously injured.

David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, an environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.”
In June,U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announcedthey had finalized a “historic partnership,” a deal that gives the U.S. government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15 billion buyout of the iconic American steelmaker.
The pursuit byNippon Steelfor the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns andpresidential politicsin a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it.

While gifts worth less than $100 will remain duty-free, the changes mean all other packages will face the same tariff rate as other goods from their country of origin.
Postal services, including Royal Mail and Germany's DHL, said they would suspend deliveries until they had proper systems in place to deal with the new rules.
Royal Mail said it was withdrawing its current US export services for businesses from Tuesday, but added it hoped to have a new system up and running within two days to allow it to comply with the new rules before they kick in.
""We have been working hard with US authorities and international partners to adapt our services to meet the new US de minimis requirements so UK consumers and businesses can continue to use our services when they come into effect,"" the company said.
Royal Mail said cards and letters could continued to be posted as usual.
The US had a so-called de minimis exemption on packages worth up to $800, which allowed consumers to buy cheap clothing and household goods from sites such as Shein and Temu without paying import duties.
But the duty-free rule on Chinese goods ended on 2 May, and is now being extended to the rest of the word.
The White House said ending the duty-free exemption would combat ""escalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention"", claiming some shippers had ""abused"" the exemption to send illicit drugs into the US.
The Trump administration said de minimis shipments had skyrocketed from 115 million in the 2023/24 financial year, to 309 million by 30 June this year.
While China is a major source of shipments that use the exemption, Canada and Mexico are also significant sources of low-cost parcels being sent to the US.
Deutsche Post and DHL Parcel Germany said it was temporarily suspending parcel delivery for business customers to the US from Saturday, as ""key questions remain unresolved"" about how duties would be paid, and by whom.
DHL sad it was ""closely monitoring the further developments"" and remained in contact with US authorities, and said shipping via its DHL Express services ""remains possible"".
""The company's goal is to resume postal goods shipping to the US as quickly as possible,"" it said.
Earlier this week PostNord announced it was also suspending services as the US authorities only provided details about the required changes on 15 August.
""This decision is unfortunate but necessary to ensure full compliance of the newly implemented rules,"" said Bjorn Bergman, PostNord's head of group brand and communication.
Online marketplace Etsy said it was suspending shipping label purchases from 25 August for Australia Post, Canada Post, Royal Mail and Evri for US-bound packages while couriers adjusted services.
""The state of tariffs is evolving, so please be sure to keep an eye on recommendations from your preferred shipping carrier,"" Etsy said in advice to its sellers.
In Trump's ""big beautiful bill"",passed by Congress on 3 July, the change to de minimis was due to come into effect on 1 July 2027, but a recent executive order sped up the process by two years.
The new rule does not affect personal items Americans carry with them from foreign travel valued at $200 or less and it does not affect gifts valued at $100 or less.
The move is in response to a lower court ruling that some tariffs did not fall within the president's mandate.
Beijing's military parade shows how Trump has created new international bedfellows in just months, writes Anthony Zurcher.
Russia's Vladimir Putin met China's and India's leaders in Tianjin in a show of solidarity.
Parcels from China that are exempt from UK import tax more than doubled in value to £3bn last year.
Trade Adviser Peter Navarro's comments came hours after US tariffs of 50% on Indian goods kicked in.

Haden Pentecost, 41, was working on a flight from California to London when he started to become agitated and was described as ""sweating"" and ""babbling"".
A blood test later revealed Pentecost had methamphetamine and amphetamines in his system.
Pentecost, who has been sacked, pleaded guilty at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs.
The court heard Pentecost had to be stood down by his manager when he failed to help with any pre-flight safety checks.
After complaining of cramps and saying he had to change his clothes, he locked himself in one of the toilets - where a colleague later found him naked and oblivious to the fact, the court was told.
He had dilated pupils, a high heart rate, and had to be checked every 20 minutes until the plane arrived at Heathrow. Paramedics then took Pentecost to hospital.
Pentecost, of Basingstoke, was granted bail and will be sentenced at Isleworth Crown Court at a later date.

François Bayrouhas been ousted in a confidence vote after only nine months as prime minister, collapsing his minority government and plunging France into a political crisis.
Bayrou, 74, will hand his resignation toEmmanuel Macron, his longterm centrist ally, on Tuesday morning.
The French president now faces the challenge of appointing his third prime minister in only one year, and the fifth since he began his second term of office in 2022. His office said he would make the decision “in the coming days”.
Bayrou was toppled when 364 deputies voted that they had no confidence in the government. Just 194 gave him their confidence. Bayrou had called thevotehimself as a last-ditch gamble for support, saying he needed backing from parliament for austerity measures to reduce the public debt.
In a speech to parliament before the vote, Bayrou had saidFrancewas under threat from its “inexorable swamp of debt” and must find a “compromise” on a budget. He said if some “minimal” understanding and consensus was not found in the divided parliament then “government action will be destined to fail”.
When the leaders of opposition party groups, from the left to the far right, made fiercely critical speeches against him, he said: “I won’t respond to insults” and warned that the image of verbal “violence and contempt” among politicians was damaging democracy.
Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally’s parliamentary group told MPs that Bayrou’s departure was “the end of the agony of a phantom government”.
Le Pen, who was found guilty in March of theembezzlement of European parliamentary fundsthrough a fake jobs scam and banned from running for office for five years, said Macron must call a parliamentary election immediately, even if it meant she could not run again for her seat in northern France. She has appealed against her conviction and an appeal trial will begin in January.
Macron, who stunned the political world by calling asnap parliament electionlast year which resulted in a chamber divided into three blocs – left, centre and far right – has expressed reluctance to call another vote. The far right leads the polls and a new election could result in a similar hung parliament.
Politicians on the left, which won the most seats in last year’s election, but fell well short of an absolute majority, have said Macron should appoint a prime minister from their camp.
During Monday’s debate, Boris Vallaud called Macron “a defeated president” who he held responsible for “impoverishing the poor, enriching the rich and turning his back on the future”.
The Socialist MP said Bayrou’s decision to call the vote was not “an act of courage, but a cop-out”.
Mathilde Panot of La France Insoumise, a leftwing party, said Bayrou had been “severely beaten”. She added: “He wanted his hour of truth; he got it.”
Panot said that as just a third of parliament had given its confidence to Bayrou, Macron’s economic policies had a minority of support and he should also resign. The president, whose term ends in 2027, has always ruled out stepping down.
As head of state with authority on foreign policy and national security, Macron directly appoints a prime minister to run domestic affairs. But since last year’s election there has been no absolute majority in the national assembly, creating a form of political deadlock and disagreement on the budget. This means there is no certainty that a new prime minister would be safe from being ousted.

France is facing a day of protest actions on Wednesday organised online by a movement called “Block Everything”, which could see roads, schools and businesses shut down. Public sector strikes are to follow.
The priority for Macron is to appoint a prime minister able to push through a budget for 2026.
Bayrou’s unpopular plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt is now certain to be shelved, including his contested proposal to scrap two public holidays. Any new government will return to the drawing board.
Bayrou is the second PM to fall since the snap election in June last year – the rightwingMichel Barnier was oustedafter just three months in December. Bayrou had become the most unpopular French prime minister since 1958, largely over his unpopular budget but also his perceived lack of government action.
His popularity had also been dented by his stance on anabuse scandal at the Bétharram private Catholic schoolnear his home in south-west France.
Bayrou sent several of his children to the school, where his wife also taught catechism. Aparliamentary reportin July found Bayrou failed to act to prevent physical and sexual abuse at the school when he served as education minister between 1993 and 1997.
Bayrou was questioned by a parliamentary inquiry about whether he knew about abuse at Bétharram and covered it up. He said he had “hidden nothing”, saying his foes were leading a political campaign of “destruction” against him.
His criticisms of the parliamentary inquiry cost him support on Monday night even among his own centrists.
The northern politician Violette Spillebout, who co-chaired the parliamentary inquiry, said that despite being a fellow centrist, she abstained in the confidence vote out of anger at Bayrou’s comments on TV this weekend that the parliamentary inquiry was a “political tribune”. She said his comments were an “insult to victims”."

LOUIS (KMOV/Gray News) – A man in Missouri was charged Sunday with first-degree murder for his roommate’s death.
St. Louis City prosecutors said 54-year-old Marvin Byrd was charged with first-degree murder, armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a firearm and resisting arrest for a felony.
Byrd allegedly killed his roommate after they both went to watch a college football game in a small gathering, according to court records.
The 54-year-old became agitated with his roommate for not bringing household items and drugs to the event.
Police said Byrd then shot his roommate on the street and waited for officers to arrive on the scene.
When arrested, Byrd said his roommate was being verbally “reckless” and this had been “an accident.”
Officers said Byrd told them the shooting was the result of a long build-up of frustration against his roommate.
Byrd was taken into custody at the scene and is being held without bond at the St. Louis City Justice Center.
Dwayne Thomas, 58, was later identified as the victim.

(KMOV/Gray News) – A grandmother in Missouri who has been in the United States for nearly 50 years is being held by ICE and faces deportation to Ireland.
Jim Brown said his wife Donna, and Irish citizen, came to the U.S. when she was just 11 years old.
She is a legal resident alien, or green card carrier, but not a U.S. citizen.
Brown said the two got married eight years ago – a marriage that he believes should also protect her from being deported.
“It’s just not fair that you’re telling me I have to be a bachelor the rest of my life because of some stupid policy,” Brown said.
All was well, Brown says, until July. After returning from Ireland for a family funeral, on the way back at customs in Chicago, Donna was arrested.
“You don’t arrest 58-year-old grandmothers. It’s just wrong. She hasn’t committed crimes. You just don’t do that,” he said.
She has now spent more than 30 days behind bars at a county jail in Kentucky. The U.S. government is attempting to deport her. Brown believes she very well may get deported.
“It’s egregious that we have allowed a government to allow this to happen,” he said.
So, why is it being allowed?
Ten years ago, Donna wrote a bad check, charging documents say, for $25. She paid it back and got probation.
But Brown says the U.S. government is suddenly arguing that was a “crime of moral turpitude.”
The U.S. government says that’s a term used in the immigration context that has no statutory definition, but courts have held that moral turpitude “refers generally to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base, vile or depraved, contrary to the rules of morality.”
“I think it’s nonsense. I think it’s a blanket thing to catch everybody, to fill beds,” Brown said.
A direct result, he says, of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration policies.
“They signed a stupid bill that is torturing innocent people, and that’s the problem,” he said.
Now, he spends countless hours on the phone, trying to reach his wife, protest what he calls “deplorable” conditions in jail, and get her released.
“She’s been in this country 47 years, is married, with five kids and five grandkids, and you’re telling me she’s a flight risk?” he said.
Contacts with his representatives, he says, have gone nowhere.
Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe’s office, in a letter, said it was a “federal issue” only.
“I want somebody to have the guts and the fortitude to stand up and say, ‘You know what? This is wrong,’” Brown said.
Brown said he is a veteran that served 20 years to fight for the United States.
“It’s crazy that this is happening. It’s just crazy that this is even allowed in this country. That’s the problem. It shouldn’t even be thought that this should be OK,” he said.
And he says he won’t stop fighting for his wife. He hopes she will soon be free.
“My wife is not a criminal,” he said.
Brown says he’s now caring for their horses all alone on their nine-acre farm near Troy, Missouri.
He said his wife loves the “country lifestyle” – a lifestyle he now has to imagine without her.
KMOV has tried reaching Missouri’s U.S. senators Eric Schmitt and Josh Hawley, ICE and the White House. KMOV has not heard back from any of them about Donna’s situation.
In the meantime, there is aGoFundMefor Donna. Brown says he knows other people are in similar fights, and they are planning to donate a portion of the money to another person’s immigration legal battles.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/trump-epstein-birthday-book-oversight.html,t3_1nbwgxm,Trump's Epstein letter and drawing from 'birthday book' released,SoulardSTL,2025-09-08 18:57:04,7510,285,N/A,N/A,N/A,"House Democrats on Monday released a screenshot of what appears to be alettersigned by PresidentDonald Trump, which was included in a collection of notes sent to notorious sex offenderJeffrey Epsteinfor his 50th birthday in 2003.
The letter features a cryptic conversation between Trump and Epstein inside an apparently hand-drawn outline of a woman's torso.
Trump's signature is located just below the hips of the drawing.
The letter ispublicly visiblefor the first time since its existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in mid-July. Trump has not only denied writing the letter, but he sued the newspaper for defamation.
CNBC has requested comment from a spokesman for Trump's legal team.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asserted that the publication of the drawing ""PROVES this entire 'Birthday Card' story is false.""
""As I have said all along, it's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,"" Leavitt said in anX post.
""President Trump's legal team will continue to aggressively pursue litigation,"" she added.
Taylor Budowich, deputy White House chief of staff,claimed on Xthat the signature on the letter to Epstein is not Trump's. Budowich shared a series of pictures of documents Trump has recently signed in order to suggest that the 2003 signature was not a match.
But a review of Trump's signature over time reveals it has evolved significantly. ANew York Timesreport from 2016 about Trump's letters included several with signatures that much more closely resemble the one on the Epstein letter.
Both Democrats and Republicans on the House Oversight Committee are investigating records related to Epstein, the wealthy and well-connected financier who killed himself in prison in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.
Epstein's estate provided the entire ""birthday book"" and other documents in response to a subpoena from the committee.
Later in the day, the Republican committee majority releaseda full set of documentstotaling more than 350 pages.
In a statement, GOP committee Chair Rep. James Comer of Kentucky said it was, ""appalling Democrats on the Oversight Committee are cherry-picking documents and politicizing information received from the Epstein Estate today.""
The committee ""will pursue additional Epstein bank records based on this new information,"" he added.
Epstein was formerly Trump's friend, but had a falling out with him in the mid-2000s. Since Trump took office in January, Epstein has become a massive liability for the White House, and its response has drawn harsh criticism from both the far right and the left.
Trump, who stoked an array of conspiracy theories on the campaign trail, signaled that he would be open to releasing all the undisclosed criminal records in Epstein's case, known as ""the Epstein files."" But after one paltry disclosure, his Department of Justice said in a July memo that nothing further was warranted, prompting outrage from some of his own supporters.
The screenshot released Monday afternoon shows the letter exactly as it was described by The Wall Street Journal, which first uncovered the existence of the ""bawdy"" message on July 17.
Trump furiously denied writing that letter at the time, claiming, ""These are not my words, not the way I talk.""
He promptly filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the newspaper and media mogulRupert Murdoch.
After the letter was released Monday afternoon, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top-ranking Democrat on the oversight panel, said the document shows Trump is ""involved in a cover up"" of Epstein.
Comer, meanwhile, said Trump ""is not accused of any wrongdoing and Democrats are ignoring the new information the Committee received today.""
Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a20-year prison sentencefor conspiring with Epstein to procure young women for him to abuse, helped compile the book of birthday wishes.
Maxwell,in an interview in Julywith Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, said she could not recall the names of anyone who contributed to the birthday book.
""It's been so long,"" said the British ex-socialite, who has asked the Supreme Court to take her appeal of her conviction.

Residents from surrounding towns and villages climb as they try to reach the quake-hit region to assist survivors after Sunday night’s powerful 6.0-magnitude earthquake that struck several provinces, in the Nurgol district, Kunar province, eastern Afghanistan, Tuesday, Sept. 2, 2025. (AP Photo/Nava Jamshidi)
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — An initial United Nations assessment of the impact of Afghanistan’s recent deadly earthquake found 5,230 homes destroyed and 672 damaged in 49 villages — but the U.N. hasn’t been able to get to the vast majority of the remote villages.
Shannon O’Hara, the coordination chief for the U.N. humanitarian office in Afghanistan, said Monday that damaged roads in the country’s rugged and mountainous east where the 6.0 magnitude quake struck have made it extremely difficult to assess the impact in the 441 affected villages. A series of aftershocks ranging from 5.2 to 5.6 in magnitude added to the difficulties, she said.
The earthquake struck on Aug. 31,killing at least 2,200 people, and that figure could rise as more bodies are recovered. The United Nations estimates the quake has affected up to 500,000 people, more than half of them children and some of themAfghans forcibly returnedfrom neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
As an example of the difficulties the U.N. team has faced, O’Hara said it took her more than 6 1/2 hours to get from Jalalabad, the largest city near the quake area, to the worst-hit area roughly 100 kilometers away on the only road — a narrow, single-lane track carved into the mountainside blocked in places by large rocks from landslides.
Many vehicles, including trucks loaded with humanitarian aid, were trying to get up and down the valley to help, she said.
“As we drove towards the epicenter, we saw families walking in the opposite direction — displaced, carrying what little they could. Many were still wearing the same clothes from the night of the earthquake,” O’Hara said. “Mothers and fathers were carrying their children, some with fresh bandages covering their injuries.”
She said the devastation got worse as the U.N. team got closer to the epicenter, with entire villages destroyed and the overpowering smell of dead animals. Some families who havelost their homes and livelihoodswere living in crowded tents, while many others were sleeping under the open skies, exposed to rain and cold.
“There was no clean drinking water and no sanitation, with cholera endemic in the region, and initial assessments indicating that 92% of these communities are practicing open defecation,” she said. “The potential for a cholera outbreak is alarming. “
O’Hara, who has been in the quake-affected region for five days, reported the initial assessment at a video press conference with U.N. journalists.
She said the needs are overwhelming — clean water, food, tents, latrines and warm clothing as the region nears the start of winter snows at the end of October.
In visits to three camps for displaced people on Monday, O’Hara said women in particular emphasized their need for clean water and adequate clothing for themselves and for their children.
She said time is of the essence. “Any day, rainfall could cause flash floods in the valleys” where camps for the displaced have been set up and ”additional aftershocks could cause more severe landslides, cutting off access to communities still living near the epicenter,” O’Hara said.
“And snow will cut off access to these mountain valleys,” she said. “If we don’t act now, these communities may not survive the coming winter.”
The United Nations will be issuing an emergency appeal Tuesday for desperately needed funding to help quake survivors, O’Hara said.
She said Afghanistan’s rulingTaliban authoritiestook the lead in search and rescue operations and there has been no major obstruction to humanitarian operations.
As for women and girls whose activities are drastically curtailed by the Taliban, O’Hara said she had not received any reports of women being left behind by male-only rescue teams, and the U.N. is ensuring that women are part of health teams and aid distribution operations.

The US’s top public health agency was plunged into chaos on Wednesday after theTrump administrationmoved to oust its leader Susan Monarez, sworn in less than a month ago, as her lawyers said she would not resign and that she was being “targeted” for her pro-science stance.
Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was ousted on Wednesday evening, according to a statement from Department ofHealthand Human Services (HHS) that offered no explanation for its decision.
“Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people,” HHS said in an unsigned statement posted to social media. Her lawyers pushed back in a statement, saying she had “neither resigned nor received notification” from the White House of her termination.
Shortly thereafter, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Monarez had been dismissed, claiming she was “not aligned” with the president’s agenda.
“Since Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so,” he said, “the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC.”
Hours later, her lawyers, Mark Zaid and Abbe David Lowell,wroteon X that she had received formal notice of her removal. But they argued the action was legally invalid and that “only the president himself can fire her” as a Senate-confirmed appointee.
“For this reason,” they wrote, “we reject [the] notification Dr Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director.” They added that the legal team had informed the White House counsel of their position.
Monarez, who was confirmed by the Senate just last month, appeared to have run afoul of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, after she declined to support sweeping changes to US vaccine policies, according to reporting from theWashington Postand theNew York Times.
In an earlier statement, Zaid and Lowell asserted that the department’s attempt to fire Monarez was part of a broader effort to dismantle US public health institutions.
“First it was independent advisory committees and career experts. Then it was the dismissal of seasoned scientists. Now, Secretary Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk,” her lawyers, Mark Zaid and Abbe David Lowell,saidin a statement. “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.”
The ousting has set off a wave of departures within the agency, with at least three other CDC leaders publicly resigning after the HHS announcement.
The most explosive resignation letter came fromDr Demetre Daskalakis, who stepped down as the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases,according to Inside Medicine, an industry newsletter that obtained the full statements.
“I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health. You are the best team I have ever worked with, and you continue to shine despite this dark cloud over the agency and our profession,” Daskalakis wrote. “Please take care of yourself and your teams and make the right decisions for yourselves.”
Those concerns were echoed by another departing CDC leader, Dr Deb Houry, the chief medical officer, who wrote that “For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations.”
Daniel Jernigan, who ran the Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, has also quit the agency.
Hours before Monarez was removed, Kennedyhaileddecisions by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesdayrevokingthe emergency use authorization for the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax that CDC experts estimate saved 3.2 million lives in the United States.
Vaccines from the three manufacturers are now authorized by the FDAonly forpeople who are 65 and older, or younger people with an underlying medical condition that puts them at risk for severe disease. Even those that qualify for the vaccines will only be able to get them in the US if the advisory panel, reshaped by Kennedy to include Covid vaccine opponents, votes to approve them.
Monarez, 50, was the agency’s 21st director and the first to pass through Senate confirmation following a 2023 law. She was named acting director in January and then tapped as the nominee in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. She was sworn in on 31 July – less than a month ago – making her the shortest-serving CDC director in the history of the 79-year-old agency.
Public health experts, meanwhile, are sounding the alarm about the chaos.
“What’s happening at the CDC should frighten every American Regardless of whether you are MAGA, MAHA, neither, or don’t give a damn about labels or politics. It’s unclear whether the CDC director—confirmed just weeks ago—has been fired or not. Absolute shitshow,” Dr Craig Spencer, an emergency medicine doctor and professor at Brown University School of Public Health,posted. “And incredible career professionals resigned tonight, sounding a massive alarm,” he added. “This is pure chaos that leaves the country unprepared.”
“RFK, Jr is increasingly becoming a liability for the White House,” Dr Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University,observed.
“There is a wholesale destruction of leadership at the CDC. The newly confirmed Director is out,” Dr Ashish Jha, the Biden administration’s coronavirus response coordinator,wrote. “Most of the top leaders who run key centers have resigned en masse. Total implosion. All because of [Secretary Kennedy’s] leadership. What a complete disaster.”

A Minnesota teenager filed acharge of discriminationagainst a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant Tuesday, alleging a server followed her into the women’s restroom and demanded she “prove” she was a girl.
Gerika Mudra, 18, went to dinner in April with a friend in Owatonna, about an hour south of Minneapolis. When she went to the restroom, a server followed her inside and banged on the stall door while saying: “This is a women’s restroom. The man needs to get out of here,” according to Gender Justice, a Minnesota gender-equality organization that filed the charge on Mudra’s behalf.
Mudra, a biracial lesbian who isn’t transgender, said that she has been in similar situations before, when people have suggested she’s in the wrong restroom, but that when she tells them she’s a woman they leave her alone. However, when she came out of the stall at Buffalo Wild Wings and told the server, “I am a lady,” she said, the server responded, “You have to get out now,” Gender Justice said in a statement.
Mudra said she felt she had to prove to the server that she is a woman, so she unzipped her hoodie to show she has breasts. The server didn’t say anything in response but left the restroom, Mudra said.
“She made me feel very uncomfortable,” Mudra said. “After that, I just don’t like going in public bathrooms. I just hold it in. ... I want to be able to use the bathroom in peace.”
Inspire Brands, which represents Buffalo Wild Wings, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gender Justice filed the charge of discrimination with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights, arguing that what happened to Mudra violates the state’s Human Rights Act, which protects people from discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, among other protected statuses.
Sara Jane Baldwin, senior staff attorney at Gender Justice, said at a news conference Tuesday that even though Mudra isn’t trans, the server’s actions “were based on assumptions that she made about” Mudra, and that Minnesota’s law protects against discrimination based on stereotypes or assumptions about protected characteristics like gender identity.
“Businesses have a legal obligation not to just have antidiscrimination policies on paper, but to train staff and ensure that those policies are followed in real time,” Baldwin said. “When that doesn’t happen, the business is liable for the harm caused.”
Gender Justice said Mudra’s experience “reflects a broader climate of fear and suspicion aimed at anyone who doesn’t conform to narrow expectations of what girls and women ‘should’ look like.” That suspicion has been driven largely by the wave of state legislation targeting trans people, particularly their access to school sports and bathrooms that align with their gender identities, though Minnesota hasn’t enacted any such legislation.
Nineteen states have laws thatprohibit trans people from using bathroomsthat align with their gender identities in K-12 schools, and in many of those states the restrictions apply to other government-owned buildings, as well, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank.Twenty-seven statesprohibit trans people from playing on school sports teams that align with their gender identities.
Even before such laws, trans people had longreported facing harassment in public restroomsand avoided using them as a result. There have been several reports this year of women who aren’t transgender alleging harassment in public restrooms because they were suspected of being trans, including at theU.S. Capitol in January,Phoenix in February,Florida in MarchandBoston in May.
“This kind of gender policing is, unfortunately, nothing new,” Megan Peterson, executive director at Gender Justice, said in a statement. “And yet, in our current climate we have to ask: What if Gerika had been a trans person? Would this story have ended differently? That’s the terrifying reality too many trans people live with every day.”
Even if Mudra had been trans, she would be able to file a discrimination complaint under state law in Minnesota, which isone of 21 states and Washington, D.C., that explicitly prohibitdiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in public accommodations, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Two states explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation only, and six additional states interpret existing measures against discrimination based on sex to also include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Twenty-one states don’t have explicit protections from discrimination based on gender identity in public accommodations.

South Korean workers detained during amassive immigration raid on a Hyundai facilityinGeorgiawill be returned toSouth Koreaon a chartered flight, PresidentLee Jae Myung’s office said Sunday.
Federal and immigration agentsarrested 475 people on Thursday — mostly South Korean nationals— while executing a judicial search warrant as part of a criminal investigation into alleged unlawful employment at the facility.
“Negotiations for the release of the detained workers have been concluded,” a presidential spokesperson announced Sunday. “Only the administrative procedures remain, and once they are completed, a chartered flight will depart to bring our nationals home.”
More than 300 South Korean nationals were detained, according to the spokesperson.
The spokesperson added that South Korea will “push forward measures to review and improve the residency status and visa system for personnel traveling to the United States.”
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, PresidentDonald Trumpdenied that the incident had strained ties with South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy and a key U.S. ally in Asia.
“We have a great relationship with South Korea,” he said.
Trump added that “ICE was doing right, because they were here illegally. But we do have to work something out where we bring in experts so that our people can be trained, so that they can do it themselves.”
In post onTruth Social, he called on foreign companies to “please respect our Nation’s Immigration Laws.”
“Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,” Trump wrote. “What we ask in return is that you hire and train American Workers. Together, we will all work hard to make our Nation not only productive, but closer in unity than ever before.”
The U.S. raid, part of theTrump administration’s escalating crackdown on immigrants, was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the Department of Homeland Security.
A sea of agents from HSI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies showed up Thursday to the site in the town of Ellabell where Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, a battery company based in Seoul, are jointly building a plant next to the manufacturing facility for electric vehicles.
LG Energy Solution said Saturday that 47 of its employees were detained, 46 of them Korean. Another 250 personnel from “equipment partner companies,” most of them Korean, were also being held, it added.
The raid came just 11 days aftera summit between Trump and Lee at the White House, where South Korean firms pledged $150 billion in U.S. investments. In July, Seoul pledged another $350 billion in U.S. projects in an effort to reduce Trump’s threatened tariffs, which he later set at 15%.

VATICAN CITY --Pope Leo XIV declared a 15-year-old computer whiz the Catholic Church’s first millennial saint Sunday, giving the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model who used technology to spread the faith and earn the nickname “God’s influencer.”
Leo canonized Carlo Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter’s Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. During the first saint-making Mass of his pontificate, Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.
Leo said both men created “masterpieces” out of their lives by dedicating them to God.
“The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God’s plan,” Leo said in his homily. The new saints “are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.”
Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by increasingly intense religious devotion.
Acutis was particularly interested in computer science and devoured college-level books on programming even as a youngster. He earned the nickname “God’s Influencer,” thanks to his main tech legacy: a multilingual website documenting so-called Eucharistic miracles recognized by the church, a project he completed at a time when the development of such sites was the domain of professionals.
He was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day. The Catholic hierarchy has been trying to promote the practice of Eucharistic adoration because, according to polls, most Catholics don’t believe Christ is physically present in the Eucharistic hosts.
But Acutis limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones. That discipline and restraint has proved appealing to the Catholic hierarchy, which has sounded the alarm about the dangers of today's tech-driven society.
In October 2006, at age 15, Acutis fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days, he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.
In the years since his death, young Catholics have flocked by the millions to Assisi, where they can see the young Acutis through a glass-sided tomb, dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt. He seems as if he's sleeping, and questions have swirled about how his body was so well preserved, especially since parts of his heart have even toured the world as relics.
Both saint-making ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year, but werepostponed following Pope Francis’ deathin April. Francis had fervently pushed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to the faith while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.
“It’s like I can maybe not be as great as Carlo may be, but I can be looking after him and be like, ‘What would Carlo do?’” said Leo Kowalsky, an 8th grader at a Chicago school attached to the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish.
Kowalsky said he was particularly excited that his own namesake — Pope Leo — would be canonizing the patron of his school. “It’s kind of all mashed up into one thing, so it is a joy to be a part of,” Kowalsky said in an interview last week.
Much of Acutis’ popularity is thanks to a concerted campaign by the Vatican to give the next generation of faithful a “saint next door” who was ordinary but did extraordinary things in life. In Acutis, they found a relatable tech-savvy millennial — the term used to describe a person born roughly between 1981 and 1996 who was the first generation to reach adulthood in the newmillennium.
The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints’ enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.
An hour before the Mass, St. Peter’s Square was already full with pilgrims, many of them young millennial Italians, many with toddlers in strollers.
“I learned from different people what his professors, his teachers said about his joy and the light he carried around him,” said Leopoldo Antimi, a 27-year-old Roman who got to the square early to secure a spot. “So for me personally as an Italian, even on social networks that are used so much, it is important to have him as an influencer.”
Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross college in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis' canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.
“He becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world--with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,” he said in statement. “He is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.”
Frassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.

A legal aid group has sued to pre-emptively block any efforts by the U.S. government to deport a dozen Honduran children, saying it had ""credible"" information that such plans were quietly in the works.
The Arizona-based Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project on Friday added Honduran children to a lawsuit filed last weekend that resulted ina judge temporarily blockingthe deportation ofdozens of migrant children to their native Guatemala.
In a statement, FIRRP said it had received reports that the U.S. government will ""imminently move forward with a plan to illegally remove Honduran children in government custody as soon as this weekend, in direct violation of their right to seek protection in the United States and despite ongoing litigation that blocked similar attempted extra-legal removals for children from Guatemala.""
The organization did not immediately provide The Associated Press with details about what information it had received about the possible deportation of Honduran children. The amendment to the organization's lawsuit is sealed in federal court. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to email requests for comment on Friday and Saturday.
The Justice Department on Saturday provided what is perhaps its most detailed account of a chaotic Labor Day weekend involving the attempted deportation of 76 Guatemalan children. Its timeline was part of a request to lift a temporary hold on their removal.
Over Labor Day weekend, the Trump administration attempted to remove Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. alone and were living in shelters or with foster care families in the U.S.
Advocates who represent migrant children in court filed lawsuits across the country seeking to stop the government from removing the children, and on Sunday a federal judge stepped in to order that the kids stay in the U.S. for at least two weeks.
The government initially identified 457 Guatemalan children for possible deportation, according to Saturday's filing. None could have a pending asylum screening or claim, resulting in the removal of 91. They had to have parents or legal guardians in Guatemala and be at least 10 years old.
In the end, 327 children were found eligible for deportation, including 76 who boarded planes early Sunday in what the government described as a first phase, according to a statement by Angie Salazar, acting director of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Office of Refugee Resettlement. All 76 were at least 14 years old and ""self-reported"" that they had a parent or legal guardian in Guatemala but none in the United States.
The Justice Department said no planes took off, despite a comment by one of its attorneys in court Sunday that one may have taken off but returned.
Children who cross the border alone are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Health and Human Services Department. The children usually live in a network of shelters across the country that are overseen by the resettlement office until they are eventually released to a sponsor, usually a relative.
Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July's arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.
Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and El Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.
Justice Department lawyers said federal law allows the Department of Health and Human Services to ""repatriate"" or ""reunite"" children by taking them out of the U.S., as long as the child hasn't been a victim of ""severe"" human trafficking, is not at risk for becoming so if he or she is returned to their native country and does not face a ""a credible fear"" of persecution there. The child also cannot be ""repatriated"" if he or she has a pending asylum claim.
The FIRRP lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras who have expressed to the Florence Project that they do not want to return to Honduras, as well as four additional children from Guatemala who have come into government custody in Arizona since the suit was initially filed last week.
Some children have parents who are already in the United States.
The lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their legal right to present their cases to an immigration judge, to have access to legal counsel and to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.
Honduras' immigration director referred questions about the possibility of unaccompanied minors being returned to Honduras to the ministry charged with protecting children and families, which has not responded to messages left beginning Friday. Honduras' Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. government’s grossnational debthas surpassed $37 trillion, a record number that highlights the accelerating debt on America’s balance sheet and increased cost pressures on taxpayers.
The $37 trillion update is found in thelatest Treasury Department reportissued Tuesday which logs the nation’s daily finances.
The national debt eclipsed $37 trillion years sooner than pre-pandemic projections. The Congressional Budget Office’s January 2020 projections had gross federal debt eclipsing $37 trillion after fiscal year 2030. But the debt grew faster than expected because of a multi-year COVID-19 pandemic starting in 2020 that shut down much of the U.S. economy, where the federal government borrowed heavily under then-PresidentDonald Trumpand former President Joe Biden to stabilize the national economy and support a recovery.
And now, more government spending has been approved after Trump signed into lawRepublicans’ tax cut and spending legislationearlier this year. Thelawset to add $4.1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to Congressional Budget Officeestimates.
Chair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, Michael Peterson said in a statement that government borrowing puts upward pressure on interest rates, “adding costs for everyone and reducing private sector investment. Within the federal budget, the debt crowds out important priorities and creates a damaging cycle of more borrowing, more interest costs, and even more borrowing.”
Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution said Congress has a major role in setting in motion spending and revenue policy and the result of the Republicans’ tax law “means that we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2026, we’re going to borrow a lot over the course of 2027, and it’s just going to keep going.”
TheGovernment Accountability Officeoutlines some of the impacts of rising government debt on Americans — including higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages and cars, lower wages from businesses having less money available to invest, and more expensive goods and services.
Peterson points out how the trillion-dollar milestones are “piling up at a rapid rate.”
The U.S. hit $34 trillion in debt in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024. “We are now adding a trillion more to the national debt every 5 months,” Peterson said. “That’s more than twice as fast as the average rate over the last 25 years.”
The Joint Economic Committeeestimatesat the current average daily rate of growth an increase of another trillion dollars to the debt would be reached in approximately 173 days.
Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in a statement that “hopefully this milestone is enough to wake up policymakers to the reality that we need to do something, and we need to do it quickly.”

LONDON --Ukraine's cabinet building in Kyiv was among the targets of Russia's largest drone and missile attack of the war overnight into Sunday morning, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
Ukraine's air force said in a post to Telegram that Russia launched 810 drones and 13 missiles into the country in the latest barrage, of which 747 drones and four missiles were shot down. Nine missiles and 54 drones impacted across 33 locations, the air force said.
The total of 823 munitions made the attack Russia's largest to date, surpassing the 741 munitions reported by the air force on July 9.
At least two people were killed in the attack on Kyiv, local officials said. Elsewhere, impacts were reported in Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Chernihiv, Dnipro, Kremenchuk and Odesa regions.
At least eight civilians were killed and 59 injured by Russian attacks across Ukraine, local officials said.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Telegram that the attack damaged the ""roof and upper floors"" of the cabinet building located in the historic Pecherskyi district in the center of the city, which is home to many government buildings.
""Rescuers are extinguishing the fire,"" Svyrydenko wrote. ""I thank them for their work. We will restore the buildings. But lost lives cannot be returned. The enemy terrorizes and kills our people across the country every day.""
Both the prime minister and president urged an immediate response from the international community and more military assistance for Kyiv.
""Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have started long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,"" Zelenskyy wrote.
""It has been repeatedly stated in Washington that there will be sanctions for refusal to talk. We must implement everything agreed upon in Paris,"" the president added, referring to last week's meeting with European leaders and virtual talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in the French capital.
Zelenskyy said he spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron, who in a post to X said Moscow was ""locking itself ever deeper into the logic of war and terror.""
The Ukrainian president said in a post to Telegram, ""Together with France, we are preparing new measures to strengthen our defense.""
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ""appalled"" by the Russian strike.
""These cowardly strikes show that Putin believes he can act with impunity,"" Starmer said in a statement. ""He is not serious about peace.""
The overnight barrage prompted the scrambling of NATO fighter jets in Poland, the country's Armed Forces Operational Command wrote on X.
""Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace and ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached a state of maximum readiness,"" the command said. The alert last for around three hours.
Russia's Defense Ministry said in a statement posted to Telegram that its ""massive strike with high-precision weapons and strike unmanned aerial vehicles"" targeted ""facilities for the production, assembly, repair, storage and launch of unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as military air bases.""
The Defense Ministry said its forces shot down 69 Ukrainian drones overnight.
Debris from one Russian drone fell on the territory of the Ilsky Oil Refinery in the Krasnodar region, local officials said, causing a fire at one of the technological installations which was quickly extinguished with no casualties.
Voronezh regional Gov. Governor Alexander Gusev said one farm worker was seriously injured when a downed drone crashed. Private homes, farm buildings and power lines were damaged, Gusev said.
In the border region of Belgorod, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said that one person was injured by a drone attack that also damaged an administrative building.

reddit,r/news/,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/07/asia/japan-prime-minister-ishiba-resign-intl-hnk,t3_1namflb,Japan Prime Minister Ishiba to resign: reports,ani625,2025-09-07 06:53:47,3618,221,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Japanese Prime MinisterShigeru Ishibasaid on Sunday he had decided to resign, ushering in a potentially lengthy period of policy paralysis at a shaky moment for the world’s fourth-largest economy.
Ishiba, 68, instructed his Liberal Democratic Party – which has governed Japan for almost all of the post-war era - to hold an emergency leadership race, he told a press conference, adding he would continue his duties until his successor was elected.
Since coming to power less than a year ago, Ishiba has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majorities in elections for both houses of parliament amid voter anger over rising living costs.
Until Sunday, he had refused calls to step down following the latest of those losses in July’s upper house vote. He had focused instead on ironing out details of a trade deal with the United States on President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which have roiled Japan’s critical automotive industry and cast a shadow over weak growth.
“With Japan having signed the trade agreement and the president having signed the executive order, we have passed a key hurdle,” Ishiba said, his voice seeming to catch with emotion. “I would like to pass the baton to the next generation.”
Concern over political uncertainty led to a sell-off in Japan’s yen currency and its government bonds last week, with the yield on the 30-year bond hitting a record high on Wednesday.
Speculation over Ishiba’s fate was stoked by the LDP’s decision to schedule a vote for Monday on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election.
While a fresh leadership race could add pain for an economy hit by U.S. tariffs, markets are focusing more on the chance of Ishiba being replaced by an advocate of looser fiscal and monetary policy, such as LDP veteran Sanae Takaichi, who has criticised the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hikes.
Ishiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in last year’s LDP leadership run-off. Shinjiro Koizumi, the telegenic political scion who has gained prominence as Ishiba’s farm minister tasked with trying to cap soaring prices, is another possible successor.
“Given the political pressure mounting on Ishiba after the LDP’s repeated election losses, his resignation was inevitable,” said Kazutaka Maeda, economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
“As for potential successors, Koizumi and Takaichi are seen as the most likely candidates. While Koizumi is not expected to bring major changes, Takaichi’s stance on expansionary fiscal policy and her cautious approach to interest rate hikes could draw scrutiny from financial markets,” Maeda said.
Who is Japan’s ‘dragonfly’ prince, who could be the last emperor of the world’s oldest monarchy?
Since the party does not have a majority in either house, it is not guaranteed that the next LDP president will become prime minister.
Whoever becomes the next leader may choose to call a snap election to seek a mandate, analysts said. While Japan’s opposition remains fractured, the far-right, anti-immigration Sanseito party made big gains in July’s upper house election, bringing once-fringe ideas into the political mainstream.
Nearly 55% of respondents to a poll by Kyodo news agency published on Sunday said there was no need to hold an early election.
Ishiba’s last act as premier will have been to finalize the trade deal with the United States last week, under which Japan pledged $550 billion of investments in return for lower tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump.

Anutin Charnvirakul, a staunch royalist, has been appointed by lawmakers as Thailand’s next prime minister after days of heated negotiations and political drama.
The 58-year-old tycoon turned politician is considered a conservative, though he made a name for himself for leading a campaign to decriminalise cannabis. He was voted in after a chaotic scramble by parties to gain enough support to replace the ousted PM, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was removed from office by a court ruling.
Friday’s vote is a major setback for Paetongtarn’s family, one of the country’s most influential and polarising political dynasties.Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn’s billionaire father and a former leader himself,suddenly left the country by private jetthe night before the vote, prompting a frenzy of speculation. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday, when judges will rule on whether he has adequately served his sentence for previous convictions.
Thaksin said he had travelled to see a doctor in Dubai, where he spent much of his time in exile, and that he would return in time to attend court.
Thailand’s constitutional courtremoved Paetongtarn from officea week ago, saying she had violated ethical rules during her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. That made her the fourth member of her family to be ousted before reaching the end of her term. The ruling prompted a race between Pheu Thai and Anutin’s Bhumjaithai party to fill the position, with days of horse trading between rival parties.
Anutin, an experienced politician, comes from a family that owns one of Thailand’s biggest construction companies, which built Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport, as well as parliament itself.
He has served as deputy prime minister, interior minister and health minister, during which time he campaigned for cannabis legalisation. The legal changes were criticised for being rushed through without adequate safeguards, leading to an explosion of dispensaries and recreational use across Thailand, though Anutin says the policy was always focused on medical use.
Anutin told reporters as he exited parliament to visit his father in a hospital that he would work hard to solve the country’s problems. “I intend to work with my full capability,” he said. “I must work every day and make the most out of it, with no day off.”
He secured enough votes after promising the pro-reform People’s party that, were it to lend its support, he would hold an election in four months, and commit to changing Thailand’s constitution, possibly through holding a referendum.
The People’s party, formerly the Move Forward party, has little in common with Bhumjaithai, a conservative royalist party, but has said it believes this arrangement is the quickest way to bring about an election and reform Thailand’s system to make it more democratic. It will not join Anutin’s government.
Some of the supporters of the People’s party have questioned whether Anutin can be trusted to stick to his promises, however.
The deal allowed him to achieve a thumping victory over Chaikasem Nitisiri, 77, a veteran lawyer and the candidate put forward by Thaksin’s Pheu Thai.
Anutin won 311 votes, more than double Chaikasem’s 152.
The result adds to the problems facing Thaksin, whose popularity and political clout have faded since his return from 15 years in self-imposed exile in 2023.
He returned after striking a controversial deal with his old enemies in the conservative establishment. The arrangement, seen by many as a betrayal of his supporters, has crumbled, while his popularity has dwindled and his legal troubles mounted.
In a post on X, Thaksin said he was in Dubai for a medical checkup and to see old friends. “I will be back in Thailand by September 8 to personally attend court on the 9th,” he said."

America's imports and exports imbalance comes as President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to ripple through the global economy, despite the president imposing the tariffs in part to bring down the trade deficit.
The latest figures show U.S. imports were up nearly 6% in July, as American consumers and businesses rushed to stock up on goods ahead of the new set of August tariffs.
""I think people just want prices to not be high. And I'm trying to do that as best as I can, but I've been forced to raise my prices about 20% because of these tariffs,"" said small business owner David Levi.
For owners like Levi, the tariffs have already impacted operations.
Levi is a plaintiff in a case challenging the legality of President Trump's tariffs and says tariffs have made it harder for him to sell his product abroad.
""Because I do my final production here in America, I have to import the parts, get tariffed on those parts, and then send those parts assembled out. So that actually makes me a lot less competitive with other companies that just do all their production in china and then can ship directly from China to Japan,"" Levi said.

Tariffs may also be hurting U.S. products abroad by diminishing the ""Made-in-the-USA"" brand, according to marketing expert professor Dana Olsen.
""Tariffs have impacted American brands globally in a big way,"" Olsen said.
The global average favorability rating of the U.S. has been in negative territory since April. according to a Morning Consult survey."

The Jan. 6 rioter seen in photos wearing a ""Camp Auschwitz"" hoodie inside the U.S. Capitol building has been arrested in Virginia on charges stemming from a dog attack.
Robert Keith Packer, 60, was arrested on Thursday ""following an investigation into an animal-related incident"" that had occurred on Monday in Newport News, a city spokesperson said.
Packer was charged with one count of animal attack resulting from owner's disregard for human life, a felony, the spokesperson said. He was also charged with attacking while at large and no city license, both misdemeanors.
Civil charges have also been filed against Packer, including dogs running in a pack and vicious dog, the spokesperson said.
Police told Newport News ABC affiliateWVECthat four people were taken to the hospital with dog bites stemming from the attack.
""As part of the investigation, authorities seized one adult dog, six 11-week-old puppies, four live rabbits, and one deceased rabbit from the property,"" the spokesperson said.
The case is being investigated by the city's Animal Services division, police said.
Packer is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on Sept. 12. Online court records do not list any attorney information.
He was previously convicted in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, afterpleading guiltyin 2022 to one misdemeanor count of demonstrating inside the U.S. Capitol building and was sentenced to 75 days in prison in connection with the Capitol siege.
Federal prosecutors in the Jan. 6 case said that Packer has been a ""habitual criminal offender for 25 years with 21 convictions for mostly drunk driving, but also for larceny, drug possession, and forgery."" He was incarcerated for several previous offenses, they said.
He was ultimately pardoned, after President Donald Trumpissueda sweeping series of pardons for defendants charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack earlier this year.

South Korean PresidentLee Jae Myungordered “all-out efforts” to respond to the arrests of hundreds of its citizens in an immigration raid on aHyundai facility in Georgia, as the key American ally and trading partner reeled from the news.
Federal and immigration agentsarrested 475 people— mostly South Korean nationals — while executing a judicial search warrant as part of a criminal investigation into alleged unlawful employment at the facility.
At an emergency government meeting Saturday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said he was “deeply concerned” and felt “heavy responsibilities for the arrests of our citizens.”
The foreign ministry told NBC News that the government had set up a response team and that Cho was prepared to travel to Washington to meet officials if needed, while Cho reiterated earlier remarks made by Lee that the rights of South Koreans “must be not unjustly infringed.”
The raid, part of theTrump administration’s escalating crackdown on immigrants, was the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of the Department of Homeland Security.
A sea of agents from HSI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies showed up Thursday to the site in the town of Ellabell where Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building a battery plant next to their manufacturing facility for electric vehicles.
LG Energy Solution said Saturday that 47 of its employees were detained, 46 of them Korean. Another 250 personnel from “equipment partner companies,” most of them Korean, were also being held, it added.
“We are making every possible effort on all fronts for the prompt release of our personnel and partner company staff who have been detained,” the company said, adding that it had suspended employees’ business travel to the U.S. and urged those already there to “return home or remain at their accommodations.”
Hyundai said none of those detained were directly employed by the firm.
Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney representing two of the detained South Korean nationals, told NBC News on Friday that his clients were in the U.S. on the Visa Waiver Program, which permits tourism or business stays of up to 90 days.
“I’m convinced neither of these guys are violating their status in any way,” Kuck said, adding that both of his clients are process engineers who came over for meetings related to the construction of the new plant.
No criminal charges in connection with the investigation had been filed as of Friday.
The incident threatens to strain ties with South Korea, the world’s 10th-largest economy.
The raid came just 11 days aftera summit between Trump and Lee at the White House, where South Korean firms pledged $150 billion in U.S. investments. In July, Seoul pledged another $350 billion in U.S. projects in an effort to reduce Trump’s threatened tariffs, which he later set at 15%.
Jang Dong-hyuk, leader of the opposition People Power Party, warned in a Facebook post Saturday that the raid “could lead to wider repercussions for South Korean businesses and communities throughout the U.S.”
“This incident goes beyond a simple crackdown on undocumented immigrants and is a very serious matter,” he said, urging the government to safeguard “overseas Koreans and the rights of our businesspeople.”
“At a time when numerous South Korean companies are building factories and expanding investments across the U.S., repeated mass arrests of workers will inevitably escalate into a national-level risk,” he added.
A party spokesperson called the raid a “diplomatic disaster” and asked whether South Korea had been “slapped in the face after making huge investments.”
South Korea’s largest daily, Chosun Ilbo, struck a similar tone, framing the arrests as a betrayal and a harsh blow to South Korea.
“After Investing in ‘Trump MAGA,’ What Came Back Was the Arrest of 300 Koreans,” the headline read.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told NBC News on Friday that PresidentDonald Trumpremains committed “to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”

(WTVD) --A 23-year-old woman was stabbed to death on a Charlotte train over two weeks ago. Now, officials with the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) have released surveillance footage from the incident.
On Friday, Aug. 22, Iryna Zarutska boarded the CATS Blue Line and sat in an aisle seat in front of Decarlos Brown. Video footage shows that she was wearing headphones, and the two had no interaction, according toABC affiliate WSOC.
The train was en route to the East/West Boulevard Station, and there were many passengers on board.
During the ride, Brown, unprovoked, pulled out a knife and stabbed Zarutska to death. After the attack, video shows Brown walking to the other end of the train and removing his hoodie. Several passengers rushed to help Zarutska.
The train stopped about two minutes later, and Brown was immediately arrested by Charlotte police after stepping on the platform. He is facing first degree murder charges, and CATS banned him for life.
Brown also has a history of criminal activity and mental health issues,WSOC reported.
The 23-year-old victim was living in Charlotte after fleeing the war in Ukraine with her mother, sister and brother.
Those who knew Zarutska described her as a gifted and passionate artist who loved sculpting and designing clothing that reflected her vibrant spirit. She was also an animal lover who often cared for her neighbors' pets.
Inher obituary, it said: ""Many fondly remember seeing her walking them through the neighborhood, always with her radiant smile. She dreamed of pursuing a career as a Veterinary Assistant.""
Charlotte Mayor Vi Lylesreleased a statement on the incident: ""The video of the heartbreaking attack that took Iryna Zarutska's life is now public. I want to thank our media partners and community members who have chosen not to repost or share the footage out of respect for Iryna's family. This was a senseless and tragic loss. My prayers remain with her loved ones as they continue to grieve through an unimaginable time. Like so many of you, I'm heartbroken - and I've been thinking hard about what safety really looks like in our city. I remain committed to doing all we can to protect our residents and ensure Charlotte is a place where everyone feels safe."""

Guards atFlorida’s“Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail deployed teargas and engaged in a mass beating of detainees to quell a mini-uprising, it was reported on Friday.
The allegations, made by at least three detainees in phone calls to Miami’s Spanish language news channelNoticias 23, come as authorities race toempty the campin compliance with a judge’s order to close the remote tented camp in theEverglades wetlands.
The incident took place after several migrants held there began shouting for “freedom” after one received news a relative had died, according to the outlet. A team of guards then rushed in and began beating individuals indiscriminately with batons, and fired teargas at them, the detainees said.
“They’ve beaten everyone here, a lot of people have bled. Brother, teargas. We are immigrants, we are not criminals, we are not murderers,” one of the men reportedly told Noticias 23 in a call.
The detainees claimed a fire alarm was sounding continuously, and a helicopter was heard circling overhead.
Reports of “inhumane” conditions and brutality at the camp, where migrants are held in metal cages as they await deportation, have become commonplace.Donald Trumpand Florida’s Republican governor,Ron DeSantis,celebrated its harsh environmentas they toured the facility together when it opened last month.
Kathleen Williams, a federal judge in Miami, last week ordered Alligator Alcatraz toclose within 60 daysfor breaching environmental laws, and on Wednesday refused a motion by attorneys for the state of Florida and the Trump administration to stay her order.
It was not clear when the latest incident is alleged to have taken place, and the Guardian was unable to independently confirm details.
The Florida division of emergency management (FDEM), which operates the jail on behalf of federalImmigration and Customs Enforcement(Ice), denied it had occurred.
“These reports are manufactured. There is no uprising happening at Alligator Alcatraz. Detainees are given clean, safe living conditions and guards are properly trained on all state and federal protocols,” Stephanie Hartman, the department’s director of communications, said in an email.
Protesters who have maintained an almost constant presence at the jail’s gates since its 2 July opening said they were unaware of any incident amounting to an uprising, but have chronicled otherreports of abusetaking place there.
“People held inside the facility were on hunger strike for more than 14 days, despite the DeSantis administration denying it. What they apparently did was ship people who were hunger striking out to other facilities, Krome [in Miami], to Texas etc, to break it up,” said Noelle Damico, director of social justice at the Workers Circle.
“[An uprising] would not surprise me given the abuses that people have experienced.”
DeSantistold reporters on Wednesdaythat authorities have “increased the pace of the removals from there”, after Kevin Guthrie, executive director of FDEM, revealed in a memo, reportedby the Associated Press, that “we are probably going to be down to 0 individuals within a few days”.
The governor announced plans earlier this month for a new immigration jail in north Florida, to be called “the deportation depot”, while other states have joined the push to build detention camps with names mocking immigrants, including the “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana, and the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska."

BOISE — The Idaho Attorney General’s Office will not file charges against four Pocatello police officers who shot a teenager with developmental disabilities this spring.
The officers fired 14 times in fewer than two seconds, with 12 of the bullets hitting 17-year-old Victor Perez. The police were called to his home on April 5 for a report of a disturbance. The teenager died a week later after doctors amputated his leg and he was clinically declared brain dead.
The shooting garnered attention from around the world. Cell phone video of the incident has been viewed millions of times, and protests have been held across the state with participants demanding justice for Perez. Members of the communityexpressed outrageat City Council meetings and demanded the officers be arrested and charged.

The Eastern Idaho Critical Incident Task Force investigated the shooting, and Bannock County Prosecuting Attorney Ian Johnson asked the office of Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador to determine whether criminal charges should be filed.
In a 12-page letter sent to Johnson on Wednesday morning, Idaho Deputy Attorney General Jeff Nye acknowledged the shooting was a tragedy and explained why the officers will not be charged.
“The State would be unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the four officers who discharged their weapons were not justified in using deadly force,” Nye wrote. “We will thus not file criminal charges against the officers.”

Perez was nonverbal and had developmental delays, autism, aggressive behavior, abnormal gait and other medical conditions, according to his autopsy.
“His family tried to keep him away from knives for his protection and the protection of those around him. But on April 5, 2025, he managed to gain access to a large kitchen knife with an approximately 9-inch blade,” Nye wrote.
The afternoon of the shooting,surveillance video from a nearby businessshowed Perez’s grandfather, mother and 16-year-old sister struggling with him in the backyard. A neighbor began recording with his cell phone and called 911, explaining that a man who appeared to be intoxicated was wielding a knife and trying to stab other people.

The struggle between Perez and his family lasted around 13 minutes, according to Nye’s letter, and his sister “spent much of that time physically trying to control Perez by herself … without a weapon of her own and without any serious injuries to herself, Perez, or anyone else present.”
The 911 dispatcher requested that four officers respond, more than usual for a typical disturbance. The only information the officers had was what was relayed to them from the dispatcher. They did not hear the actual 911 call and were unaware of Perez’s disabilities or age.
None of the officers were given an address for the disturbance prior to arriving at the scene, according to Nye, and dispatch was working off the information provided by the 911 caller who said the address was “behind 702 North Main.” Perez’s residence was on North Harrison.
Officers from the Pocatello Police Department had responded to Perez’s home in the past, but none of them were present at the time of the shooting. Nye said AG investigators learned during the follow-up investigation that the Pocatello Police Department does not flag residences for mental health issues. Even though police had responded to calls involving Perez and his mental health before April 5, the home was not flagged in a system.
Nye provided a computer-aided dispatch report in his letter to Johnson showing what information the officers knew:
This computer-aided dispatch report shows the police communication surrounding the shooting of Victor Perez. | Idaho Attorney General
The officers each drove their own cars. Three of them were armed with Glock handguns, the other carried a beanbag shotgun.
They rushed to the backyard where Perez’s grandfather was on the outside of the fence leaning against the gate. He said, “No, no, that’s OK, that’s OK,” according to Nye’s letter. Perez’s sister, who was a few feet away from her brother with their mother, extended her arms toward the officers and shouted.
Officers quickly approached the fence, pointed their guns at Perez and yelled for him to put the knife down.
“He got up on his knees, lifted the knife in his left hand above his head, and pointed the blade toward the sky. He fell forward and caught himself using his hands. With his hands on the ground in front of him, he put his feet on the ground behind him. He stood up and took a step toward the officers. As he stepped, he put both hands on the knife in front of his body with the blade pointed up and toward the officers,” Nye wrote.
That’s when all four officers fired their weapons. Investigators estimated they were standing around 12 feet away from Perez, who was on the other side of the fence.
“The officers simultaneously fired a single volley of 14 bullets and a beanbag. All shots were fired within the span of less than 2 seconds. Perez’s autopsy report described 12 gunshot wounds,” Nye wrote.
Police performed life-saving measures before Perez was rushed to Portneuf Medical Center, where he died nearly a week later.
Following the Eastern Idaho Critical Incident Task Force investigation, the Attorney General’s Office conducted 15 additional interviews. The officers involved in the shooting spoke with the task force but declined to be interviewed by AG investigators.
“Instead, they provided audio recordings and transcripts of interviews they completed with a third party,” Nye wrote.
The Bannock County coroner sent Perez’s autopsy to the attorney general, and Spencer Fomby, a use-of-force expert, was hired to review the investigation.
Nye said the decision not to file charges was based on these six factors:
“This is a tragic and heart-rending situation, and our sympathies go out to the family and friends of Victor Perez,” Nye wrote. “It is especially tragic when viewed considering all the facts and circumstances available to us after the event. If the officers had known what we now know, our conclusions might be different. But, as previously stated, our decision must be based only on what the officers actually knew or reasonably believed at the time. And our decision must be based on the laws in effect.”
Nye noted that the law does not require officers to use less lethal options or retreat when deadly force is justified. He stated that Idaho is a stand your ground state, meaning anyone exercising self-defense or defending another can stand their ground “by use of all force and means which would appear to be necessary to a reasonable person in a similar situation.”
“The State would have to prove that the officers committed a crime when they shot and killed Perez and that the use of lethal force was not justified. The State would have to prove both the elements of the crime and the absence of a justification beyond a reasonable doubt,” Nye wrote.
The Attorney General’s investigation only applies to whether the officers should be charged. They are now cleared from criminal action, but there is still ongoing civil litigation over the shooting.
Additionally, the Pocatello Police Department conducted an administrative investigation to determine whether the officers followed department policy and whether they should have any consequences due to their behavior. Results of that investigation have not been released.
Nye also included answers to 10 questions as part of his letter, which we are included below.
One of the reasons Perez’s death is so tragic is that, in reality, he likely did not pose an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officers due to his disabilities. Under Idaho law, however, whether the officers’ use of force was justified depends on what the officers knew at the time. See I.C. § 19-202A(2). None of the officers who discharged their weapons were familiar with Perez or his disabilities.
We knew we had to address this question before making a charging decision because it would alter the legal analysis. The task force’s investigation revealed that officers from the Pocatello Police Department had previously responded to Perez’s home, but none of them were present at the time of the shooting in this case. Following the task force’s investigation, our office’s investigators conducted follow-up interviews with the officers who had previously responded to Perez’s home. These officers confirmed that they had not communicated any information about Perez to the officers who discharged their weapons in this matter. Our investigators were unable to find any evidence indicating that any of the officers who discharged their weapons on April 5 had previously responded to Perez’s house or had learned about Perez or his disabilities before the critical incident on April 5.
None of the responding officers were given an address for the disturbance prior to arriving at the scene. Dispatch was working off the information provided by the 911 caller and informed the officers only that it was “behind 702 N. Main.” Perez’s residence was on North Harrison.
In addition, our investigators learned during the follow-up investigation that the Pocatello Police Department does not flag residences for mental health issues. Perez’s residence was therefore not flagged for mental health issues prior to the April 5 critical incident even though the agency had responded to calls involving Perez and his mental health issues prior to April 5.
All four officers were in full uniform in broad daylight, pointing their guns at the individual with a knife, and yelling commands. The individual’s response was to stand holding the knife and then to move toward the officers. The officers could reasonably infer from those facts that even if this person did not understand the commands, he had no intention of cooperating with the officers and meant to do them harm, especially given that the officers were not familiar with Perez or his disabilities.
The officers’ bodycam videos suggest that both the grandpa and the sister were trying to deter the officers when they first arrived and while Perez was lying on the ground. As one of the officers acknowledged in his interview, Perez did not pose an immediate threat to the officers or others while he was lying on the ground. It was not until Perez refused commands to drop the knife, stood up, and started to approach the officers with the knife that they could reasonably believe he posed an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm. Even if the officers saw and heard the grandpa and the sister when they first arrived, their focus understandably shifted to the man with the knife who they were told had been trying to stab people and who was refusing commands and moving toward the officers.
Yes, the officers could have stepped back from the fence. However, the officers were not required to do so under Idaho law. See I.C. § 19-202A(3). Idaho law does not impose on any person a duty to retreat from a place he has a right to be before using deadly force.
Yes, there were a wide variety of tactical decisions the officers could have made when they arrived at the scene. In fact, our use of force expert opined that the officers made a suboptimal tactical decision by closing the distance to the fence. But he could not say their tactical decision fell outside of what any reasonable officer might do in the situation. More importantly, Idaho law does not require an officer or anyone else to make a sound tactical decision before standing his ground: “a person need not retreat from any place that person has a right to be.” I.C. § 19-202A(3).
Regardless of the quality of the officers’ tactical decisions, there is no reasonable argument that the officers did not have a right to stand on the outside of the fence surrounding the backyard when responding to a disturbance involving a male with a knife attempting to stab others.
An officer’s use of force is generally reviewed by each “round” or “volley” of shots fired. Additional shots would only be reevaluated if there were a change in circumstances that would affect the use of force analysis. Officers typically fire more than one shot in the initial volley because, “if lethal force is justified, officers are taught to keep shooting until the threat is over.” Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765, 777 (2014). Here, all four officers fired a single volley of shots that started and ended in less than two seconds.
The number of shots fired is due, in part, to the fact that four officers were present and all four officers fired their weapons. But the same use of force analysis applies to each officer individually with respect to self-defense or defense of another.
Each officer was equipped with a Taser, and one also carried a less-lethal shotgun at the time of the shooting. However, officers in Idaho are not legally required to attempt less-lethal methods before using deadly force. The relevant question is whether the use of deadly force was justified. Additionally, officers in Idaho and elsewhere are trained to respond to lethal threats with lethal force.
The Office of the Attorney General’s role in this matter is limited to reviewing the investigation for potential criminal charges against the officers. We have concluded only that the State would be unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the use of force was not justified. Our decision means the officers will not face criminal charges under Idaho law.
In addition to the criminal investigation, the Pocatello Police Department conducted an administrative investigation to determine whether the officers complied with department policy and what, if any, employment consequences there should be for their actions. Our understanding is that there is also ongoing civil litigation over this critical incident. It would not be appropriate for us to express an opinion — and this letter does not express an opinion — on any of those topics.
— Idaho Deputy Attorney General Jeff Nye

LONDON --Russia launched more than 500 drones and missiles into Ukraine overnight into Wednesday morning, according to Ukraine's air force, with explosions reported across the west of the country and NATO aircraft scrambling across the border in Poland.
Russia launched 502 attack and decoy drones plus 24 missiles in the latest overnight barrage, Ukraine's air force said in a Telegram post. Defending forces downed or suppressed 430 drones and 21 missiles, the air force said.
Impacts of 69 drones and three missiles were recorded across 14 locations, the air force said, with falling debris of downed munitions reported at 14 locations.
The barrage appeared to target several Ukrainian regions, with local authorities reporting explosions in the western regions of Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Khmelnytskyi and Lutsk. Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv's city administration, said that at least one drone crashed in the capital.
One person was killed in Khmelnytskyi, Serhiy Tyurin -- the head of the regional administration, wrote on Telegram. Two missiles and three drones were shot down over the region, Tyurin said.
Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said 15 Russian drones attacked the city, which sits around 40 miles from the Polish border. A warehouse was ""partially destroyed,"" Sadovyi said, with no casualties reported.
In Lutsk, Mayor Ihor Polishchuk said drones caused damage to ""civilian infrastructure.""
Svitlana Onyshchuk, the head of the Ivano-Frankivsk military administration, said attacks caused a fire at an industrial site prompting the deployment of 130 emergency personnel. Onyshchuk reported no casualties from the strike.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post to social media that the ""massive attack"" targeted ""civilian infrastructure, particularly energy facilities, a transportation hub, even a garage cooperative, and, as has already become routine for the Russians, residential areas.""
""These are clearly demonstrative Russian strikes,"" he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin ""is showing his impunity,"" Zelenskyy wrote, adding, ""It is only due to the lack of sufficient pressure, primarily on Russia’s war economy, that this aggression continues.""
Across the border in Poland, NATO aircraft took to the air amid the attack.
The Polish Armed Forces Operational Command said in a post to X that aircraft were deployed in response to Russian ""strikes on facilities located on the territory of Ukraine.""
""In our airspace, Polish and allied aircraft are operating intensively, while ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems have reached a state of maximum readiness,"" the statement read.
NATO forces in Poland returned to a normal level of readiness after around four hours with the conclusion of the Russian strikes, the command said in a follow-up post.
Russia is continuing its nightly barrages of Ukraine despite U.S.-led peace efforts -- and regardless of U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated admonitions of Putin over the long-range attacks.
Though August sawan easing of Russian attackswhen compared with a record-breaking July, the two weeks after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska saw a notable rise in the scale of Russian strikes all across Ukraine.
There were several high casualty events during the month, perhaps most notably the drone and missile barrage on Kyiv that killed at least 23 people on the night of Aug. 27-28.
Zelenskyy said in a statement posted to Telegram on Tuesday said the ongoing attacks show an ""open disregard by Russia for everything the world is doing to stop this war.""
Ukraine is continuing its own long-range strike campaign deep into Russia.
On Wednesday, the Defense Ministry in Moscow said its forces shot down at least 105 Ukrainian drones overnight.
Zelenskyy said on Monday that Kyiv intends to expand such attacks, which Ukrainian officials and commanders have framed as a means to undermine Moscow's war effort and force the Kremlin into genuine negotiations.
""We are preparing a technological headquarters involving manufacturers of Ukrainian missiles, key types of drones and air defense tools,"" Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. ""We will increase the production of our strike means.""

The Swiss food giant, which makes Kit Kat chocolate bars and Nespresso coffee capsules, said Laurent Freixe had been dismissed with ""immediate effect"" following an investigation led by Nestle's chair and lead independent director.
The BBC understands the inquiry was triggered by a report made through the company's whistleblowing channel.
Nestle chair Paul Bulcke said: ""This was a necessary decision. Nestle's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestle.""
The relationship was with an employee who is not on the executive board and the investigation began because it represented a conflict of interest, the BBC has learned.
As well as Mr Bulcke, independent director Pablo Isla oversaw the inquiry into Mr Freixe ""with the support of independent outside counsel"".
The Financial Times has reported that concerns were raised about Mr Freixe's relationship with an employee earlier this year and, after an internal investigation, the claims were found to be unsubstantiated.
After the complaints persisted, the newspaper reports that Nestle conducted another investigation with help from outside counsel after which the claims were upheld.
A spokesperson for Nestle said: ""We acted at all times in line with best practice corporate governance.
""The external investigation was opened shortly after the initial internal investigation, and today's decision shows that we are taking allegations and investigations seriously.""
On Wednesday, Nestle subsequently said: ""Laurent Freixe denied the relationship throughout the course of both investigations.""
Mr Freixe had been with Nestle for nearly 40 years but stepped up to the global chief executive role last September, replacing Mark Schneider.
Nestle confirmed that he will not receive an exit package.
The BBC has contacted Mr Freixe for comment.
Philipp Navratil, who has been with Nestle since 2001, has been appointed as Mr Freixe's successor.
Mr Bulcke said the company was ""not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance"".
Mr Bulcke is set to step down as chair next year and Mr Isla, the former boss of Zara-owner Inditex, has been proposed as his replacement.
Other companies have parted ways with their chief executives following investigations into their personal relationships with colleagues.
BP chief executive Bernard Looney, who led the oil giant for three years, quit after admitting he was not ""fully transparent"" initially.
Steve Easterbrook was fired by McDonald'sin 2019 after it found he had a consensual relationship with an employee.
But McDonald's said a further investigation found that the British executive had three additional relationships with staff.
He initially received $105m (£77.5m) in a severance package which he later returned. In 2023, he was fined $400,000 by the US financial watchdog for misleading investors. He paid the penalty without admitting or denying the claims.

Updated on:  September 1, 2025 / 10:03 AM EDT/ CBS News
Washington —The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn a request for testimony from Robert Mueller about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein due to new information on the former special counsel's health, a committee aide told CBS News.
""We've learned that Mr. Mueller has health issues that preclude him from being able to testify. The Committee has withdrawn its subpoena,"" the aide said in a statement.
Mueller, who led the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and delivered the long-anticipated report in March 2019, served as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 12 years. The New York TimesreportedSunday that the 81-year-old has Parkinson's disease, according to his family, who told the paper that he was diagnosed in 2021.
The committeeissued the subpoenato Mueller last month amid a slew of subpoenas seeking depositions from former Justice Department officials, among others. Mueller served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013.
""Because you were FBI Director during the time when Mr. Epstein was under investigation by the FBI, the Committee believes that you possess knowledge and information relevant to its investigation,"" committee chairman James Comer wrote in an Aug. 5letterto Mueller, directing him to appear for deposition on Sept. 2.
The development comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent months, following the Justice Department's issuing of the findings of an internal review, which found no ""client list"" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has spurred calls for greater transparency, while dividing President Trump's base.
Late last month, the administration released transcripts of a two-day interview with Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. And the House Oversight Committee plans to make some files it received from the DOJ related to Epstein public after redactions have been made.

The job losses will also hit outlets such as Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia.
More than 500 employees at the agency that runs Voice of America andother US government-funded international broadcasterswill lose their jobs, aTrumpadministration official announced.
Kari Lake, the acting CEO of the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), took to the X social media platform to announce further job cuts for VOA.
""The US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) has initiated what is known as a reduction in force (RIF) of a large number of its full-time federal employees,"" Lake wrote on X.
""I look forward to taking additional steps in the coming months to improve the functioning of a very broken agency and make sure America's voice is heard abroad where it matters most.""
The move comes despite a federal judge stopping Lake from firing Michael Abramowitz as VOA director, saying his removal would be ""plainly contrary to law.""
Furthermore, earlier in the week, US District Judge Royce Lamberth also separately ruled President Donald Trump's administration had yet to show it wascomplying with orders to restore VOA's operations.
His order on Monday gave the administration ""one final opportunity, short of a contempt trial"" to comply and ordered Lake sit for a deposition by lawyers for agency employees by September 15.
A group of agency employees who have sued to block VOA's elimination condemned the latest move by Lake.
""We find Lake's continued attacks on our agency abhorrent,” they said in a statement. ""We are looking forward to her deposition to hear whether her plan to dismantle VOA was done with the rigorous review process that Congress requires.""

In January, when Trump returned to office, he ordered the withdrawal of federal funds and the paring down of the international broadcaster Voice of America to the minimum allowed by Congress.
The latest set of layoffs, which would affect 532 employees, aims to follow Trump's order ""to help reduce federal bureaucracy, improve agency services and save the American people more of their hard-earned money,"" an official said.
USAGM oversees six entities, which, alongside VOA, include Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Marti.
The networks date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of US government-funded organizations that sought to extend the country's influence and combat authoritarianism.

Deployments reportedly set to take place largely in Republican-controlled states

TheTrump administrationreportedly plans to mobilize up to 1,700National Guardtroops across 19 states in the coming weeks to support its immigration and anti-crime crackdowns, a dramatic expansion of the controversial operation that’s seen federal agents and Guard troops carrying out activities across Washington, D.C.
Thetroops, who will largely be activated across Republican-controlled states, will serve in support of the administration’sImmigration and Customs Enforcementoperations, as well as other law enforcement priorities, according to comment from unnamed Pentagon officials and documents obtainedbyFox News.
TheGuardsmenassisting ICE will be carrying out tasks that may include “personal data collection, fingerprinting, DNA swabbing and photographing of personnel in ICE custody,"" an official told outlet.
Thedeploymentswill take place across the following states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wyoming, per Fox.
Texasis reportedly slated to have the largest deployment.
The Independenthas contacted the reported states for comment, as well as the central National Guard leadership and the Department of Homeland Security.
The Guardsmen will be serving under Title 32 Section 502F authority, in which they technically remain under state command and control, but can assist with federal missions and are paid with federal funds. The status allows them to avoid running afoul of a federal law limiting military involvement in domestic law enforcement.
When asked about the reported operation, the Defense Department referredThe Independentto aJulyannouncement from the Pentagon changing the status of troops supporting ICE to Title 32 and adding 500 additional personnel to the mission, bringing it to a total of approximately 1,700 troops.
The statement said the troops could be involved in “direct interaction with individuals in ICE custody,” and that the mission stemmed from a May request from the Department of Homeland Security for assistance.
“The Virginia National Guard plans to mobilize approximately 60 Soldiers and Airmen with a mission to provide administrative and logistics support to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at locations across the state,” a spokesperson toldThe Independent. “VNG personnel will not conduct law enforcement functions, and VNG support will not include making arrests.”
Nevada officials pointedThe Independentto aTuesday announcementfrom Gov. Joe Lombardo, which described up to 35 Nevada National Guardsmen assisting DHS with “vital clerical, administrative, and logistical support — ensuring there will be no direct contact with detainees, no law enforcement duties, and no weapons involved.”
A spokesperson for the Idaho National Guard toldThe Independentthe state’s contingent will feature 14 personnel providing three ICE offices with “administrative functions,” potentially including data entry, record keeping, creating and maintaining reports, and other clerical duties.
The apparent expansion in operations comes as President Trump threatened to send the “regular military” into Chicago for a similar crime crackdown, as well as potentially send troops to New York City.
“We're going to make our cities very, very safe.Chicagois a mess. You have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent, and we'll straighten that one out, probably next that'll be our next one after this, and it won't even be tough,” Trumptoldreporters at The White House.
Nearly 2,000 Guard troops from Washington, D.C., and six states are deployed to the capital as part of the president’s anti-crime and immigration push.
Washington residents overwhelmingly oppose the federal law enforcement operation there,according to polling.
The operation has nettedmore than 700 arrests since beginning earlier this month,according to the Trump administration, though it hasn’t released in-depth information about the identities or alleged offenses that form this figure.

It was long believed that Pauline Mullins Pusser, the wife of the legendary Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, was shot and killed in an ambush meant for her husband, but new evidence suggests that it was the late sheriff who killed his wife.
A Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report uncovered ""inconsistencies in Buford Pusser's statements to law enforcement and to others,"" District Attorney Mark Davidson said at a press conference Friday.
Law enforcement uncovered physical, medical, forensic, ballistic and reenactment evidence that contradicted the McNairy County sheriff's account of his wife's 1967 murder.
The sheriff's story inspired the movie ""Walking Tall"" in 1973 and several sequels, a 2004 remake and several books, Davidson said.
Buford Pusser died in a car accident in 1974.
""This case is not about tearing down a legend, it is about giving dignity and closure to Pauline and her family and ensuring that the truth is not buried with time,"" Davidson said.
The sheriff had reported that his wife volunteered to ride along with him in the dark, early morning hours on a disturbance call. He claimed that a car pulled alongside his and fired several shots toward them, killing Pauline and injuring him in what he claimed was an ambush intended for him carried out by unknown assailants, according to Davidson.
The sheriff, who was also shot in the ambush, recovered from his injuries and no viable suspects were found and no charges were filed.
Investigators now believe that Pauline Pusser was shot outside the vehicle then placed inside the vehicle, which is not what Buford Pusser has told investigators at the time of the murder.
""This was a cold case for decades but in 2022 TBI agents took another look at the archive file and coordinated with our office. That work accelerated in 2023 and in 2024, Pauline Mullins Pusser was exhumed for an autopsy,"" Davidson said.
""It's been said that the dead cannot cry out for justice, it is the duty of the living to do so. In this case that duty is being carried out 58 years later,"" Davidson said.
Investigators used modern forensic science and investigative techniques that were not available in 1967, officials said.
A new autopsy also revealed cranial trauma suffered by Pauline Pusser does not match crime scene photographs of the interior of the vehicle she was allegedly killed in. Blood splatter on the outside of the vehicle also contradicts Buford Pusser's account of the murder, Davidson said.
A forensic investigator also determined that a gunshot wound to Buford Pusser's cheek was a close contact wound, not long range as he had described, and was likely self inflicted, Davidson said. Blood splatter analysis also indicated that someone was injured both inside and outside the vehicle, he said.
Investigators now believe that the crime scene was staged.
The sheriff spent about 18 days in the hospital and required several surgeries to recover, Tennessee Bureau of Investigations Director David Rausch said at the press conference.
The case, which was based largely on his statement, closed ""perhaps too quickly,"" Rausch said.
Investigators received a tip about the possible murder weapon in spring 2023.
The autopsy also indicates that prior to her death, she had a nasal fracture that had healed most commonly caused by ""interpersonal trauma,"" according to Davidson.
If he were alive today, investigators believe they have produced enough probable cause that prosecutors could have delivered a criminal indictment for murder.
""Pauline's death was not an accident, not an act of chance, but based on the totality of the TBI investigative file, an act of intimate violence,"" Davidson said.
""Justice for Pauline has been a long time coming and thanks to all the hard work put in by many we are finally able to announce to Pauline's surviving family and to the public that we believe we are as close as possible to justice,"" he said.
Griffon Mullins, the brother of Pauline Pusser, thanked law enforcement for their work and urged others to accept the findings of the investigation.
""To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not terribly shocked,"" he said.
He said he was grateful to have gotten this closure so many years later.
""I loved her with all my heart and I've missed her horribly this last 57 years,"" Mullins said in a recorded statement.
""I am devastated. It's been a long time since she left ... I've had a lot of time to think and look back at Pauline's life. She didn't tell me a whole lot. She wasn't the type of person to tell you her problems, but I knew deep down there was problems in her marriage,"" Mullins said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Rep. Ronny Jackson announced that the Navy has restored his retired rank of rear admiral, overturning a 2022 demotion that followed a scathing investigation that found major issues with his behavior while he was the top White House physician.
The Texas Republican on Wednesdayposted a June 13 letter from Navy Secretary John Phelansaying he had reinstated Jackson to the retired rank of a one-star admiral following a “review of all applicable reports and references.” The Navy confirmed the move, with a spokesperson for Phelan saying he “greatly appreciates Congressman Jackson’s decades of distinguished naval service.”
The decision to restore Jackson’s rank comes as the Pentagon has become increasingly transparent in offering benefits and consideration to those it sees as personally loyal supporters of President Donald Trump, while those who are seen as unsupportive of Trump have been pushed out of senior roles across the military. Two weeks ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, who oversaw the intelligence agency that produced aninitial intelligence assessmentof U.S. damage to Iranian nuclear sites that angered Trump.
Following his 2019 retirement from the Navy, Jackson was retroactively demoted followinga yearslong investigation into his behaviorwhen he was a physician to Trump and former President Barack Obama. An inspector general’s report found that he made “sexual and denigrating” comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care.
Jackson gained notoriety for his over-the-top pronouncements about Trump’s health during his first term. He was elected to Congress in 2020 following a failed effort in the first Trump administration to appoint him the secretary of Veterans Affairs in 2018.
“I was, and still am, a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral, and Joe Biden is a retired old FOOL,” Jackson said on social media, where he has called himself an admiral despite his demotion.
Last week, military officials revealed thatAshli Babbitt, the rioter who was killed by a police officer during the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol,would be offered military funeral honors.
Babbitt was a U.S. Air Force veteran from California who was shot and killed wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders while trying to climb through the broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby inside the Capitol as rioters interrupted the counting of electoral votes certifying Trump’s 2020 loss to Biden.

President Donald Trump announces that the U.S. has carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean against a drug-carrying vessel that departed from Venezuela.
WASHINGTON (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpsaid Tuesday the U.S. has carried out a strike in the southern Caribbean against a drug-carrying vessel that departed fromVenezuelaand was operated by the Tren de Aragua gang.
The president said in a social media posting that 11 people were killed in the rare U.S. military operation in the Americas, a dramatic escalation in the Republican administration’s effort to stem the flow of narcotics from Latin America. Trump also posted a short video clip of a small vessel appearing to explode in flames.
“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States,” Trump said on Truth Social. “No U.S. Forces were harmed in this strike. Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America.”

The video appears to show a long, multi-engine speedboat traveling at sea when a bright flash of light bursts over the craft. The boat is then briefly seen covered in flames.
The video, which is largely in black and white, is not clear enough to see if the craft is carrying as many as 11 people. The video also did not show any large or clear stashes of drugs inside the boat.
Tren de Aragua originated more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in Venezuela’s central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years as more than 7.7 million Venezuelans fled economic turmoil and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.
Trump and administration officials have repeatedly blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some cities. And the president on Tuesday repeated his claim —contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment— that Tren de Aragua is operating under Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s control.
The White House did not immediately explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. The size of the gang is unclear, as is the extent to which its actions are coordinated across state lines and national borders.
After Trump announced the strike, Venezuelan state television showed Maduro and first lady Cilia Flores walking the streets of his childhood neighborhood. A television presenter said Maduro was “bathing in patriotic love” as he interacted with supporters.
“In the face of imperialist threats, God (is) with us,” Maduro told supporters.
Maduro did not address the strike directly, but charged that the U.S. is “coming for Venezuela’s riches,” including oil and gas. The South American country has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.
“From the neighborhoods of Caracas ... I tell you, there will be peace in Venezuela, with sovereignty,” he said.
Communications Minister Freddy Ñáñez questioned the veracity of the video. “Based on the video provided, it is very likely that it was created using Artificial Intelligence,” he said on his Telegram account. He couldn’t say what tools would have been used to create the video, but said it showed an “almost cartoonish animation, rather than a realistic depiction of an explosion.”
Trump and Secretary of StateMarco Rubiofirst announced the strike earlier Tuesday, shortly before Rubio left on a trip to Mexico and Ecuadorfor talks on drug cartels, security, tariffs and more.
In a brief exchange with reporters before departing Miami for Mexico City, Rubio deferred questions about the specifics of the strike to the Pentagon. He said the drugs on the vessel were likely headed to Trinidad or elsewhere in the Caribbean.
For years, Rubio has spoken out against Maduro and other Latin American leftist governments and supported opposition leaders. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, Rubio told Univision there was a “strong argument” to be made for the use of the U.S. military in Venezuela. He’s also accused Venezuelan officials of aiding drug traffickers.
Asked if Trump would carry out operations on Venezuelan soil, Rubio was opaque. “We’re going to take on drug cartels wherever they are and wherever they’re operating against the interests of the United States,” he said.
The operation came after the U.S. announced plans last month to boost itsmaritime force in the waters off Venezuelato combatthreats from Latin American drug cartels.
Maduro’s government has responded by deploying troops along Venezuela’s coast and border with neighboring Colombia, as well as by urging Venezuelans to enlist in a civilian militia.
Maduro has insisted that the U.S. is building a false drug-trafficking narrative to try to force him out of office. He and other government officials have repeatedly cited a United Nations report that they say shows traffickers attempt to move only 5% of the cocaine produced in Colombia through Venezuela. Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific and Caribbean, are the world’s top cocaine producers.

The latest U.N. World Drug Report shows that various countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, reported larger cocaine seizures in 2022 than in 2021, but it does not assign Venezuela the outsize role that the White House has in recent months.
“The impact of increased cocaine trafficking has been felt in Ecuador in particular, which has seen a wave of lethal violence in recent years linked to both local and transnational crime groups, most notably from Mexico and the Balkan countries,” according to the report.
Maduro on Monday told reporters he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms” if his country were attacked by U.S. forces deployed to the Caribbean.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C. ruled on Thursday that administration official Kari Lake had overstepped in firing the director of Voice of America.

A federal judgeruled on Thursdaythat Trump administration official Kari Lake can't unilaterally fire the director of Voice of America, saying she's breaking the law in trying to do so.
Instead, by law, Lake must have the explicit backing of an advisory panel set up by Congress to help insulate the international broadcaster and its sister networks from political pressure. As President Trump dismissed six of the seven members of the panel shortly after taking office and has not named their replacements to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Lake cannot take such an action.
Voice of America Director Michael Abramowitz had initially been offered a reassignment to oversee a handful of employees at ashortwave radio transmission facility in Greenville, N.C. But the reassignment would have been illegal, too, U.S Senior District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth wrote.
""The defendants do not even feign that their efforts to remove Abramowitz comply with that statutory requirement,"" Lamberth wrote in his decision. ""There is no longer a question of whether the termination was lawful.""
Lamberth is presiding over two lawsuits related to Lake's efforts to dismantle Voice of America and its federal parent agency. (In his ruling, Lamberth called Abramowitz's attempted firing ""yet another twist in the saga of the U.S. Agency for Global Media's efforts to dial back the operations of Voice of America contrary to statutory requirements."")
Abramowitz is among the plaintiffs suing Lake and the agency.
""I am very gratified by Judge Lamberth's ruling and his finding that the U.S. Agency for Global Media must follow the law as Congress mandated,"" Abramowitz says in a comment shared with NPR. ""It is especially urgent for Voice of America to resume robust programming, which is so important for the security and influence of the United States.""
The law states that Voice of America ""serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news"" abroad. Under Lake, Voice of America has been stripped of all but four of its 49 language services; more than 90% of its workforce has been laid off or put on leave and its creation of original content and coverage has dried to a trickle.
Lake said the Trump administration would appeal Lamberth's ruling. ""Elections have consequences, and President Trump runs the executive branch,"" she said. ""I have confidence that the Constitution will eventually be enforced, even if not by Judge Lamberth and other radical district judges.""
At a court hearing Monday, U.S. Justice Department attorneys pointed to President Trump's executive order in March to reduce the network to the smallest level allowed by law. As an example, Lamberth kept returning to the elimination of the Korean language service—though programming in that language is required by Congress under the law.
The government's attorney, Michael Velchik, said he contested that it was required, but did not elaborate.
In making their arguments, Velchik and his colleague Abigail Stout relied heavily on the executive powers assigned to the president under Article II of the U.S. Constitution and said that Lake was simply responding to that mandate. The Justice Department has asserted Constitutional authorities for the president that represent a vast expansion of his powers as commonly understood.
Lamberth, a conservative jurist first appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, on Monday pronounced Lake ""verging on contempt of court"" for failing to provide it with information he had demanded for months. He noted that Congress had expressly directed where hundreds of millions of dollars allocated for the agency should go, with the law affording little wiggle room. Simply telling hundreds of employees to cool their heels at home for months, he said, was a waste of taxpayer money.
In his ruling on Thursday, Lamberth batted away the government's procedural arguments and its broader claims about executive powers in this instance. And he rejected the assertion that the law protecting Voice of America's journalistic independence was unconstitutional.
""Defendants raise just one defense as to why the Court should decline to issue an injunction: they call upon the Court to declare that [law] violates the separation of powers by unduly interfering with the President's authority to remove inferior officers,"" he wrote. ""Because Supreme Court precedent on the President's removal power directly contradicts their position, the Court cannot do so.""
During the final stretch of Trump's first term, the chief executive he named to oversee the U.S. Agency for Global Media fought to exercise greater ideological control of all the networks funded by the federal government. They include nonprofits such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, among others.
In 2020, led by a bipartisan group of lawmakers including Marco Rubio, then a U.S. Senator representing Florida, Congress passed legislation to insulate the networks from political interference. The advisory board was part of that firewall.
Shortly after taking office for a second term in January, Trump fired all the members of that panel, called the International Broadcasting Advisory Board, save Rubio who, now serving as the U.S. Secretary of State, is automatically a member of the board. The president has not named any replacements.
As Lamberth recounted, in mid-March, after Trump's executive order, Abramowitz was indefinitely placed on paid administrative leave. In early July, he was told that the agency intended to reassign him to the shortwave radio station in North Carolina. The letter confirming this intent to shift him said he would be fired if he did not accept the new position.
Abramowitz filed a motion to the court on July 23 asking the judge to intervene.
Eight days later, a senior adviser to the agency wrote to Abramowitz that it was intending to remove him. Lake would serve as the final arbiter.
The government attorneys argued on Lake's behalf that Abramowitz should have gone through administrative remediation. But Judge Lamberth noted the law explicitly dictates that a Voice of America director cannot be appointed or removed without a bipartisan majority -- five of the seven members.
Lake, named initially to be a senior adviser to the agency, is now running it and has styled herself as its acting chief executive. As NPR has reported,it is not clear Lake is legally eligiblefor the presidentially-appointed role. Neither she nor the White House has produced any documentation that Trump has named her to it, despite repeated requests.

A federal appeals court has ruled that most of President Donald Trump'ssweeping global tariffsare unlawful, potentially dealing a significant blow to the president's effort to reshape the country's trade policy unilaterally.
In a 7-4 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected Trump's authority to carry out most of his tariffs, agreeing with the lower court that Trump's actions were ""invalid as contrary to law."" However, the court delayed the impact of its decision through mid-October to allow the Trump administration to appeal to the Supreme Court, as the tariffs remain in effect.
""Because we agree that [International Emergency Economic Powers Act's] grant of presidential authority to 'regulate' imports does not authorize the tariffs imposed by the Executive Orders, we affirm,"" the majority wrote.
The decision in effect tees up one of the most consequential legal questions for the Supreme Court about the scope of the president's authority on trade policy.
After Oct. 14, the court will return the case to the lower court to decide how theSupreme Court's recent decision limiting nationwide injunctionsaffects the decision.
In a post on his social media platform Friday evening, Trump rebuked the appeals court's decision, warning that a court order blocking the tariffs ""would literally destroy the United States of America.""
Previewing the legal challenge expected in the coming weeks, Trump called on the Supreme Court to rule that he has the power to impose tariffs unilaterally.
""Now, with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use them to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again! Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" Trump wrote.
In its decision Friday, the appeals court determined that only Congress, not the president alone, has the authority to impose tariffs, setting up a high-profile legal question for the Supreme Court regarding the scope of the president's power.
The decision centers on whether the authority to ""regulate"" imports, included in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, means the president can issue tariffs on his own.
Seven of the 11 judges said that the rarely used law does not give Trump the power to implement either his ""reciprocal"" tariffs or the ""trafficking"" tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico and China aimed at stopping the flow of fentanyl across U.S. borders, writing that ""tariffs are a core Congressional power.""
""We discern no clear congressional authorization by IEEPA for tariffs of the magnitude of the Reciprocal Tariffs and Trafficking Tariffs,"" the majority wrote. ""Given these considerations, we conclude Congress, in enacting IEEPA, did not give the President wide-ranging authority to impose tariffs of the nature of the Trafficking and Reciprocal Tariffs simply by the use of the term 'regulate . . . importation.'""
A subset of four judges from the majority took the decision even further, determining that IEEPA does not give Trump the power to issue any tariffs, not just the two types of tariffs in question.
""The Government's interpretation of IEEPA would be a functionally limitless delegation of Congressional taxation authority,"" they wrote.
In a minority opinion, four other judges disagreed, suggesting Trump's declaration of a national emergency is enough of an ""unusual and extraordinary threat"" to justify the tariffs.
""IEEPA's language, as confirmed by its history, authorizes tariffs to regulate importation,"" the judges wrote.
A group of small businesses and a coalition of statessued to block the tariffsearlier this year, arguing that President Trump had overstepped his authority under the rarely used International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) when he issued a flurry of tariffs in April.
The following month, the New York-based Court of International Trade declared the tariffs were unlawful and encroached on Congress's authority to regulate trade. The Trump administration quickly appealed the decision, which was stayed as the legal process played out.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard oral arguments on the tariffs in July, during which time the panel of judgesappeared skepticalthat Trump could justify the tariffs based on a national emergency.
The judges noted that the text of the IEEPA never explicitly mentions ""tariffs"" and that no other president has attempted to utilize the law in the same manner as Trump has.
""One of the major concerns I have is that IEEPA doesn't mention tariffs anywhere,"" one judge remarked during the arguments in June. ""Here, IEEPA doesn't even say tariffs -- doesn't even mention it.""
Ahead of Friday's decision, U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer preemptively asked the court to stay their decision to prevent ""serious harms"" to ongoing negotiations and the country's trade policy.
Trump administration officials had previously warned that losing the ability to issue tariffs would ""lead to dangerous diplomatic embarrassment,"" threaten ongoing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and ""threaten broader U.S. strategic interests at home and abroad.""

The posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent accusers, will be published in the autumn, a publisher has announced.
Giuffre had been working on Nobody’s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice, with the award-winning author and journalist Amy Wallace before her death earlier this year.
The 400-page book will be released on 21 October, according to the Associated Press.
Giuffre, who alleged she had been trafficked for sex to Prince Andrew, had completed the manuscriptbefore she took her own life in April, the publisher Alfred A Knopf said.
Prince Andrew has denied Giuffre’s allegations. In 2022, Giuffre and the prince reached an out-of-court settlement after she sued him for sexual assault.
Knopf’s statement includes an email Giuffre wrote to Wallace 25 days before her death, stating that it was her “heartfelt wish” the memoir be released “regardless” of her circumstances.
“The content of this book is crucial, as it aims to shed light on the systemic failures that allow the trafficking of vulnerable individuals across borders,” the email reads. “It is imperative that the truth is understood and that the issues surrounding this topic are addressed, both for the sake of justice and awareness.”
Giuffre had been hospitalised after a serious accident on 24 March, Knopf said, and sent the email on 1 April. She died on 25 April at her farm in Western Australia, where she had lived for several years.
“In the event of my passing, I would like to ensure that Nobody’s Girl is still released. I believe it has the potential to impact many lives and foster necessary discussions about these grave injustices,” she wrote to Wallace.
Knopf’s statement says the book contains “intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking new details about her time with Epstein, Maxwell and their many well-known friends, including Prince Andrew, about whom she speaks publicly for the first time since their out-of-court settlement in 2022.”
Knopf editor-in-chief, Jordan Pavlin, said Nobody’s Girl was a “raw and shocking” journey and “the story of a fierce spirit struggling to break free”.
In 2023, the New York Post reported that Giuffre had reached a deal “believed to be worth millions” with an undisclosed publisher.
Knopf spokesperson Todd Doughty told AP that she initially agreed to a seven-figure contract with Penguin Press, but moved with acquiring editor Emily Cunningham after she was hired by Knopf as executive editor last year.
Doughty declined to provide further details about the Epstein associates featured in Nobody’s Girl, but confirmed that Giuffre made “no allegations of abuse against [Donald] Trump”, who continues to face questions about the disgraced financier and his former friend.
Nobody’s Girl is distinct from Giuffre’s unpublished memoir The Billionaire’s Playboy Club, referenced in previous court filings and unsealed in 2019. Through Doughty, Wallace says she began working with Giuffre on a new memoir in spring 2021.
“Nobody’s Girl was both vigorously fact-checked and legally vetted,” a Knopf statement reads.
Giuffre’s co-author on her memoir, Wallace, is an award-winning magazine and newspaper reporter whose work has appeared in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, among other publications.
A representative for Andrew did not immediately return the AP’s request for comment. Buckingham Palace was asked for comment.

An experienced skydiver deliberately fell to her death in April after ending her relationship with her partner the night before, an inquest has heard.
Jade Damarell, 32, died of blunt trauma injuries after falling from 15,500ft (4,600 metres) into a field in Shotton Colliery, County Durham, on 27 April.
At an inquest at Crook civic centre in County Durham on Thursday, the coroner Leslie Hamilton gave a conclusion of suicide, finding that Damarell had intended to take her own life.
Hamilton summarised a note from her former partner, whom she had met through their shared love for skydiving, which read that “they had ended their relationship the night before”.
The inquest heard that Damarell, an experienced skydiver from Caerphilly in Wales had completed more than 500 jumps, including six on the day before her death.
On her final jump, however, the inquest was told that Damarell had deliberately not deployed her main parachute, which is usually opened at about 5,000ft. She had also turned off a device designed to automatically deploy a parachute at a certain speed or altitude should a skydiver be unable to do so. The parachute and device were found to be in full working order.
The inquest heard that Damarell normally wore a camera to capture her dives, but was not wearing one on the day she died.
Hamilton concluded that Damarell, a “very experienced” skydiver, had intended to end her own life.
The inquest heard that DI Andrew Stephenson of Durham police, who attended the scene, found that Damarell had left instructions on her phone’s lock screen about how to access it after her death. His report said that notes addressed to her family were found on the handset, which included her “apologising and thanking them for their support”, as well as details of her finances.
Speaking after the inquest, Damarell’s family accepted the coroner’s findings and thanked the skydiving community for its support, saying they were “incredibly comforted by how admired, respected and deeply loved she was”.
Describing her as “brilliant, beautiful, brave and truly extraordinary”, they said they wanted to speak “openly and without shame” about her death to “contribute to a culture where mental ill-health is met with kindness and support, and where people in deep distress, and those around them, feel seen, believed and able to reach for support without fear of judgment”.

The remedies decided by District Judge Amit Mehta have emerged after a years-long court battle over Google's dominance in online search.
The case centred around Google's position as the default search engine on a range of its own products such as Android and Chrome as well as others made by the likes of Apple.
The US Department of Justice haddemanded that Google sell Chrome- Tuesday's decision means the tech giant can keep it but it will be barred from having exclusive contracts and must share search data with rivals.
Google had proposed less drastic solutions, such as limiting its revenue-sharing agreements with firms like Apple to make its search enginethe default on their devices and browsers.
On Tuesday, the company indicated that it viewed the ruling as a victory, and said the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) probably contributed to the outcome.
""Today's decision recognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,"" Google said in a statement after the ruling.
""This underlines what we've been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want,"" the statement continued.
The tech giant had denied wrongdoing since charges were first filed against it in 2020, saying its market dominance is because its search engine is a superior product to others and consumers simply prefer it to others.
Last year, Judge Mehta ruled that Google had used unfair methods to establish a monopoly over the online search market, actively working to maintain a level of dominance to the extent it broke US law.
But in his decision, Judge Mehta said a complete sell-off of Chrome was ""a poor fit for this case"".
Google will also not have to sell off its Android operating system, which powers most of the world's smartphones.
The company had argued that off-loading parts of its operations, such as Android, would mean they would effectively stop working properly.
""Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal,"" Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater wrote on X after the ruling.
Sell Chrome to end search monopoly, Google told
What could Google monopoly ruling mean for you?
Shares in Alphabet, Google's parent company, jumped by more than 8% after the ruling.
Smartphone-makers such as Apple, Samsung and Motorola will also benefit.
Before the ruling, Google paid such firms billions of dollars to exclusively pre-load or promote the tech company's products.
It was revealed at trial that Google paid more than $26bn for such deals with Apple, Mozilla and others in 2021.
Now, Google will not be allowed to enter into any exclusive contracts for Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant or the Gemini app.
It means phone manufacturers will be free to pre-load or promote other search engines, browsers or AI assistants alongside Google's.
Google will, however, be able to continue paying distributors for default placement.
Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said the ruling was ""good news for big tech"".
""Apple also gets a nice win because the ruling forces Google to renegotiate the search deal annually,"" he said on X.
Judge Mehta's ruling ""doesn't seem to be as draconian as the market was expecting,"" said Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha.
With Google's search operation expected to generate close to $200bn this year, and tens of billions of that expected to go to distribution partners it is a win-win for the major corporate players involved in the case, Ms Otto said.
But Google competitor DuckDuckGo said the order failed to ""force the changes necessary to address Google's illegal behaviour"".
""As a result, consumers will continue to suffer,"" said DuckDuckGo founder and CEO Gabriel Weinberg.
The decision is not the end of the tech giant's court battles.
Later this month, Google is scheduled to go to trial in a separate case brought by the Justice Department where a judge found the company holds illegal monopolies in online advertising technology.

British celebrity chef and restaurateur Gordon Ramsay shared Saturday on Instagram that he was diagnosed with skin cancer, which he said he got removed.
The fiery 58-year-old TV personality shared a picture of a bandage over part of his face and neck, and another showing a line of stitches from his earlobe to the top of his neck.
“Grateful and so appreciative for the incredible team at The Skin Associates and their fast reactive work on removing this Basal Cell Carcinoma thank you !” Ramsay wrote in the caption of his post. “Please don’t forget your sunscreen this weekend.”
Ramsay joked that he did not get a face-lift.
“I’d need a refund,” he wrote.
Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that begins in the basal cells, which produce new skin cells to replace the ones that die, according to the Mayo Clinic. This type of skin cancer most often occurs on parts of the skin that are exposed to sun, such as the head and neck, and can take many forms on the skin, including a slightly transparent or brown bump.
“Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight,” the Mayo Clinic says. “Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma.”
Ramsay is the star behind multiple cooking reality-TV shows, including “Hell’s Kitchen,” “Kitchen Nightmares” and “MasterChef.” His latest show, “Gordon Ramsay’s Secret Service,” premiered on Fox this May.
The Michelin-starred chef also owns and operates over 80 restaurants around the world, including more than 20 across the United States.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — A cyberattack caused Nevada’s state offices to close for two days this week and rendered some state websites and phone lines unavailable, the governor’s office said Tuesday.
Agencies will announce when their counters will reopen for in-person services, according to the technology office of Gov. Joe Lombardo, whose website was among those disabled.
The state identified the attack Sunday and said authorities are investigating. Officials were unable to release technical details to protect internal systems during the investigation, the memo said.
There is no evidence that personal information was compromised, it added. Emergency services remained available.
State employees were put on administrative leave Monday. Many returned to work Tuesday, and workers will continue to come back to the office as their computer systems are brought online.
Previous cyberattackshave crippled public services elsewhere in the U.S.
In 2020, for example, anattack on Oregon’s Tillamook Countytook down its computer systems and website.
And in 2018 aransomware attack shut downautomated 911 dispatching in Baltimore for roughly 17 hours.

The Wisconsin husband and father, who authorities saidfaked his own death at a lakeand fled the country, has been sentenced to 89 days in jail -- the same number of days he was missing, a judge ruled.
Ryan Borgwardt, 45, appeared in court on Tuesday to plead no contest to the misdemeanor charge of obstructing an officer and receive his sentence.
Though the prosecution and defense both recommended 45 days in jail, the judge sentenced Borgwardt to 89 days, citing the number of days his deception lasted. The maximum sentence for the charge is nine months in jail.
""I deeply regret the actions that I did that night and all the pain that I caused my family and friends,"" Borgwardt said in court.
""He is here taking responsibility for his actions,"" defense attorney Erik Johnson added.
Borgwardt was accused ofintentionally misleading authoritiesto believe he drowned in August 2024.
Borgwardt ""researched and studied how to successfully disappear"" and believed that ""Green Lake’s great depth would mean that a body would not surface,"" the prosecution said in court Tuesday. Borgwardt then traveled to the country of Georgia and created a life with a woman he met online, prosecutors said.
The disappearance began on Aug. 11, when Borgwardt texted his wife that he was turning his kayak around on Green Lake and heading to shore soon -- but he never came home, officials said.
Crews found Borgwardt's overturned kayak and life jacket, officials said, and authorities and volunteers then spent weeks searching the lake for him.
In October, investigators discovered Borgwardt's name had been checked by law enforcement in Canada two days after he vanished, authorities said. They also learned Borgwardt had been communicating with a woman from Uzbekistan, authorities said.
Borgwardt's other suspicious behavior included: clearing his browsers the day he disappeared, inquiring about moving funds to foreign banks, obtaining a new passport and getting a new life insurance policy, authorities said.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer on Monday issued a new subpoena to the estate of Jeffrey Epstein for ""documents and communications in its possession, custody, or control in unredacted form,"" which includes a copy of the alleged ""birthday book"" compiled for disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday.
""It is our understanding that the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein is in custody and control of documents that may further the Committee's investigation and legislative goals. Further, it is our understanding the Estate is ready and willing to provide these documents to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena,"" Comer said in a statement on Monday.
The committee requested a delivery of the documents -- which includes banking and financial records -- on or before Sept. 8, 2025. Comer said the panel is ""reviewing"" potential ""mismanagement of the federal government's investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell.""
House Democrats previously requested a copyof the alleged ""birthday book"" compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003 that theWall Street Journal reportedcontains a ""bawdy"" letter from President Donald Trump.
Trump has denied the existence of the letter and filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal. ABC News has not been able to confirm the existence of the letter.
Dow Jones, the parent company of the newspaper, said in a statement that it has ""full confidence in the rigor and accuracy"" of its reporting and ""will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.""
Epstein's former associate Ghislaine Maxwelltold a top official for the Justice Departmentthat Epstein asked her to coordinate contributions to his 50th birthday book, but said she could not recall if Trump, then a private citizen, was among those who responded, according to a transcript of Maxwell's interview last month with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. In that interview, Maxwell continued to profess her innocence.
Maxwell was convicted in 2021 by a federal jury on sex trafficking and other charges. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding and participating in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls, which involved a scheme to recruit young women and girls for massages of Epstein that turned sexual. Federal prosecutors in New York said Maxwell helped Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately abuse girls as young as 14.
Also in the subpoena are requests for documents tied to Epstein's bank accounts, financial transactions, flight logs and calendars from Jan. 1, 1990 through Aug. 10, 2019.
Brad Edwards, an attorney who has represented more than 200 of Epstein's victims, had previously encouraged lawmakers to subpoena the estate for the alleged birthday book. Edwards told ABC News on Monday that the estate ought to be able to swiftly comply with the requests.
""Jeffrey Epstein is dead, so, after making all redactions for victim identifying information, the estate can easily turn over all the documents requested without objection or delay. And, because of previous litigation, the vast majority of redactions should have already been made,"" Edwards said.
The House Oversight Committee also announced that Alexander Acosta, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida and former secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor, will appear voluntarily for a transcribed interview on Sept. 19, 2025. Acosta was previously found to have exercised ""poor judgement"" when he resolved a federal investigation into Epstein through a state-based plea agreement in 2008, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibilityconcluded in a 2020 report.
Comer said the panel will allow for ""written declarations"" from former attorneys general Alberto Gonzelez, Eric Holder and Jeff Sessions instead of in-person interviews. The three individuals, who were subpoenaed by the committee, plan to formally declare they have no information on Epstein, according to Comer.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — The founder of a California-based porn empire that recruited women with false modeling offers was sentenced Monday to 27 years in federal prison.
Michael James Prattpleaded guilty in June infederal courtin San Diego. Federal prosecutors said Pratt and his co-defendants used force, fraud and coercion to recruit hundreds of women, many of whom were in their late teens, for their adult videos.
The San Diego Union-Tribunereportedthat U.S. District Judge Janis Sammartino sentenced Pratt on one charge of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and one count of conspiracy to commit the same crime.
Pratt was on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list when he was arrested in Madrid in 2022, three years after he fled while facing sex trafficking charges.
A New Zealand native, he founded the now-defunct GirlsDoPorn website in San Diego. In 2019, he and others were charged in San Diego with sex crimes after being targeted in a civil lawsuit by 22 women who claimed they were victimized by fraud and breach of contract.
The women said they were plied with alcohol and marijuana before being rushed through signing a contract, which they were not allowed to read. Some said they were sexually assaulted and held in hotel rooms unwillingly until filming had ended.
A judge in 2020 foundin favor of the womenand handed down a $12.7 million judgment against Pratt, Matthew Isaac Wolfe and adult producer and performer Ruben Andre Garcia.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/ohio-private-charter-school-buses,t3_1mq4hx5,Ohio requires buses for private school kids. Public school students have to find their own ride.,_Life_as_a_Train_,2025-08-14 15:52:07,35252,1370,N/A,N/A,N/A,"School districts are responsible for transporting private and charter school kids, leaving thousands of public school students behind
For about 2,000 students attending high school in Dayton,Ohio, there won’t be a bus in sight when they walk out the door for the beginning of the school year this week.
Ruben Castillo, an 11th grade student at Meadowdale Career Technology Center, is one of them.
Ohio law means that public school districts such as Dayton’s are responsible for transporting students who attend private and charter schools. When they fail to do so, they risk fines ofmillions of dollars.
A shortage of drivers and buses combined with the threat of fines, means that public school districts in Dayton and aroundOhiofind themselves relegating their own students to the back of the transportation line.
“I’m going to have to use Uber, and it’s going to cost me $25-$30 a day to get to and from school,” says Castillo. “In wintertime, when demand is higher, it’s probably going to be more.” At 180 school days over the course of a year, that’s thousands of dollars he is set to fork out from his own pocket.
For the past several years, school administrators in Dayton, Cincinnati and elsewhere have been trying to get around the problem by issuing students with bus passes for public transportation.
But children riding public buses havereported being subjected to a variety of dangers. Public transportation administrators have also reported difficulties trying to serve the public and thousands of students all at once.
The situation came to a tragic head on the morning of 4 April when 18-year-old Alfred Hale III was shot dead at the public bus hub in downtown Dayton while en route to class at Dunbar high school. Shortly after Hale’s killing, Ohio lawmakers introduced a law making it illegal for Dayton public schools (DPS) to buy public bus vouchers for students.
The burden of getting children to school now falls on students’ parents, grandparents, local churches and charities, say officials. Families who choose to continue to have their students use public buses to get to and from school will have to fork outat least $540per high school student a year.
“There seems to be an aggressive approach to the most vulnerable families and people in America,” says DPS’s superintendent, David Lawrence.
“Not only is it unfair, it’s onerous that public schools have to provide transportation to non-public school students.”
What’s happening in Ohio is a result of a wider effort by conservative politicians to push for more children to attend charter and private schools, many of which are run by religious organizations.
Republican politicians hold a supermajority across Ohio’s legislature and have built up a$1bn fundin the form of vouchers for families who want to send their students to private and charter schools.
Ohio is not alone.
Republican-dominated state legislatures have been pushing for or have already enacted laws that see billions of dollars of taxpayer money directed to funding private school voucher systems inTexas, Florida, Iowa, Tennessee and elsewhere.
In Pennsylvania and Minnesota, where political control is largely split between Democrats and Republicans, public schools are required to provide transportation for students attending non-public schools. In January, Donald Trump signed an executive ordersteering taxpayer fundsfrom public schools to private schools.
Many in Democratic-leaning cities say they are being targeted.
In Cincinnati,children as young as 13are being forced to use public transportation to get to and from school due to funding shortages that this year will see more than 100 yellow bus routes cut.

A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration
after newsletter promotion
In Columbus, where more than half of all students are African American, the public school system is required to bus students of 162 private and charter schools.
About 1.8 million, or 80%, of all school-going students in Ohio attend public schools and nearly two-thirds of students attending Dayton public schools are African American. In July, the state passed a budget that saw the smallest increase in spending on K-12 public educationin more than a decade.
“It’s simple – if we did not have to bus non-public school students on our transportation, we could transport every single one of our K-12 students on yellow buses,” says Jocelyn Rhynard, a member of the Dayton public school board. DPS transports between 4,000 and 5,000 charter and private school students every school day.
“It’s a direct result of the legislation from the extremist Republicans at the Ohio statehouse mandating that we must transport non-public students as well as public students in our district.”
But Republican politicians disagree.
“We had an 18-year-old get shot and killed. The environment for the students is not good down there. The NAACP interviewed the children, they don’t want to ride the public transportation buses, they want to ride the yellow school buses,” says Phil Plummer, a Republican party state representative who spearheaded the budget amendment banning DPS from giving its students public bus vouchers.
Plummer says he and others “found 25 school buses” that DPS could purchase. “They decided not to transport their kids,” he says.
DPS administrators, who pay drivers the highest rates in the region, say about 70 buses would be required to meet the need, a number that could take up to two years to procure. Lawrence says the process of buying buses and training drivers is not simple.
“It’s an 18-month cycle. [Buses] are $150,000 to $190,000 each to buy, and ones with backup cameras and air conditioning are [even] more expensive. Then drivers have to take at least 10 tests before they become fully qualified,” he says.
With the law coming into effect just months before the new school year, parents, students and public school managers have been left in a difficult situation.
“I’m a single dad raising two kids on my own. We all have to be at school at the same time. That’s a big dilemma,” says William Johnson, an educator at DPS whose daughter is no longer able to get to school using a bus provided by or paid for the district.
“I’m lucky that my 80-year-old father is going to help out taking them to school. But I ask the state [politicians] – please come up with a solution. We’re going to lose a whole generation of kids if this continues.”"

A murder charge will likely turn to capital murder for the man accused of gunning down an 11-year-old boy. He was playing Ding Dong Ditch at the shooter's home.
HOUSTON-Amurder chargewill likely be upgraded to capital murder for the man accused of fatally shooting an 11-year-old boy who had been playing ""ding-dong-ditch"" outside his east Houston home, according to Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare.
What they're saying:
Authorities sayGonzalo Leon Jr.was waiting by his home in the dark late Saturday night when 11-year-old Jullian Guzman and his cousin knocked on his door for the last time. The kids had knocked on the door multiple times, running away each time, and in their final attempt, investigators allege Leon opened fire, striking Guzman in the back as he ran.
Records say Guzman's cousin recalls seeing Leon come out from a gate by the house and step out to the street before he began shooting. They say Leon shot once at the ground before firing another shot at the boys.
""This was someone brutally murdering an 11-year-old simply because they were mad,"" said Teare. ""We have a little boy who didn’t even have a chance to get his life going yet, struck down for nothing.""
Guzman and his cousin ran about a block away before Guzman collapsed, according to records. They say his cousin tried to drag him to safety, but Guzman later died at the hospital.

Leon Gonzalo Jr., 42, has been charged with murder for the deadly shooting of an 11-year-old boy who police say was killed while playing ""ding dong ditch"" in Houston over the weekend.
Dig deeper:
Records say investigators recovered more than 20 firearms from Leon’s home, including rifles, long guns and handguns. Teare says they believe a medium-caliber handgun was used in the shooting.
""He just shot him down in the street and went about his business,"" Teare said. ""What you can never do is discharge your firearm out of anger, ever. When things like that happen, tragedies like this occur.""
Leon was initially detained and released twice before his final arrest. He has not made a statement to investigators, officials said.
Records show Leon is a father himself, with a young child inside the home at the time of the shooting.
The suspect in the fatal shooting of an 11-year-old who was playing a ding-dong ditch prank is believed to have been lying in wait with a gun to shoot at the child.
Clarifying online chatter:
Teare also pushed back against online speculation that the incident was connected to a social media challenge that involves kids doing more egregious things to neighboring homes, like kicking doors, sometimes while masked and brandishing fake guns. Teare says that simply wasn't the case here, saying Guzman and his cousin were only ringing the doorbell and running away.
""Kids have been doing this for decades,"" said Teare.
What's next:
A bond hearing is scheduled for Wednesday. Prosecutors said they will request a $1 million bond.

Rudy Giulianihas been discharged from a New Hampshire hospital after suffering a broken vertebrae when the vehicle he was riding in was ""struck from behind at high speed"" over the weekend, his spokesperson said.
According to his spokesperson, Michael Ragusa, Giuliani suffered ""fractured thoracic vertebrae, multiple lacerations and contusions, as well as injuries to his left arm and lower leg."" The crash occurred Saturday night.
Giuliani's associate Ted Goodman said Tuesday that Giuliani had been discharged from the hospital.
Giuliani and Goodman were driving southbound on Interstate 93 in Manchester when they were flagged down by a woman on the side of the road who said she was the victim of domestic violence, according to New Hampshire State Police and Ragusa.
Ragusa said Giuliani ""rendered assistance,"" contacted 911 and ""remained on scene with her until responding officers arrived to ensure her safety.""
After speaking with New Hampshire State Police troopers, Giuliani and Goodman got back on the road and turned around to go northbound, police said. They were then hit by a car almost directly across the road from where the troopers were, police said.
A Honda driven by a woman identified as 19-year-old Lauren Kemp hit the back of the Ford that Giuliani was riding in, which was being driven by Goodman, according to state police. All three were taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Both vehicles were ""heavily damaged,"" police said. Police do not believe Kemp has any connection to the initial domestic violence incident that was reported.
Giuliani's son, Andrew, who is the head of the White House's FIFA World Cup 2026 Task Force, thanked people who have reached out after the crash.
""As a son, I can tell you I'm honored to have a Dad that I can call the toughest SOB I've ever seen!"" heposted on social media.
Giuliani rose to fame in the 1980s and '90s in New York City as a prosecutor before being elected mayor. After two terms as mayor, he dabbled in national politics, even running for president in 2008. Later, he became a close adviser to President Trump in his first term and became a key spreader of conspiracy theories targeting the ballot counters after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 election.
Giuliani wasdisbarred in New York and Washington, D.C. and hedeclared bankruptcyafter being found liable for $148 million for spreading falsehoods about Georgia election workers.

A so-called “missing minute” of CCTV footage, a key ingredient of conspiracy theories surrounding the prison death of the sex offenderJeffrey Epstein, has been found, contradicting the assertion ofPam Bondi, the attorney general, that it was recorded over.
The video was in a cache of material, including 33,000 pages of records relating to the disgraced financier and formerDonald Trumpassociate,released late on Tuesdayby the US House oversight committee. The panel has been looking into Epstein’s August 2019 death at Manhattan’s Metropolitan correctional center.
In July, the same month as a government review confirmed Epsteindied by suicide, the FBI releasedhours of surveillance footagetaken from outside Epstein’s jail cell on the night he died. Observers quickly realized from time stamps that a block of one minute, from 11.59pm to midnight on 10 August, was not there.
Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at 6.30am.
Conspiracy theoristsleapt on the developmentas “proof” there was something suspicious about Epstein’s death, fuelled by Bondi’s insistence at the time that the prison’s CCTV system was routinely reset every 24 hours. That, she told a cabinet meeting on 8 July, meant every night’s footage would feature a “missing” minute.
ButCBS reportedlater that month that there was no blackout in the recording, and that the justice department, bureau of prisons, and the FBI had a full version including the previously unaccounted for 60 seconds.
The revelation was supported by Tuesday night’s congressional release that included the footage among two hours of previously unseen video. It reveals nothing out of the ordinary, with a handful of guards working outside the cell.
Other images not seen before,according to CBS, include Epstein being escorted by guards through the facility to make a phone call.
There was no immediate response on Wednesday from Bondi’s office or theFBI.
Most of the files released on Tuesday andposted online to Google Drivecontain information already publicly known or available. Many are image files of court documents relating to Epstein and his former girlfriend and accompliceGhislaine Maxwell, who was sentenced to a 20-year prison term in 2022 for sex-trafficking crimes.
Maxwellmet with justice department officialsat least twice in recent weeks and is, according to critics, pressing the Trump administration for a pardon.
Also featured in Tuesday’s release are what appears to be body-cam footage from police searches and police interviews. An estimated 97% of the material is not new.
The release came as Trump faces renewed scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein, a longtime friend who was part of the president’s wealthy network of associates in Palm Beach, Florida, and New York.
A number of Republicans joined Democrats in demanding more transparency from theTrump administrationover the case, and the release of all documents related to it, amplified by this week’s return of lawmakers to Washington DC after the summer recess.
The controversy has caused a rare split in Republican ranks with many still fiercely loyal to Trump, and others critical of what they see as the administration’s secretive approach.
Congressman Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, joined Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, in filing a discharge petition in the House this week that would force the release of all of the Epstein files.
The House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has insisted his party is committed to transparency and justice, but has called Massie’s efforts to secure the records “meaningless” and urged colleagues not to support them.
Massie hit back on Tuesday,telling Fox News Digital: “He is afraid of President Donald Trump. Mike Johnson’s speakership just hangs on that thread.”
A number of Epstein’s victims were joining other survivors of sexual abuse at a rally and press conference in Washington DC on Wednesday to demand justice, some speaking publicly for the first time."

Federal health officials are warning that certain lots of raw cat food may be contaminatedwith H5N1 bird fluafter a pet cat in San Francisco that ate the food became infected with the virus and had to be euthanized.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administrationsaid Wednesdaythat two lots of RAWR Raw Cat Food Chicken Eats tested positive for the virus. Analysis by San Francisco health department officials showed that the same strain of the H5N1 virus was present in the pet food and in the cat that died.
The incident is the first reported case of an H5N1 infection from raw food in pet catssince March.Dozens of domestic cats, includingnearly 70 this year, have been infected with H5N1, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Many of the animals became infected after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with the virus.
The affected lots of RAWR food include CCS 25 077, with a sell-by date of Sept. 18, 2026, and CCS 250 093, with a sell-by date of Oct. 3, 2026. RAWR raw pet food is sold frozen and must be thawed before use. No recall was posted for the products, but representatives for the Grass Valley, California, company said they had removed the lots in question from circulation weeks ago.
RAWR Raw Cat Food Chicken Eats are sold in frozen 2.5-pound resealable bags containing 40 1-ounce sliders of food. The product is sold in stores nationwide and online.
The U.S. Agriculture Department’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the virus in samples from the food and the cat. Genetic sequencing showed that they contained a virus lineage that was detected in November and December and is no longer circulating. The virus is the same type that has been circulating widely in birds and in U.S. dairy cattle, including those in California.
H5N1 infections can cause illness and death in birds, poultry and mammals such as cats. The virus has not been detected in dogs in the U.S., but there have been fatal cases in other countries. Animals that are very young, very old or have weakened immune systems are at risk of becoming seriously ill from an infection.
No human infections from H5N1 bird flu have been identified in people who handled raw pet food, but humans can become infected and sick if active virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth.

NEW YORK (AP) — Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.
The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.
The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.
“As best as we can tell, it’s the largest copyright recovery ever,” said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. “It is the first of its kind in the AI era.”
A trio of authors — thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson —sued last yearand now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.

A federal judge dealt the case amixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn’t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.
If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.
“We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,” said Thomas Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.
Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, “will resolve the plaintiffs’ remaining legacy claims.”
“We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,” said Aparna Sridhar, the company’s deputy general counsel.
As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.
Books are knownto be important sources of data — in essence, billions of words carefully strung together — that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic’s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
Alsup’s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it “knew had been pirated.” It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.
Debut thriller novel “The Lost Night” by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.

Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.
The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected “damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher” if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement’s higher award — approximately $3,000 per work — likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.
On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement “an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors’ works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.”
The Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren’t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.
“On the one hand, it’s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,” said Thomas Heldrup, the group’s head of content protection and enforcement.
On the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.
“It is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,” Heldrup said.
The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.
Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.
The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit byauthors and newspapers against OpenAIand its business partner Microsoft, andcases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.
“This indicates that maybe for other cases, it’s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,” said Long, the legal analyst.
The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup’s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as “fair use” under U.S. copyright law because it was “quintessentially transformative.”
Comparing the AI model to “any reader aspiring to be a writer,” Alsup wrote that Anthropic “trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them — but to turn a hard corner and create something different.”
But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees’ internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weatheredyears of copyright battles.
With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn’t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.

A Long Island man is facing charges after allegedly selling bogus Nintendo products in a years-long scheme that made him over $2 million.
Isaac Lapidus, 34, of Lawrence, was arraigned on Wednesday in a Nassau County district court on charges of trademark counterfeiting and conspiracy. He pleaded not guilty and was released to pre-trial services, the Nassau County District Attorney’s Office said in anews release.
It's not clear if he has obtained an attorney.
District Attorney Anne T. Donnelly alleged that Lapidus sold ""hundreds of thousands of counterfeit Nintendo accessories for popular consoles and games"" through Amazon. He allegedly kept the phony items in an Island Park warehouse, she said.
The scheme was uncovered after Amazon and Nintendo learned that fake products were being sold through five Amazon seller accounts. An investigation found that the five seller accounts were connected to Lapidus, according to the release.
Between October 2018 and September 2025, Lapidus allegedly sold more than 200,000 faux Nintendo Switch docking stations, 10,000 docking station adapters, and about 15,705 Pokémon Go Plus accessories, the press release said. The district attorney’s office alleged that the gross sales totaled more than $2 million.
“Despite consumer complaints about imitation products in their reviews, sales totaled into the millions of dollars,” Donnelly said. “Counterfeit products are not just bad for business; they can also be dangerous for consumers, especially when electronics are involved.”
A search warrant was executed at the Island Park warehouse, where authorities recovered 46 boxes of Nintendo Switch docking stations and power adapter sets, 23 boxes of Nintendo Cool Baby HD video game sets, and 33 boxes of Nintendo Pokémon Plus Go accessories. The district attorney’s office said Amazon determined all of the items to be counterfeit.

Business live – latest updates
Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to overturn a lower court decision that most of hissweeping trade tariffswere illegal.
The US president filed a petition late on Wednesday to ask for a review of last week’s federal appeals court ruling in Washington DC, which centred on his“liberation day” border taxesintroduced on 2 April that imposed levies of between 10% and 50% on most US imports and sent shock waves through global trade and markets.
The court found in a 7-4 ruling last Friday that Trumpoverstepped his presidential powerswhen he invoked a 1977 law designed to address national emergencies to justify his “reciprocal” tariffs.
The decision was the biggest blow yet to Trump’s tariff policies but the levies were left in place until 14 October, giving the administration time to ask the supreme court to review the decision.
Trump has now appealed and the supreme court is expected to review the case, although the justices must still agree to do so. The administration asked for that decision to be made by 10 September.
The appeal calls for an accelerated schedule with arguments being heard by 10 November, according to filings seen by Bloomberg. Justices could then rule by the end of the year.
The ruling that the tariffs were unlawful upheld a previous decision by theUS court of international trade.
The federal appeals court said last Friday that US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties or the like, or the power to tax”.
It said many of Trump’s steep tariffs were “unbounded in scope, amount and duration” and “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration has leaned on.
The president swiftly hit back. “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

On Tuesday he called for an “expedited ruling” from the supreme court. Addressing reporters at the White House, Trump claimed the US “could end up being a third-world country” without tariffs.
A defeat for Trump’s levies would at least halve the current average US effective tariff rate of 16.3%, and could force the US to pay back tens of billions of dollars, according to Chris Kennedy, an analyst at BloombergEconomics. It could also derail the preliminary trade deals the president has struck with some countries, including the UK and the EU.
Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress, but Trump claims he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency.
Earlier this week, the US clothing brand Levi’s said “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies”could drive British shoppers awayfrom its denim. Other brands, such as Tesla, have also suffered in Europe and in Canada, while protests against US goods have led to a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s whiskey."

Charles Hermeswas arrested on Jan. 28when he clapped for a speaker, after County Judge Tim O’Hare warned him not to clap. He fell to the floor as sheriff’s deputies moved in on him, and they carried him out by his wrists and ankles.
Hermes was charged with hindering proceedings by disorderly conduct, a high-level misdemeanor that can be punished with up to a year in jail and a $4,000 fine. The case was dismissed in July, but Hermes’ attorney,Mark Streiff, said in an interview Thursday he's still concerned about free speech at county meetings.
“Tim O'Hare and some of the commissioners, they don't like being called out for what they're doing by their constituents,” he said.
The court was debatingnew rules of decorumat the Jan. 28 meeting where Hermes was arrested. The new rules came after meetings full ofexpulsionsandarrests. O’Hare — who is in charge of enforcing commissioners court rules — has said he’s trying to run fair, civil meetings.
Prosecutors agreed to drop Hermes' case in exchange for Hermes taking an online class about impulse control and making a charitable donation, Streiff said.
""It's what we call a conditional dismissal,” he said. “It's when the state is of the opinion it doesn't really need to go to trial. It's not, like, such a heinous case that there needs to be a strong prosecution of it.”
KERA News reached out to Hermes and the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office for comment and will update the story if they respond.
Carolyn “Carolina” Rodriguez, a local YouTuber who films interactions with police, was also arrested at the Jan. 28 meeting, after she cussed and shouted.
Her case went to trial, where Tarrant County prosecutor Lloyd Whelchel argued the commissioners court is allowed to enforce rules of decorum, and that Rodriguez is a sensationalist who wants views. Streiff – who also represented Rodriguez – said his client was being penalized for cussing, a free speech issue.
Judge Brian Bolton ruled Rodriguez's case didn't involve free speech. The jury convicted herand sentenced her to probation.
CJ Grisham, an attorney and Second Amendment activist, was also thrown out of the January 28 meeting for cussing, but he was not arrested. Hefiled a lawsuit against county officialsfor that expulsion and another one on Jan. 14.
Hermes has been arrested twice for disruptions at Tarrant County Commissioners Court meetings. He was alsoarrested at a pro-Palestine protestat the University of Texas at Arlington, where he taught for years. UTA placed him on administrative leave in March, citing student complaints, but Hermes refuted that, sharing a positive employee reviewwith the Fort Worth Report.

An hourslong lockdown of the campus of UMass Lowell is over Wednesday afternoon, after a person was reported with what is suspected to be a gun, officials said.
Stream NBC10 Boston news for free, 24/7, wherever you are.
A message sent to the campus community said law enforcement believes the person left the area, though officers were being kept at residence halls overnight amid a large police presence on campus.
""Lockdown and shelter in place orders have been lifted for all UMass Lowell campuses. Based on a search and investigation, law enforcement partners believe the suspect is no longer in the vicinity. A large police presence is being maintained on campus, and officers will be stationed at all residence halls overnight,"" the alert said.
Lowell and state police acknowledged as they investigated what happened a video circulating online that appears to show someone with a weapon walking near the Riverview Suites residence hall.
Lowell police noted that there was no evidence of any gunshots being fired, echoing a line in analert on UMass Lowell's websitethat said, ""There was no report of a shooting.""
The campus was locked down for more than two hours — all on the first day of classes at the university. UMass Lowell classes and events were canceled as members of the community were told to shelter in place.
""To be clear: At no time was this an active shooter incident, and we've received no reports of a shooting or of any injuries,"" UMass Lowell Police Chief Ron Dickerson said in a statement. ""We continue to investigate this incident and are actively working to locate this individual.""
Dickerson said that there is still a large police presence at the school, and that counseling sessions would be issued across campus Wednesday and Thursday.
A massive police investigation could be seen on campus Wednesday — the FBI, ATF, a SWAT team, drones and police dogs were all part of the response, according to Lowell police, who asked anyone with information to call 978-937-3200.
UMass Lowell freshman Christopher Haverty, who was in his first day of college, was in class when he received the emergency alert.
""In criminology class — learning about stuff like mass shooters, basically,"" he said. ""I was learning about this stuff, and then we got the announcement.""
""It's sort of one of those things where you never think it'll happen to you until -- here we are, getting a notification on our phone,"" said senior Andrew Fenner.
Police said they received the report of a person who might be armed just before 2:30 p.m. When they got to the scene, they obtained the video appearing to show the person with the weapon.
Police haven't shared more information about the video — NBC10 Boston was working to authenticate video circulating online. Students are reacting to that footage.
""It was pretty scary when he was just walking up and knowing that he could potentially shoot someone,"" Haverty said.
Senior Nadim Chowdhury said he was with friends in a dorm getting ready for class when one of his friends saw someone walking around with a gun.
""At first, I didn't think much of it,"" he said. ""Then we got the phone alert from the campus.""
UMass Lowell initially issued alerts about an individual who may have a weapon on campus. The alerts sent to the community referred to a search for a person with a weapon near the South Campus dormitory. The public was urged to avoid the area as police investigated.
""Then we saw the video of him, and then we were like, 'Oh, shoot, we just saw this guy,'"" Chowdhury said.
Students told NBC10 Boston about 100 people were packed into a room during the lockdown, looking at updates and texting friends who were in the area near where the man was reportedly seen.
""There were a couple who were more emotional than others,"" said sophomore Dante Castellano.
One of the calmer students there was 31-year-old Army veteran Justin Ford, a junior at UMass Lowell. He was communicating with NBC10 Boston during the lockdown, and we caught up with him after it was lifted.
""I just remembered my training,"" he said. ""Best thing to do is cover the windows, barricade the doors, we've got to stay quiet, we've got to stay low. I said if we hear someone in the hallways, just keep quiet.""
Ford said that at one point, someone wanted to leave the classroom, and he asked them to stay inside for the safety of everyone else.
Rep. Lori Trahan shared a statement on social media saying she was monitoring the situation: ""I'm actively monitoring the alert of a potentially armed individual near UMass Lowell’s South Campus and in touch with local officials. If you are in Lowell, please follow directions from Lowell Police Department (Official) and UMass Lowell."""
reddit,r/news/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jzlgj915no,t3_1n7onwh,Three dead after Lisbon historic funicular railway derails,TheGreatDaiamid,2025-09-03 19:37:45,862,44,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Portugal's Prime Minister Luís Montenegro has called a furcular train crash that killed 16 people as ""one of the biggest human tragedies of our recent history"".
Lisbon's 140-year-old Glória funicular, which is popular with tourists, derailed and crashed into a building at around 18:15 local time (17:15 GMT) on Wednesday.
More than 20 others were injured, five of whom were in a serious condition, the prime minister added.
The head of the Portuguese capital's public transport operator, Carris, said all funiculars in the capital were now being inspected and that it had launched an independent investigation into the incident.
A day of mourning is being observed across Portugal on Thursday.
Footage shared on social media showed the crumpled yellow funicular overturned on the cobblestone street and people running from the area as smoke filled the air.
Several passengers trapped in the wreckage had to be freed by emergency responders, local authorities said.
Officials in Lisbon had initially put the death toll at 17, however that number was later revised down to 16 after they discovered a person who died in hospital overnight had been counted twice.
Amongthe victimswas André Jorge Gonçalves Marques, who worked as a break guard on the funicular.
Carris described him as a ""dedicated, kind and happy professional, always willing to contribute to the greater good"".
Another victim has been named as former volleyball referee Pedro Manuel Alves Trindade. The Portuguese volleyball federation said it was ""deeply saddened by the tragedy"".
Officials have not indicated what may have caused the crash, but eyewitness reports suggested that the braking system on the cable-hauled funicular failed, sending it hurtling down the steep street.
A witness told Portuguese TV channel SIC that the funicular, which can carry around 40 people, ""hit a building with brutal force and collapsed like a cardboard box; it had no brakes"".
It is not known how many passengers were on board when the crash happened.
Portuguese newspaper Observador reported that a cable came loose along the railway's route, causing it to lose control and collide with a nearby building.
One witness told Observador that the vehicle was ""out of control, without brakes"".
""We all started running away because we thought [the carriage] was going to hit the one below,"" said Teresa d'Avó.
""But it fell around the bend and crashed into a building.""
An investigation has now been launched by Lisbon prosecutors, police and the transport accident investigation department.
Pedro Gonçalo de Brito Aleixo Bogas, the head of Carris, told a news conference on Thursday that all of its funiculars and its vertical lifts in the capital had been shut down for technical inspections, which would happen ""in the coming days"".
The funiculars had been operating correctly since 2007, Dr De Brito Bogas said.
He said the company had increased its spending on maintenance, but added that the cost of maintaining the funiculars had more than doubled over the past 10 years.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sent her condolences to the families of the victims, while Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez also sent their sympathy.
Sánchez said he was ""appalled by the terrible accident"".
Flags at the European Parliament in Brussels have been flying at half-mast.
A funicular is a type of railway system that allows travel up and down steep slopes.
The two cars on the Glória funicular are powered by electric motors. They are attached to opposite ends of a haulage cable, meaning that as one travels downhill, its weight lifts the other, allowing them to ascend and descend simultaneously.
The bright yellow Glória funicular is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Lisbon. It was opened in 1885 and electrified three decades later.
The historic vehicles are a crucial part of a city as hilly as Lisbon. They snake their way up many of the cobbled streets.
The one that crashed travels some 275m (900ft) from Restauradores Square in downtown Lisbon up to Bairro Alto - or high neighbourhood - taking just three minutes to make the journey.

The rest of the mechanism worked properly, says a preliminary statement into the crash which killed 16 people.
Kayleigh Smith and partner Will Nelson described as ""selfless"" and ""caring"" .
By the time Sonia Silva arrived at the stop, the funicular had crashed and her friend Sandra was dead.
At least 16 people died after a carriage on the city's famous Glória hillside railway derailed.
It is unclear what caused the crash in which 16 people died and more than 20 were injured, including many foreign nationals.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said Monday he will award former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, two days after his longtime political ally wasseriously injured in a car crash.
The decision places the award on a man once lauded for leading New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and latersanctioned by courts and disbarredfor amplifying false claims about the 2020 election. Giuliani was also criminally charged in two states; he has denied wrongdoing.
Trump in a statement on social media called Giuliani the “greatest Mayor in the history of New York City, and an equally great American Patriot.”
For much of the past two decades, Giuliani’s public life has been defined by a striking rise and fall. After leading New York through the aftermath of Sept. 11, he mounted a brief campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and became one of the most recognizable political figures in the country. But as Trump’s personal lawyer, he became a central figure in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Courts repeatedly rejected the fraud claims he advanced, and two former Georgia election workerswon a $148 million defamation judgmentagainst him.
The election workers, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, said Giuliani’s efforts to promote Trump’s lies about the election being stolen led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.
Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington for repeatedly making false statements about the election, and he was criminally charged inGeorgiaandArizonain connection with efforts to undo Trump’s loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Giuliani, 81, was hospitalized after the Saturday night collision in New Hampshire. State police said he was a passenger in a rented Ford Bronco driven by his spokesperson, Ted Goodman, when the vehicle was struck from behind by a Honda HR-V. Giuliani suffered a fractured thoracic vertebra along with multiple lacerations, contusions and injuries to his left arm and leg, according to his security chief, Michael Ragusa. On Monday, Ragusa said Giuliani remained in the hospital but was expected to be released “soon.”
The Medal of Freedom, established in 1963, is awarded to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural or other significant public endeavors.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/trump-immigration-ice-israeli-spyware,t3_1n6qv5w,Ice obtains access to Israeli-made spyware that can hack phones and encrypted apps,Face2FaceRecs,2025-09-02 18:07:29,6886,311,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Trump administration contract with Paragon Solutions gives immigration agency access to one of the most powerful stealth cyberweapons
US immigrationagents will have access to one of the world’s most sophisticated hacking tools after a decision by theTrump administrationto move ahead with a contract with Paragon Solutions, a company founded in Israel which makes spyware that can be used to hack into any mobile phone – including encrypted applications.
The Department of Homeland Security first entered into a contract with Paragon, now owned by a US firm,in late 2024, under the Biden administration. But the $2m contract was put on hold pending a compliance review to make sure it adhered to an executive order that restricts the US government’s use of spyware, Wired reported at the time.
That pause has now been lifted, according topublic procurement documents, which list USImmigration and Customs Enforcement(Ice) as the contracting agency.
It means that one of the most powerful stealth cyber-weapons ever created – which was produced outside the US – is now in the hands of an agency that has repeatedly been accused by civil and human rights groups of violating people’s due process rights.
The story was first reported by the journalist Jack Poulson on hisAll-Source Intelligence Substack newsletter.
NeitherParagonnor Ice immediately responded to a request for comment.
When it is successfully deployed against a target, the hacking software – called Graphite – can hack into any phone. By essentially taking control of the mobile phone, the user – in this case, Ice – can not only track an individual’s whereabouts, read their messages, look at their photographs, but also open and read information held on encrypted applications, like WhatsApp or Signal. Spyware like Graphite can also be used as a listening device, through the manipulation of the phone’s recorder.
Anexecutive order signed by the Biden administrationsought to establish some guardrails around the US government’s use of spyware. It said that the US “shall not make operational use of commercial spyware that poses significant counterintelligence or security risks to the United States government or significant risks of improper use by a foreign government or foreign person”. The Biden administration also took the extraordinary step ofplacing one of Paragon’s rival spyware makers, NSO Group, on a commerce department blacklist, saying the company had knowingly supplied foreign governments to “maliciously target” the phones of dissidents, human rights activists and journalists.
Paragon has sought to differentiate itself from NSO Group. It has said that, unlike NSO – which previously sold its spyware to Saudi Arabia and other regimes – that it only does business with democracies. It has also said it has a no tolerance policy and will cut off government clients who use the spyware to target members of civil society, such as journalists. Paragon refuses to disclose who its clients are and has said it does not have insight into how its clients use the technology against targets.
Spyware makers like Paragon and NSO have said their products are intended to be used to prevent crime and terrorist attacks. But both companies’ software has been used in the past to target innocent people, including individuals who have been perceived to be government enemies.
John Scott-Railton, a senior research at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto, who is one of the world’s leading experts on cases in whichspyware like Graphite has been abused by governments, said in a statement that such tools “were designed for dictatorships, not democracies built on liberty and protection of individual rights”.
“Invasive, secret hacking power is corrupting. That’s why there’s a growing pile of spyware scandals in democracies, including with Paragon’s Graphite,” he said, referring to a controversy in Italy that erupted late last year.
Paragon broke off its ties with Italy after it was revealed that90 people, including journalists and members of civil society,in two dozen countries, had been targeted with the spyware. The individuals who were targeted by the Italian government included human rights activists who have been critical of Italy’s dealings with Libya. Several journalists were also targeted, though it is still unclear who ordered those hacking attacks.
The US government has in the past resisted using spyware technology made outside the US because of concerns that any company that sells technology to multiple government agencies around the world represents a potential security risk.
“As long as the same mercenary spyware tech is going to multiple governments, there is a baked-in counterintelligence risk. Since all of them now know what secret surveillance tech the US is using, and would have special insights on how to detect it and track what the US is doing with it,” Scott-Railton said. “Short of Paragon cancelling all foreign contracts, I’m not sure how this goes away.”
Nadine Farid Johnson, policy director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, which is dedicated to free speech advocacy, said news of the Ice contract compounded civil liberty concerns surrounding the “rapid and dramatic expansion of Ice’s budget and authority”. She also called on Congress to step in and limit the circumstances in which spyware could be deployed.
“Spyware like Paragon’s Graphite poses a profound threat to free speech and privacy,” Farid Johnson said. “It has already been used against journalists, human rights advocates and political dissidents around the world. The quiet lifting of the stop work order also raises the troubling prospect that parts of the executive branch are acting without adherence to the government’s own vetting requirements.”

For millennia humans have tried to scare wolves away from their livestock. Most of them didn’t have drones.
But a team of biologists working near the California-Oregon border do, and they’re using them to blastAC/DC’s“Thunderstruck,” movie clips and live human voices at the apex predators to shoo them away from cattle in an ongoing experiment.
“I am not putting up with this anymore!” actor Scarlett Johansson yells in one clip, from the 2019 film “Marriage Story.”
“With what? I can’t talk to people?” co-star Adam Driver shouts back.
Gray wolves were hunted nearly to extinction throughout the U.S. West by the first half of the 20th century. Since their reintroduction in Idaho and at Yellowstone National Park in the mid-1990s, they’ve proliferated to the point that a population in the Northern Rockies has been removed from the endangered species list.
There are now hundreds of wolves in Washington and Oregon, dozens morein northern California, andthousands roamingnear the Great Lakes.
The recovering population has meant increasing conflict with ranchers — and increasingly creative efforts by the latter to protect livestock. They’ve turned to electrified fencing,wolf alarms, guard dogs, horsebackpatrols,trapping and relocating, and now drones. In some areas where nonlethal efforts have failed, officials routinely approvekilling wolves, including last week inWashington state.
Gray wolves killed some 800 domesticated animals across 10 states in 2022, a previousAssociated Press reviewof data from state and federal agencies found.
Scientists with the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service developed the techniques for hazing wolves by drone while monitoring them using thermal imaging cameras at night, when the predators are most active. A preliminary study released in 2022 demonstrated that adding human voices through a loudspeaker rigged onto a drone can freak them out.
The team documented successful interruptions of wolf hunts. When Dustin Ranglack, the USDA’s lead researcher on the project, saw one for the first time, he smiled from ear to ear.
“If we could reduce those negative impacts of wolves, that is going to be more likely to lead to a situation where we have coexistence,” Ranglack said.
The preloaded clips include recordings of music, gunshots, fireworks and voices. A drone pilot starts by playing three clips chosen at random, such as the “Marriage Story” scene or “Thunderstruck,” with its screams and hair-raising electric guitar licks.
If those don’t work, the operator can improvise by yelling through a microphone or playing a different clip that’s not among the randomized presets. One favorite is the heavy metal bandFive Finger Death Punch‘s cover of “Blue on Black,” which might blast the lyric “You turned and you ran” as the wolves flee.
USDA drone pilots have continued cattle protection patrols this summer while researching wolf responses at ranches with high conflict levels along the Oregon-California border. Patrols extended south to the Sierra Valley in August for the first time, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
It’s unclear whether the wolves might become accustomed to the drones. Herders and wolf hunters in Europe have long deterred them with long lines hung with flapping cloth, but the wolves can eventually learn that the flags are not a threat.
Environmental advocates are optimistic about drones, though, because they allow for scaring wolves in different ways, in different places.
“Wolves are frightened of novel things,” said Amaroq Weiss, a wolf advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. “I know that in the human imagination, people think of wolves as big, scary critters that are scared of nothing.”
There are also drawbacks to the technology. A drone with night vision and a loudspeaker costs around $20,000, requires professional training and doesn’t work well in wooded areas, making it impractical for many ranchers.
Ranchers in Northern California who have hosted USDA drone patrols agree that they have reduced livestock deaths so far.
“I’m very appreciative of what they did. But I don’t think it’s a long-term solution,” said Mary Rickert, the owner of a cattle ranch north of Mount Shasta. “What I’m afraid of is that after some period of time, that all of a sudden they go, ‘Wow, this isn’t going to hurt me. It just makes a lot of noise.’”
Ranchers are compensated if they can prove that a wolf killed their livestock. But there are uncompensated costs of having stressed-out cows, such as lower birth rates and tougher meat.
Rickert said if the drones don’t work over the long term, she might have to close the business, which she’s been involved in since at least the 1980s. She wants permission to shoot wolves if they’re attacking her animals or if they come onto her property after a certain number of attacks.
If the technology proves effective and costs come down, someday ranchers might merely have to ask the wolves to go away.
Oregon-based Paul Wolf — yes, Wolf — is the USDA’s southwest district supervisor and the main Five Finger Death Punch fan among the drone pilots. He recalled an early encounter during which a wolf at first merely seemed curious at the sight of a drone, until the pilot talked to it through the speaker.
“He said, ‘Hey wolf — get out of here,’” Wolf said. “The wolf immediately lets go of the cattle and runs away.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain more seats in the 2026 midterm elections
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo (AP) — Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said Friday that he is calling Missouri lawmakers into a special session to redraw the state’s U.S. House districts as part of a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking an edge in next year’s congressional elections.
Kehoe made the announcement just hours after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a newcongressional voting mapdesigned to help Republicans gain five more seats in the 2026 midterm elections. It marked a win for President Donald Trump, who has been urging Republican-led states to reshape district lines to give the party a better shot at retaining control of the House.
Missouri is the third state to pursue an unusual mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage.Republican-led Texastook up the task first but was quickly countered byDemocratic-led California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more seats.
Kehoe scheduled Missouri’s special session to begin Sept. 3. He released a proposed new map that targets Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver’s Kansas City-area district by stretching it eastward into rural Republican-leaning areas.

His agenda also includes another Republican priority — a proposed constitutional amendment that would make it harder to approve citizen-initiated ballot measures, such as abortion-rights and marijuana legalization amendments adopted in recent years.

Kehoe cast both items as a defense against liberal politicians and activists.
“Missouri’s conservative, common-sense values should be truly represented at all levels of government,” he said in a statement.
Democrats were quick to express outrage. Missouri state House Minority Leader Ashley Aune called Kehoe a “Trump puppet” attempting to “steal a congressional seat for Republicans” and gut the ballot initiative process.
It “marks the worst threat to the integrity of our state government since pro-slavery lawmakers voted for Missouri to join the Confederacy in 1861,” Aune said in a statement.
Missouri is represented in the U.S. House by six Republicans and two Democrats — Cleaver and Rep. Wesley Bell in St. Louis.
Cleaver called the proposed redistricting an attack on democracy perpetrated by Trump.
“This attempt to gerrymander Missouri will not simply change district lines, it will silence voices. It will deny representation,” Cleaver said in a statement while vowing not to concede the seat.
Missouri Democrats have little ability to prevent Republican lawmakers from enacting a new map. Unlike in Texas, where Democratsleft the statefor two weeks to delay a vote, Missouri Democrats’ absence would not prevent a quorum for business. And although Democrats could filibuster in the Senate, Republicans could use procedural maneuvers to shut that down, as they did earlier this year to pass a proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortion.
Republicans won a 220-215 House majority over Democrats in 2024, an outcome that aligned almost perfectly with the share of the vote won by the two parties in districts across the U.S., according toa recent Associated Press analysis. Although the overall outcome was close to neutral, the AP’s analysis shows that Democrats and Republicans each benefited from advantages in particular states stemming from the way districts were drawn.

Sarah Eckhardt, D-Austin, asks questions about the proposed redistricting map, specifically the placements of Austin suburbs Cedar Park, Round Rock and Pflugerville as the Texas Senate prepares to take a vote on the redistricting bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives, Aug. 22, 2025.

Democrats would need to net three seats in next year’s election to take control of the chamber. The incumbent president’s party tends to lose seats in the midterm elections, as was the case for Trump in 2018, when Democrats won control of the House and subsequently launched investigations of Trump. Seeking to avoid a similar situation in his second term, Trump has urged Republican-led states to fortify their congressional seats.
In Texas, Republicans already hold 25 of the 38 congressional seats.
“Texas is now more red in the United States Congress,” Abbott said in a video he posted on X of him signing the legislation.
Newsom, who has emerged asa leading adversaryof Trump on redistricting and other issues, tauntingly labeled Abbotton Xas the president’s “#1 lapdog” following the signing. Democrats already hold 43 of California’s 52 congressional seats.
Voting rights groupsfiled a lawsuitthis week ahead of Abbott’s signing the bill, saying the new map weakens the electoral influence of Black voters. Texas Democrats have also vowed to challenge the new map in court.
Some Missouri Republicans had pushed for a map that couldgive them a 7-1 edgewhen redrawing districts after the 2020 census. But the GOP legislative majority ultimately opted against it. Some feared the more aggressive plan could be susceptible to a legal challenge and could backfire in a poor election year for Republicans by creating more competitive districts that could allow Democrats to win three seats.
Republican officialsin Florida, Indianaand elsewhere also are considering revising their U.S. House districts, as are Democratic officials in Illinois, Maryland and New York.
In Utah, a judge recently ordered the Republican-led Legislature to draw new congressional districts after finding that lawmakers had weakened and ignored an independent commission established by voters to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Republicans have won all four of Utah’s congressional seats under the map approved by lawmakers in 2021.

InfoWars founder Alex Jones, speaking in 2022, was dealt another legal setback on Wednesday. A state judge in Texas ordered Infowars' assets to be turned over to a state receiver. The proceeds will go to the families of the children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. They won a $1.3 billion defamation case against Jones after he spread bogus conspiracies about the shooting.Joe Buglewicz/Getty Imageshide caption
This time it might be for real.
Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones could soon be forced to stop airing his Infowars show and give up the company's property, including everything from desks and microphones to the Infowars brand name.
A state judge in Texas Wednesday ordered Infowars' assetsto be turned overto a newly-appointed state receiver, who will sell them to pay the families ofthe Connecticut children killedin the 2012Sandy Hook Elementary Schoolshooting. They won a $1.3 billion defamation case against Jones after he spread bogus conspiracies that the shooting never happened and the grieving families were actors. His listeners harassed the families for years.
The move paves the way for the receiver — or sheriffs — to start the process of seizing cash and property owned by Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, within days. The families, who've spent somethree years in federal bankruptcycourt trying to collect what Jones owes them, could start seeing their first payouts through the state court in weeks or months.
""The families are pleased that the court has placed InfoWars parent company into receivership, which will finally lead to accountability for Alex Jones' monstrously cruel harassment"" said Mark Bankston, one of the attorneys for the families.
Judge Maya Guerra Gamble's order in Travis County, Texas district court appointing a receiver, Gregory Milligan, may herald a quick end to Jones' long run under his Infowars brand.

Most of the Sandy Hook families still want the Infowars name and property sold tothe satirical site The Onion, which vowed to turn Infowars into a parody of itself.
Last December, a federal bankruptcy court judge in Texasstopped a saleto The Onion, saying the bankruptcy auction process was flawed. It was a win for Jones, who argued his company should have been sold to First United American Companies, which has ties to Jones and was widely expected to keep him on air.
The newly-appointed receiver has the power to ""collect all accounts receivable… change the locks to all premises at which any property is situated… access all storage facilities, safe-deposit boxes, [and] real property… and exercise control over any website [of Jones]"" according to the order. The order adds that ""any Sheriff, Constable or officer of the Peace shall assist the Receiver in carrying out his duties and exercising his powers under this Order.""
""Now that there's a receiver in place, Alex Jones is no longer going to control the Infowars brand. It's time to shut it down,"" said Avi Moshenberg, one of several attorneys for the families.
Legal experts agree, a sale to The Onion is more likely now that Infowars' fate has shifted to Texas state court.
""It's not a panacea, but it's a more favorable venue to be in,"" says Larry Ponoroff, dean and professor emeritus at Tulane Law School and a professor of legal practice at Wilmington University School of Law. ""From a creditor's point of view, you're most often better off under state law … because the state court may be able to operate with greater speed and flexibility…[and fewer] constraints than the bankruptcy judge has to deal with.
The Onion did not respond to requests for comment on its plans, but the company has previously vowed to continue trying to buy Infowars to ensure ""a positive outcome for the horror [the Sandy Hook families] endured.""
There was no immediate comment from Jones' lawyers, but Jones himself railed against the judge on his show after the hearing, accusing her of overreach, and saying her order runs afoul of federal bankruptcy court orders.
""I'm pretty pissed off and wound up,"" he said.
Jones has long cast the defamation suits as part of the ""Deep State"" attempt to ""terrorize"", ""stalk"" and ""defame"" him and his family in an attempt to shut him down.
""This fight is your fight,"" he told listeners in advance of Wednesday's hearing, as he implored them to buy his product to help him pay his legal bills. ""You are the resistance and this dog don't hunt without you.""
But one way or another, Jones insists, he will stay on air.
If Infowars' brand and property are sold, Jones could still start a new company or work for someone else. But because the bankruptcy judge ruled Jones' behavior ""willful and malicious,"" the bankruptcy will not erase Jones' debt, meaning families can keep claiming any money he makes in the future until he pays the $1.3 billion he owes them.
The Sandy Hook families sued Jones and his companies for defamation in Connecticut and Texas in 2018, after twenty young children and six educators were killed in the 2012 shooting. Jones falsely claimed the families staged their children's deaths in order to drum up support for gun control laws, and his followers stalked and tormented the families for years.
Both Jones and his businesses filed for bankruptcy, but his business's Chapter 11 protection was dismissed last year, allowing the fight over Infowars' assets to move to state court. Jones' personal assets – including real estate, cars, guns and watches will continue to be liquidated by the federal bankruptcy court.
Jones continues to appeal all the judgments against him, vowing to take the Connecticut case to the U.S. Supreme Court. He has until Sept. 5 to file his request.
He insists he doesn't have enough money to pay the families even a tiny fraction of what he owes them. But a court-appointed federal bankruptcy trustee says otherwise, accusing Jones ofhiding his assets. Even in a best-case scenario, however, families likely will collect very little of the money they are owed.

Updated on:  September 3, 2025 / 5:11 AM EDT/ CBS/AP
A painting of Gen. Robert E. Lee dressed in his Confederate uniform is back on display in the West Point's library, several years afterthe storied academy removed honors to the Civil War military leader.
There also are plans to restore a bust of Lee that had been removed from a plaza at the U.S. Military Academy, and a quote from Lee about honor that was removed from a separate plaza is now on display beneath the portrait, an Army spokesperson said Tuesday.
The items were removed to comply with a Department of Defense directive in 2022 that ordered the academy to address racial injustice and do away with installations that ""commemorate or memorialize the Confederacy.""
The Pentagon's decision to re-hang the portrait, which shows a Black man leading Lee's horse in the background, was first reported by The New York Times. It had been hanging in the library since the 1950s before it was placed it in storage.
The actions at West Point come as the Trump administration restores Confederate names and monuments that had been removed in recent years.
""At West Point, the United States Military Academy is prepared to restore historical names, artifacts, and assets to their original form and place,"" Rebecca Hodson, the Army's communications director, said in a prepared statement. ""Under this administration, we honor our history and learn from it - we don't erase it.""
President Trump issued an executive order in March titled ""Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History"" that decried efforts to reinterpret American history. The Army thenrestored the names of bases that originally honored Confederate leaders, finding service members with the same surnames to honor.
A commission created by Congress recommended in 2022 that the name and images of Confederate officers be removed from military academies. Lee graduated second in his West Point class in 1829 and later served as superintendent, and his name and image had prominent places at the academy on the Hudson River.
Congress took that action after repeated complaints by current and former enlistees and officers in nearly every branch of the armed services who described a deep-rooted culture of racism and discrimination that stubbornly festers despite repeated efforts to eradicate it.
Ty Seidule, a retired brigadier general who served as vice chair of the commission, said Lee's image shouldn't be on display because he ""chose treason"" and doesn't represent the values taught to cadets at West Point.
""It is against the motto of 'Duty, Honor, Country,'"" Seidule said. ""Robert E. Lee is the antithesis of that, because his duty and honor was for a rebellious slave republic.""
Seidule, now a history professor at Hamilton College, also questioned whether the restoration of these symbols at West Point are legal under the federal law that led to their removal.
An Army statement asserts that the law doesn't bar the restoration of Confederacy-related names, symbols, displays, monuments or paraphernalia on military property.
The naming commission said in 2022 that it wasn't created ""with any intention of 'erasing history.'""
""The facts of the past remain and the commissioners are confident the history of the Civil War will continue to be taught at all service academies with all the quality and complex detail our national past deserves,"" the commission said at the time. ""Rather, they make these recommendations to affirm West Point's long tradition of educating future generations of America's military leaders to represent the best of our national ideals.""

Updated on:  September 2, 2025 / 4:34 PM EDT/ CBS News
A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family'sWorld Liberty Financialand that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.
The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according todatafrom CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.
Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.
World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.
Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term,vowingto make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world.""
World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.
""The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. ""Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.""
In July, Mr. Trumpsigned the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for ""stablecoins,"" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.
The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.
WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.
World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: ""You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.""
The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.
""The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,"" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.""
He added, ""Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.""
World Liberty Financial also offers astablecoincalled USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.
""WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,"" Puckrin said.
That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity ""sets it apart in a crowded market,"" he said.
The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.
But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.
In May, the $TRUMP meme coindrew scrutinywhen the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.
That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.
As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.
Trump Media & Technology Group — the owner of the Truth Social app — has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about$2 billion in cryptocurrenciesto refashion the business as an investment firm.
Shares of Trump Media & Technology group have shed about 50% of their value year to date and traded Tuesday at $17.05.

Updated on:  August 28, 2025 / 7:43 AM EDT/ CBS Baltimore
A jury on Wednesday awarded Baltimore City the largest verdict ever against a Maryland ghost gun dealer.
The city was granted $62 million in damages from firearm retailer  Hanover Armory LLC, which was alleged to have contributed to violent crime in Baltimore.
Ghost gunsare unserialized and untraceable firearms often sold as kits without ID checks or background checks.
In recent years, ghost guns have been tied to school shootings and other crimes in Maryland.
Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and city leaders say Hanover Armory ""flooded the city with ghost guns"" that increased violent crime and posed a potent threat to residents.
""Baltimore has lost generations of friends, neighbors, and loved ones to gun violence,"" Mayor Scott said. ""Together, we are saying enough is enough. Today's verdict is a massive victory in Baltimore's fight against illegal ghost guns and the companies that have allowed these weapons to proliferate in our neighborhoods.""
Baltimore City filed the lawsuit against Hanover Armory, aMaryland gun shopin 2022, accusing it of illegally selling untraceable ghost guns.
Hanover Armory was accused of negligence, creating a public nuisance, and violating the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.
That lawsuit also named Polymer80, a top manufacturer of unserialized ghost guns. Baltimore reached a$1.2 million settlement with Polymer80 in February 2024.
On Wednesday, the jury determined that $62 million should be awarded to Baltimore City in a win over Hanover Armory. City leaders say that money will go toward community violence intervention groups.
""To be clear, there are legitimate businesses that sell firearms legally and respect safeguards designed to keep people safe,"" Mayor Scott said. ""Hanover is not one of them. Irresponsible companies like this one, that ignore the law in pursuit of profit, have no business operating in Baltimore—or anywhere, for that matter. We are making it clear: anyone—any company—who enables violence in our city will be held accountable.""
Maryland's state ban on ghost gunsstarted in 2022. The law makes it a misdemeanor to buy or sell unfinished gun frames and receivers. Violators face up to five years in jail and a $10,000 fine.
In 2023, Baltimore police confiscated more than 460 ghost guns. By mid-2025, the city reported seizing more than 150.
City officials say ghost guns are assembled at home and end up on the streets, often being used in violent crimes.

Kennedy Jr. made the announcement Wednesday.
In an effort led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., HHS and the Department of Education are urging schools to strengthen nutrition education across pre-med, medical school and residency programs.
Kennedy haspreviously saidhe was going to demand that medical schools teach nutrition or lose federal funding, but it was unclear fromWednesday's announcementif HHS or the Department of Education had the authority to do so.
Instead, HHS and the Department of Education asked schools to comply by providing details on their commitments within two weeks, by Sept. 8.
The announcement builds on Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" efforts to draw more attention to what he has called ""root causes"" of chronic diseases, particularly diet, lifestyle and exercise.
""With the support of Education Secretary Linda McMahon, I am calling on medical schools, residency programs, licensing boards, and assessment and accrediting bodies to overhaul their standards. They must embed rigorous, measurable nutrition education at every stage of medical training,"" Kennedy wrote in an op-ed in theWall Street JournalWednesday.
""We train physicians to wield the latest surgical tools, but not to guide patients on how to stay out of the operating room in the first place. We know that when applied properly, nutrition counseling can prevent and even reverse chronic disease,"" he wrote.
Kennedy also announced the initiative with avideo on X.
The proposed requirements would impact six areas, including pre-med courses, medical school courses, licensing examinations, residency, board certifications, and then throughout a physician’s career.
Some medical schools, including Cornell University and the University of North Carolina, have previouslytold ABC Newsthat they believe they already offer sufficient nutrition education. The Association of American Medical Colleges says that each of the more than 170 medical schools in its membership reported ""covering nutrition content in some form.""
But there have also been efforts in the medical community to create across-the-board standards for improving nutrition training in medical school – a trend that began before Kennedy took office and that's backed by nutrition experts.
Onestudy from 2015showed that medical students spend, on average, only 19 hours on required nutrition education over their four years of schooling.
And last year, doctors and professors from over 30 universitiespublishedproposed recommendations for how schools could design their national curriculums, including 36 ""nutritional competencies"" for medical students to meet – many of which mirror what Kennedy and McMahon called for on Wednesday.
""Despite the association between dietary patterns and chronic disease, there are no nationally required nutrition competencies in undergraduate medical education (UME), and such competencies are limited or completely absent from the requirements for most medical specialties in graduate medical education (GME),"" they wrote at the time in an article published in JAMA Network Open.
The effort has received bipartisan support from Washington, including a 2022 House resolution calling for more nutrition courses in medical training to combat ""the mounting personal and financial burden of diet-related disease.""
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has also given attention to the issue. In 2023, the accreditation organization hosted a summit to discuss ways to incorporate more nutrition training in undergrad and graduate school programs.
Nate Wood, a doctor at Yale Medicine who focuses on obesity medicine and nutrition science, welcomed Kennedy and McMahon's effort.
""It’s certainly true that physicians are under-trained in nutrition and don’t feel confident addressing diet with their patients. More nutrition education at all levels is sorely needed: K-12, university, medical school, and residency and fellowship training,"" he said.
But Wood cautioned that physicians alone can't fill the void in the medical system – especially when they're focused on other aspects of care.
""Many patients lack access to a registered dietitian, and physicians aren’t trained to work in concert with these nutrition experts. Interprofessional collaboration with dietitians needs to be a focus of whatever nutrition education we implement for our nation’s future physicians to ensure that patients receive team-based care in an evidence-based manner,"" Wood said.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The gun used in the lynching of 14-year-oldEmmett Tillis now on display for the public to see, 70 years after the killing.
The Mississippi Department of Archives and History unveiled the .45-caliber pistol and its holster during a news conference Thursday, which is the70th anniversary of Till’s murder.
The gun belonged to John William “J.W.” Milam who, alongside Roy Bryant, abducted Till from his great-uncle’s home on Aug. 28, 1955. The white men tortured and killed Till after the teenager was accused of whistling at a white woman in a rural Mississippi grocery store.
Till’s body was later found in the Tallahatchie River. Bryant and Milam were charged with Till’s murder, but they were acquitted by an all-white-male jury.
AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on the gun used in Emmett Till’s lynching.
Deborah Watts, the co-founder and executive director of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation and Till’s cousin, said she has mixed emotions about the weapon being on display.
“It is an emotional day for us, and I just don’t think that associating a murder weapon with the 70th anniversary is appropriate at this time,” Watts said.
Watts wants Till’s story to be preserved. However, she sees the weapon not as an artifact, but as a piece of evidence in a struggle for justice that is still ongoing.
According to a press release from MDAH, Wheeler Parker, another of Till’s cousins, who was there when Till was kidnapped, is grateful to see the artifacts in a museum for the public to see.
“I think it’s good because it brings closure,” Parker was quoted as saying. “I hope you guys can find the ring and cotton gin. Thank you for doing this.”
The gun was previously in the possession of a family in the Mississippi Delta, who donated it on the condition of anonymity. It will be displayed in the Emmett Till exhibit at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. The gun was authenticated using the serial number, which matched the one written in FBI reports on Till’s murder.
Michael Morris, the director of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History, said he hopes the anniversary will cause people to reflect on how Till’s story has impacted societal progress.
“To me, that’s the legacy. It’s not just his death. It’s the way that he still finds a way to inspire folks to be the change that they want to see in the world,” Morris said.
Till’s murder was a pivotal moment in the Civil Rights Movement. Thousands came to his funeral, and his mother, Mamie Till Mobley, insisted on an open casket so the country could see the gruesome state of her son’s body.

A federal court inArgentinahas ordered house arrest for the daughter of a former Nazi official and her husband after a raid failed to locate a painting stolen from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam.
Authorities raided a home in the coastal city of Mar del Plata last week after a Dutch newspaperidentified a paintingseen in a real estate photo as an Italian masterpiece registered on a database of lost wartime art.
They failed, however, to locate the piece.
The painting, a portrait of Contessa Colleoni by the Italian artistGiuseppe Ghislandi, who died in 1743, had been missing for 80 years, before it was identified in the listing for a home believed to be owned by Patricia Kadgien, the daughter of the late former Nazi official Friedrich Kadgien.
Patricia Kadgien and her husband were ordered to remain under house arrest for 72 hours starting Monday and will be questioned for obstructing the investigation to locate the painting, a judicial official in Mar del Plata said on Tuesday.
The couple will be summoned for a hearing before Thursday, the official said, where they are expected to be charged with “concealment of theft in the context of genocide”.
Argentina authorities carried out four new raids on Monday to find the painting, the official said, at homes linked to Kadgien and the couple’s relatives, where investigators found two other paintings that appeared to date back to the 1800s.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact Patricia Kadgien.
After the fall of the Third Reich at the end of the second world war, a number of high-ranking Nazi officials fled to South America.
The portrait of Contessa Colleoni was among more than 1,000 works of art stolen by the Nazis from the Amsterdam-based art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, who died in 1940,according tothe Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, which also reported on documents suggesting it was in the possession of Friedrich Kadgien, a senior official in Adolf Hitler’s government who moved to Argentina after the second world war. Kadgien died in 1979."

Palestinian militant group Hamas urged the United Nations to ""stop the war and lift the siege"", calling for unrestricted access for food, medicine, water and fuel.
Mr Netanyahu, whose defence minister meanwhile threatened an even more intense offensive, rejected the UN-backed report as ""an outright lie"".
The Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in the Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory, including Gaza City.
Israel has pressed ahead with plans to seize Gaza City despite an international outcry, saying that taking the territory's largest city is key to defeating Hamas.
The IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of September, covering around two-thirds of Gaza.
With the vast majority of the territory's population displaced at least once, the UN said nearly a million people currently live in the northern Gaza governorate.
UN agencies and aid groups had warned for months of a looming famine in Gaza, where Israel has severely restricted aid and at times completely cut it off during its nearly two-year war with Hamas.
COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body which oversees civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, including coordinating aid to Gaza, argued that the IPC's findings rely on ""partial data and unreliable sources"".
UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said the famine was entirely preventable, saying food could not get through to Palestinians in need ""because of systematic obstruction by Israel"".
UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a ceasefire, saying: ""We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.""
UN human rights chief Volker Türk said it was ""a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare"", a charge for which the International Criminal Court in November issued an arrest warrant for Mr Netanyahu.
In a statement, Mr Netanyahu said ""Israel does not have a policy of starvation"", citing figures on aid it had allowed into Gaza.
The IPC report said that ""over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterised by starvation, destitution and death"".
It said the deterioration between July and August was the most severe since it began analysing hunger in Gaza, driven by a sharp escalation in the war and restrictions on supplies.
In early March, Israel completely banned aid from Gaza for two months.
Watch: UN aid chief says Israel engaging in 'systemic obstruction' of food
Speaking in Geneva,Tom Fletcher said: ""It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel.""
The International Committee of the Red Cross said the famine determination ""must serve as a catalyst for immediate and concrete action"".
Britain's top diplomat David Lammy said Israel's ""refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this man-made catastrophe. This is a moral outrage.""
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz earlier warned that ""the gates of hell will open upon"" Hamas leaders, specifically in Gaza City, ""until they agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war, primarily the release of all hostages and their disarmament"".
Military chief Eyal Zamir said ""we are expanding operations in Gaza in the coming days"".
Last night, Mr Netanyahu said he had ordered negotiations aimed at freeing the hostages still held in Gaza since the Hamas attack that triggered the war, 49 people, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.
The Israeli premier said the diplomatic push would accompany the operation to take control of Gaza City.
Mediators have been waiting for an official Israeli response to their latest ceasefire proposal, which Hamas accepted earlier this week.
On the ground, Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 57 people today, more than half of them in Gaza City.
Umm Mohammed Nasr, a 42-year-old mother of four from Gaza City, said that ""the bombing hasn't stopped since this morning ... but we have no idea where to go"".

""We are dying,"" she said.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency or the Israeli military.
Hamas's October 2023 attack that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel's offensive has killed at least 62,192 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/boeing-hearing-crash-victims-1.7623812,t3_1n7f8ac,Families of airplane crash victims get chance to object to Boeing non-prosecution deal,AudibleNod,2025-09-03 13:45:07,1320,15,N/A,N/A,N/A,"A U.S. judge on Wednesday will hold a hearing on whether to approve a deal between the Justice Department and Boeing that allows the planemaker to avoid prosecution on a charge stemming from two fatal 737 Max plane crashes that killed 346 people.
Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas will consider objections from relatives of some of those killed in the crashes in Indonesia in 2018 and Ethiopia in 2019 to the agreement that enables Boeing to escape oversight from an independent monitor for three years. In the Ethiopian crash, 18 Canadian citizens were killed.
Boeing last year agreed to plead guilty under a deal with prosecutors to a criminal fraud charge that it misled U.S. regulators about a crucial flight control system on the 737 Max, its bestselling jet, but the company later reversed course.
Boeing agreed to the initial plea deal during the final months of the Biden administration.
O'Connor rejected the agreement in December, faulting a diversity and inclusion provision in the deal related to the selection of an independent monitor.
That prolonged the case into the Trump administration, which took over on Jan. 20 and overhauled the Justice Department, leading to a tentative non-prosecution agreement.
According to the Clifford Law Offices of Chicago, Chris and Clariss Moore will attend the hearing. Their adult daughter, Danielle, was killed in the Ethiopian crash.
Chris Moore characterized the non-prosecution deal in a statement as a ""ludicrous plea bargain.""
""If the court rubber-stamps the [Department of Justice] to allow Boeing's fraud and unethical behaviour causing multiple deaths to escape justice, it will foster the violation of the principles of capitalism, compliance and justice for the rich and powerful at the expense of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for the people,"" "" said Moore. ""The safety of passengers will be held in the balance.""
Some family members argue dismissal of the charge is not in the public interest, citing O'Connor's statement in 2023 that ""Boeing's crime may properly be considered the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history.""
Paul Cassell, a lawyer for some of the relatives, said the ""misleading and unfair deal is clearly against the public interest. The families will be asking Judge O'Connor to use his recognized authority to reject this inappropriate deal.""
Boeing says the executive branch solely has the power to decide whether to bring or maintain a prosecution. The planemaker has asked O'Connor to reject objections filed by families and to grant the government's motion to dismiss the criminal charge.
Under the non-prosecution agreement, Boeing agreed to pay an additional $444.5 million US into a crash victims' fund to be divided evenly per victim of the two fatal 737 Max crashes, on top of a new $243.6-million fine. Boeing was to pay $1.1 billion in total, including the fine, compensation to families and more than $455 million to strengthen the company's compliance, safety and quality programs.
The vast majority of the families have settled civil suits with Boeing and collectively have been ""paid several billion dollars,"" the Justice Department said.
Boeing has faced enhanced scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration since January 2024, when a new Max 9 missing four key bolts suffered a mid-air emergency, losing a door plug. As a result, Justice Department officials decided to reopen the older fatal crashes case and to negotiate a plea agreement with Boeing.

Anti-corruption protests escalated in Nepal's capital Kathmandu today, as government buildings were set ablaze.
The unrest was sparked by  a social media ban, which has now been reversed by the government. It has now grown into a wider anti-corruption movement that took to the streets on Monday.
In total, at least 22 people have been killed in the protests and dozens more injured.
As protests raged, Nepal's prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, resigned from his post.
Nepal's army says it is committed to taking control of the situation, but what happens next - and who will replace Oli - is still unclear.

Separately, the Area Police office for Tulsipur, in Nepal's Dang province, say 127 prisoners were able to escape from Tulsipur Jail.

Nepal's army chief has invited protestors to engage in dialogue to find a solution to the countryâs current political crisis.
In a video message released on social media, Chief of Army Staff General Ashok Raj Sigdel says the military was committed to safeguarding national unity and territorial integrity.
He says there has been huge loss of life and property during the protests so far and urged demonstrators to show restraint.
""It is our common responsibility to maintain law and order, ensure national unity and not to let additional loss of life and property,â he says.
He describes the current situation in Nepal as ""an uneasy situation"" and calls for normalising tensions.
He also expresses condolences to those who have died during the ongoing protests.

British tourists caught up in the protests in Nepal have described witnessing smoke from fires billowing in the sky and military helicopters circling overhead.
Joseph Glass, 28, a carpenter from Norfolk, said when he woke up this morning, the whole of Kathmandu had been shut down.
""Itâs a serious situation,"" Joseph tells us. ""Theyâve closed
the international airport here, so no one can leave as far as Iâm aware.
""Locals
are telling us the military are taking control now. Apart from that, thatâs all
I know. I called the British Embassy and their advice was for me to sign up to
email alerts â not very helpful when the cityâs burning around you.
""There are quite a few British nationals
here at this hostel weâre staying in, and weâre just sheltering in place at the
moment. The protesters originally went straight to the airport to block the
entrance so the ministers couldnât escape.
""Theyâre out for blood. They killed
children here and the locals want them gone â and not just gone from the
country, gone from existence.
""Itâs an incredible scene Iâm looking at
right now. From 180 degrees of my eyesight there are fires from left to right,
with military helicopters circling.""
Protests have escalated in Nepal during the second day of unrest. We're taking a moment to distil what has been happening.
Why are people protesting?
The demonstrations were triggered by the government's decision last week to ban 26 social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, for failing to meet a deadline to register.
Critics accused the government of seeking to stifle an anti-corruption campaign with the ban, which was repealed on Monday night. Protesters are also channelling a more deep-rooted dissatisfaction with the country's authorities.
Who is protesting?
This protest is unlike any seen before in Nepal. The demonstrators identify as Gen Z, and the term has become a rallying symbol throughout the movement.
Students from colleges and universities across Nepal's major cities - Kathmandu, Pokhara and Itahari - have been invited to join.
What are the demands?
Their two main demands have been clear: the government lifting the ban on social media, which has now happened, and officials putting an end to what they call ""corrupt practices"".
What has the impact been?
Anti-corruption demonstrations have turned violent in Kathmandu, and other cities in Nepal. Police in the capital city have used force, while protesters have targeted the parliament building as well as the homes of several high-ranking politicians.
At least three people are reported to have been killed on Tuesday, bringing the total to 22 since the unrest began.
Phanindra DahalBBC Nepali, reporting from Kathmandu
The Nepali Army is urging the countryâs young people to demonstrate restraint and will deliver an address to the nation later tonight.
In an earlier statement, the Nepali Army said the institution is committed to safeguarding the interest of Nepal and Nepali people.
The Army says it is closely analysing the situation and has urged protesters to not continue activities.
Earlier, President Ram Chandra Poudel appealed to the protestors - who are mostly Gen Z - to communicate and find a solution peacefully.
One more person has been killed during ongoing protests in Nepal, bringing the total to 22 including 19 killed on Monday.
The director of the Civil Service Hospital tells the BBC 209 people were admitted during Tuesday's protest.
Of these, 186 have been discharged, Dipak Poudel adds.
The head of the National Trauma Centre, Dr Badri Rijal, says nearly 40 people with injuries were brought for treatment at the hospital.

Nepal's parliament building has been set on fire, as protesters have broken in and smashed windows
In Nepal's capital Kathmandu, several locations have been targeted by anti-corruption protesters since Monday.
Fires have been started and hundreds of protesters have broken into the country'sparliament building. Graffiti and anti-corruption messages are being spray painted onto the building's exterior and windows have been smashed -here's how our reporter on the ground describes the scene.
TheSingha Durbar, a large complex in the city which houses Nepal's government offices, has similarly been stormed by crowds of protesters.
Located within this complex is theprime minister's office, which has also been targeted. As a reminder, prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, resigned earlier today following the large-scale protests.
Elsewhere, Kathmandu'sTribhuvan International Airport is closed, according to the arrivals and departures board on its website.
Anbarasan EthirajanGlobal Affairs reporter
The protests are not only unprecedented but also reflect the widespread
discontent over the political class in this Himalayan nation.
The anger against
the political leaders is evident with houses of several ministers and other
politicians being vandalised and set on fire.
Some leaders, including
ministers, have reportedly taken refuge with the security forces.
So far, the
protesters have not spelt out their demands apart from rallying under the
broader anti-corruption call. The protests appear spontaneous and there seems
to be no organised leadership.
Though the prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, has
stepped down, thereâs no immediate clarity on who will replace him or if there
any other governance structure is being proposed.
With most senior politicians
running for cover, thereâs no one in charge. The fact that security chiefs and
bureaucrats are appealing for calm indicates that political leadership has taken a
back seat.
For the moment, there seems to be a power vacuum in Nepal. If there is no government or any other interim authority soon,
then the are chances that the violence may take an ugly turn.
The Nepalese army is respected, and they could play
a role in bringing order. While they have fought a long civil war with the
Maoists they would be hesitant in managing law and order â which is essentially
the job of police and other security agencies.
But someone needs to take a lead
- now.
Unlike the uprisings in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, here people seem to be
unhappy with all the political class and for their mismanagement of the country
over the decades.
Nepal has had 14 prime ministers since 2008, when the Maoist
rebels joined the mainstream, and the country became a Republic. The continuous
political jockeying for power, with parties shifting alliances, has disappointed
many, particularly the youth.
In the absence of any leadership or authority,
whatâs going to happen in Nepal is going to be anyoneâs guess.
The priority now
is to restore order.

Weâve been verifying footage posted online during a second day of unrest in the Nepalese capital Kathmandu.
Protesters who turned out yesterday to demonstrate against a now-lifted social media ban have returned to voice their anger over claims of corruption in the country.
In one video, from Kathmandu, riot police are seen on a street full of protesters.
Using Google Maps and Street View, we could match shop fronts and business signs in the footage to find the exact location of where it was taken - in this case close to the parliament offices.
Several posts showed people gathering in the grounds of Singhadurbar, the government complex in Kathmandu, where we can see fires have been set.
Putting frames from the video through a Google reverse image search confirmed none had appeared before today and therefore the footage is new.
In a third video we saw people in the grounds of the Supreme Court of Nepal where fires had been lit and rubbish strewn across the front of the building.
The video shows the courtâs entrance and gate posts as well as the main building which can be seen on Google Street View.

Hundreds of protesters have broken into Nepalâs parliament building in Kathmandu, with smoke continuing to rise from a wing of the building.
Motorbikes are circulating around the buildingsâ compound, with some carrying dug up plants away from the garden and paintings from the interior.
Protesters are dancing and chanting slogans around a fire at the entrance of the building, many holding Nepalâs flag.
Some have entered the inside of the building  where all the windows have been smashed. Graffiti and anti-government messages have been spray painted on the buildings exterior.
One message on the building says: âyou took the wrong fight.â
Anti-corruption protesters in Nepal have breached the country's federal parliament building in Kathmandu.
Fires can be seen and smoke is rising from the building, as large crowds of protesters are gathered in the nearby vicinity.
Protesters have defied a curfew as their anger against the government following Monday's shootings has showed no signs of abating.

""It has happened now and we are more than happy to witness this and fight for this,"" she says. ""I hope this change will bring something that it positive to us.""
Shreshta thinks taxes paid by working people need to be used in ways that will help the country grow.
She adds that an important problem the country is facing is that young people are going abroad, seeking a better future.
""If we can make our country better, our youth can stay here,"" she says.
""I am hopeful that our country will change now.""

Roger Woodend, who is originally from Coleraine, Northern Ireland, but now lives in Philadelphia, says he has been told to evacuate his hotel in Kathmandu.
The 50-year-old tells us he checked in as normal and had no issues getting from Kathmandu airport to the Hilton Hotel where he was staying.
He was debating whether he would be able to go into the city, but locals told him to ""wait until we see what happens later"".
A few hours later Roger says the hotel put out a call telling guests to stay in their rooms, shut the windows and not to leave as a standoff between police and protesters started outside.
""The call came over the loudspeaker: 'everybody get out, evacuate, evacuate, evacuate - get out of the hotel,"" Roger says.
He told us he could see smoke ""everywhere"" around the hotel, as he rushed to the car park with his belongings but was locked in by a big metal gate.
Protesters managed to get the gate open and told him, and others in the car park, to get out. He says: ""The protestors formed a clear path for us â maybe 50 to 70 people â
and kept saying 'sorry, sorry, we're so sorry about this.'
""It was very scary. You hear about people
getting shot yesterday, and while youâre not a target you donât want to get
caught in crossfire.""

reddit,r/news/,https://abcnews.go.com/US/epstein-files-release-doj-oversight-committee/story?id=125198408,t3_1n6xk0v,"Thousands of Epstein-related records from DOJ released, Oversight Committee says",NewSlinger,2025-09-02 22:23:54,36667,724,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Over 33,000 pages of Epstein-related records were released, the committee said.
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said it has released tens of thousands of records related toJeffrey Epstein, provided by the Department of Justice.
""On August 5, Chairman Comer issued a subpoena for records related to Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, and the Department of Justice has indicated it will continue producing those records while ensuring the redaction of victim identities and any child sexual abuse material,"" the committee said in areleaseannouncing the release of 33,295 pages of Epstein-related records that included alinkfor where to access them.
Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee have previously said that most of the files turned over by the DOJ are already public; California Rep. Ro Khanna has said 97% are in the public domain, while 3% are new.
Rep. Robert Garcia, ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, said a new disclosure in Tuesday's release is ""less than 1,000 pages from the Customs and Border Protection's log of flight locations of the Epstein plane from 2000-2014 and forms consistent with reentry back to the U.S.""
""The 33,000 pages of Epstein documents James Comer has decided to 'release' were already mostly public information. To the American people -- don't let this fool you,"" Garcia, D-Calif., said in a statement while calling for ""real transparency.""
A review of the documents released by the committee indicates they consist of public court filings and transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial, previously released flight logs from Epstein's plane, already public Bureau of Prisons communications the night of Epstein’s death and various other public court papers from Epstein’s criminal case in Florida.
The 33,000 documents provided by the DOJ to Congress is just a fraction of the files the Department of Justice has in its possession.
The Trump administration has beendealing with the falloutfrom its decision not to release materials related to the investigation into Epstein, the wealthy financier and convicted sex offender who died by suicide in jail in 2019, following the blowback it received from MAGA supporters after it announced last month that no additional files would be released.
Epstein, whose private island estate was in the U.S. Virgin Islands, has long been rumored to have kept a ""client list"" of celebrities and politicians, which right-wing influencers have baselessly accused authorities of hiding.
The Justice Department and FBI announced in July that they hadfound no evidencethat Epstein kept a client list, after several top officials, before joining the administration, had themselves accused the government of shielding information regarding the Epstein case.
Hours before releasing the records on Tuesday, members of the House Oversight Committee had ameetingwith Epstein victims. Oversight Chair Rep. James Comer told reporters he intends to expand the scope of the investigation after hearing from the victims, including new witnesses.
""We're going to do everything we can to give the American public the transparency they seek, as well as provide accountability in memory of the victims who have already passed away, as well as those that were in the room and many others who haven't come forward,"" Comer, R-Ky., said.
Earlier on the House floor on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie formally filed a discharge petition -- a procedural tool to bypass GOP leadership and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to publicly release the Epstein files.
Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who serves on the House Oversight Committee,saidahead of the release of the Epstein-released files on Tuesday that she doesn't believe a vote to release them ""will even come to the floor being that they will all be made public.""
Though during House votes Tuesday night, Democrats were lined up on the floor to sign the discharge petition. Massie also said he still plans to move forward with it.
""I haven't had time to look at all the documents have been released by the Oversight Committee, but I think the scope of their investigation is such that the things they requested aren't even going to include all the things that we need, and the few documents that we have been able to view are heavily redacted to the degree that they wouldn't show us anything new,"" he told reporters Tuesday night.
""Somebody needs to show us what's new in those documents, to know whether it's moot or not,"" he added.

Israel launched a strike on Hamas’ leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as they discussed a U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, officials said.
DOHA, Qatar (AP) — Israel struck the headquarters of Hamas’ political leadership in Qatar on Tuesday as the group’s top figures gathered to consider a U.S. proposal fora ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The strike on the territory of a U.S. ally marked a stunning escalation and risked upending talks aimed atwinding down the warand freeing hostages.
The attack angered Qatar, an energy-rich Gulf nation hosting thousands of American troops that has served as a key mediator between Israel and Hamas throughout the 23-month-old war and even before. It condemned what it referred to as a “flagrant violation of all international laws and norms” as smoke rose over its capital, Doha. Other key U.S. allies in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, promised their support to Qatar.

Hamas said in a statement its top leaders survived the strike but that five lower-level members were killed, including the son of Khalil al-Hayya — Hamas’ leader for Gaza and its top negotiator — three bodyguards, and the head of al-Hayya’s office. Hamas, which has sometimes only confirmed the assassination of its leaders months later, offered no immediate proof that al-Hayya and other senior figures had survived.
The United States said Israel alerted it before the strike. But American officials sought to distance the U.S. from the attack. The White House said President Donald Trump believes the strike was an “unfortunate incident” that didn’t advance peace in the region. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and “made his thoughts and concerns very clear.”
She also told reporters that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff passed along a warning to the Qataris. But Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari derided the warning, saying in a post on X that it came just as “the explosions from the Israeli strikes were being heard.”
Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, lashed out at Netanyahu for “dragging the region to a place where it unfortunately cannot be repaired.”
Asked at a news conference if cease-fire talks would continue, Sheikh Mohammed said that after the strike, “I don’t think there’s anything valid” in the current talks. But he stopped short of saying Qatar would end its mediation efforts, saying “we will do whatever we can to stop this war.”
A member of Qatar’s Internal Security Force was also killed by the Israeli strike and others were wounded, Qatar’s Interior Ministry said.
Hamas has survived numerous assassinations of top leaders and still shows cohesion in Gaza, despite having suffered major blows in Israel’s campaign, triggered by the militant group’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
As the strike in Qatar threatens to derailceasefire talks, Israel is gearing up fora major offensive aimed at taking over Gaza City. That escalation has been met with heavy international condemnation and opposition within Israel from those who fear it will doom the remaining hostages.
The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday at the request of elected council members Algeria, Pakistan and Somalia.
Surveillance footage aired by Al Jazeera showed the strike happened in Doha’s diplomatic quarter at a series of buildings that housed Hamas’ political wing. An Egyptian official said the strike came when a meeting by Hamas officials over the talks had been scheduled for the site. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to reporters.
Israel has long threatened to strike Hamas leaders wherever they are. While it has often welcomed Qatar’s role as a mediator, alongside Egypt, it has also accused the Gulf nation of not putting enough pressure on the group.
In contrast to previous Israeli operations againstsenior militants abroad, Netanyahu was quick to publicly claim the strike, saying: “Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it and Israel takes full responsibility.”
He said the decision was made Monday aftera shooting attack in Jerusalemthat killed six people and an attack on Israeli forces in Gaza that killed four soldiers.
The Israeli military said it used “precise munitions and additional intelligence” in the strike, without elaborating. It was not immediately clear how it carried out the attack.
Hamas said the attack showed that Netanyahu and his government “do not want to reach any agreement and are deliberately seeking to thwart all opportunities.” It said it also held the United States responsible for the strike.
Egypt, another key mediator with Hamas, also condemned the attack, saying it targeted Palestinian leaders who had met “to discuss ways to reach a ceasefire agreement.” It said the strike was a “direct assault” on Qatar’s sovereignty.
In Israel, the main group representing families of the hostages expressed “deep concern and great fear” after the strike. “The prospect of their return now faces greater uncertainty than ever, with one thing absolutely certain — their time is running out,” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement.
Earlier this week, Trump said he was giving his “last warning” to Hamas regardinga possible ceasefire, as the U.S. advanced a new proposal that Arab officials said included the immediate release of all the hostages.
A senior Hamas official called it a “humiliating surrender document,” but the militant group said it would discuss the proposal and respond within days.
The proposal, presented by Witkoff, calls for a negotiated end of the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza once the hostages are released and a ceasefire is established. That’s according to Egyptian and Hamas officials familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door discussions.
Hamas has said it will only release theremaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying the war will continue until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, with Israel maintaining open-ended security control over Gaza.
Mediators had previously focused on brokering a temporary ceasefire and the release of some hostages, with the two sides then holding talks on a more permanent truce. Witkoff walked away from those talks in July, after whichHamas accepted a proposalthat mediators said was almost identical to an earlier one that Israel had approved.
The war in Gaza has already left Israelincreasingly isolated internationally, with even many of its Western allies calling for it to end the war and do more to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza,parts of which are experiencing famine.
Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the United Arab Emirates’ foreign minister, expressed “full solidarity with our dear Qatar” shortly after the attack.
The United Arab Emiratesrecently warned Israelthat any move to annex the occupied West Bank would threaten the Abraham Accords, a landmark agreement brokered by Trump during his first term in which the two nations normalized relations.
Trump hopes to expand those accords to include regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, but those prospects have dimmed as the war has ground on.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described the strike as a “criminal act and a flagrant violation of international law” in a phone call with Qatar’s ruler.

Piotr Szczerek, a Polish chief executive of a paving firm, said he was ""convinced"" tennis star Kamil Majchrzak had been ""passing his hat in my direction"".
""I know I did something that seemed like consciously collecting a memento from a child,"" he wrote in a statement. ""This wasn't my intention, but it doesn't change the fact that I hurt the boy and disappointed the fans.""
The video, taken during Majchrzak's match on Thursday, showed the tennis player offering his cap to a child, before Mr Szczerek appears to take it.
Versions of the clip were shared widely on social media and prompted criticism of Mr Szczerek's actions.
The 50-year-old wrote on social media on Monday: ""I would like to unequivocally apologise to the injured boy, his family, as well as all the fans and the player himself.""
He added that he had given the hat back to the boy, and hoped that it had ""at least partially repaired the damage that was done"".
Majchrzak, 29, who had just won his match against Russian ninth seed Karen Khachanov when the incident unfolded, told the BBC he believed he ""did what most of athletes would do in this kind of situation"", adding he hoped the boy and his family ""had a great day"".
He earlier indicated to the New York Post that he felt there had been some kind of confusion.
""I was pointing, giving the hat, but I had a lot going on after my match, after being super tired and super excited for the win,"" he said.
""I just missed it... I'm sure the guy was also acting in the moment of heat, in the moment of emotions.""
The tennis star reunited with the boy over the weekend, sharing clips of him giving the young fan a cap and other merchandise on Instagram.
""Today after warm up, I had a nice meeting,"" the tennis star wrote, adding: ""Do you recognise [the cap]?""
Majchrzak, ranked 76th in the world in men's singles, came back from two sets down to beat Khachanov in a second-round match at Flushing Meadows, but was forced to retire injured during the first set of his third-round tie against Switzerland's Leandro Riedi on Saturday.
He later confirmed he had torn an intercostal muscle.
Mr Szczerek and his wife Anna founded his paving company Drogbruk in 1999,polish outlet Tenis Magazyn reported.The company sponsors sporting events and Polish athletes.
The couple and their two sons are amateur tennis players who compete in local leagues, and have hosted Polish tennis pro Urszula Radwańska on their home court, according to Tenis Magazyn.

A new mural by elusive street artist Banksy showing a judge beating an unarmed protester with a gavel will be removed from a wall outside one of London’s most iconic courts, authorities said Monday.
LONDON (AP) — A new mural by elusive street artistBanksyshowing a judge beating an unarmed protester with a gavel will be removed from a wall outside one of London’s most iconic courts, authorities said Monday.
The mural appeared Monday and depicts a protester lying on the ground holding a blood-splattered placard while a judge in a traditional wig and black gown beats him with a gavel. Banksy posted a photo of the work on Instagram, his usual method of claiming a work as authentic. It was captioned “Royal Courts Of Justice. London.”
Security officials outside the courthouse covered the artwork Monday with sheets of black plastic and two metal barriers, and it was being guarded by two officers and a security camera.
Because the Victorian gothic revival style building is 143 years old, the mural will be removed with consideration for its historical significance, according to HM Courts and Tribunals.
“The Royal Courts of Justice is a listed building and HMCTS are obliged to maintain its original character,” it said in a statement. Listed buildings are considered the country’s most significant historic buildings and sites and are protected by law.
While the artwork doesn’t refer to a particular cause or incident, activists saw it as a reference to the U.K. government’sban on the group Palestine Action. On Saturdayalmost 900 people were arrestedat a London protest challenging the ban.

Defend Our Juries, the group that organized the protest, said in a statement that the mural “powerfully depicts the brutality unleashed” by the government ban.
“When the law is used as a tool to crush civil liberties, it does not extinguish dissent, it strengthens it,” the statement said.
The courts have weighed in on the Palestine Action case, with judges initially rejecting the organization’s request to appeal its ban. A High Court court judge then allowed the appeal to go forward, though the government is now challenging that decision.
Banksy began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world’s best-known artists. His paintings and installationssell for millions of dollars at auctionand have drawnthievesandvandals.
Banksy’s work often comments on political issues, with many of his pieces criticizing government policy on migration and war.

At the Glastonbury Festival last year, an inflatable raft holding dummies of migrants in life jackets was unveiled during a band’s headline set. Banksy appeared to claim the stunt, which was thought to symbolize small boat crossings of migrants in the English Channel, in a post on Instagram.
The artist has also taken his message on migration to Europe.
In 2019,“The Migrant Child,”depicting a shipwrecked child holding a pink smoke bomb and wearing a life jacket, was unveiled in Venice, Italy. In 2018, a number of works including one near a former center for migrants that depicted a child spray-painting wallpaper over a swastika were discovered in Paris.
Banksy has also created numerous artworks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the years, including one depicting a girl conducting a body search on an Israeli soldier, another showing a dove wearing a flak jacket, and a masked protester hurling a bouquet of flowers. He designedthe “Walled Off Hotel” guesthousein Bethlehem, which closed in October 2023.
Last summer, Banksy captured London’s attention with ananimal-themed collection,which concluded with a mural of a gorilla appearing to hold up the entrance gate to London Zoo.
For nine days straight, Banksy-created creatures — from a mountain goat perched on a building buttress to piranhas circling a police guard post to a rhinoceros mounting a car — showed up in unlikely locations around the city.

The grandmother of an11-year-old girl who gave birth last month at her family's Oklahoma homewas charged after prosecutors alleged she knew about the pregnancy and failed to report it to authorities.
Michelle Justus, the child’s maternal grandmother, was charged with six counts of felony child neglect, according to the Muskogee County District Attorney’s Office. The charges are in connection with the 11-year-old and five other children who live at the home.
Attorney information for Justus was not listed. She is being held on a $75,000 bond.
Prosecutors said Justus lives across the street from the family and was the children's ""caretaker."" Court documents allege that she failed to provide adequate supervision and medical care for the children and allowed them to live in deplorable conditions.
Prosecutors alleged that Justus was in regular contact with the 11-year-old and saw the girl almost daily, including on Aug. 16, when the girl gave birth. The office said Justus did not report the pregnancy to authorities.
The girl's mother, Cherie Walker, 33, and stepfather, Dustin Walker, 34, were arrested and charged last month. The district attorney's office said DNA test results revealed that the stepfather was a 99.9% match for the baby’s father.
Cherie Walker was charged with enabling child sex abuse and Dustin Walker with sexual abuse of a child under 12. They were both also charged with six counts of felony child neglect.
Their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. They are being held without bond.
Muskogee County Assistant District Attorney Janet Hutson said the case was ""one of the most, if not the most, serious child sexual abuse and neglect cases I have ever prosecuted.""
The other children — ages 9, 7, 6, 4 and 2 — were removed from the home.
Court documents said that dog feces were found littered in the home and the children had no clothes on.

A federal appeals court on Monday rejected President Donald Trump's appeal of writer E. Jean Carroll's defamation verdict against the president, leaving him on the hook forthe $83 million judgment.
""[W]e conclude that Trump has failed to identify any grounds that would warrant reconsidering our prior holding on presidential immunity. We also conclude that the district court did not err in any of the challenged rulings and that the jury’s damages awards are fair and reasonable,"" the ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said.
""The record in this case supports the district court’s determination that the ‘the degree of reprehensibility’ of Mr. Trump’s conduct was remarkably high, perhaps unprecedented,” the three-judge panel found, referring to the punitive damages award against the president.
Trump's attorneys had argued the verdict needed to be tossed because it ""severely damages the presidency and is a great miscarriage of justice.""
Carroll's lawyer had told the appeals court it should stand because ""the president is not above the law.""
A representative of Trump's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan said in a statement, ""We look forward to an end to the appellate process so that justice will finally be done.”
A New York jury returned the verdict in January of last year, awarding Carroll $83.3 million in damages for Trump repeatedly defaming her during his first term in office and in the years that followed — including during the defamation trial.
The amount Trump has to pay has increased in the months since then, thanks to New York’s 9% annual interest rate on such awards.
Trump first alleged Carroll was a liar in 2019 after she went public with a claim that Trump had sexually assaulted her in the dressing room of a Manhattan department store in the mid-1990s. Trump denied the allegations and called the claims a ""hoax"" and a ""con job,"" and said that Carroll had made up the story to increase sales of a book she had coming out.
Carroll filed two lawsuits against Trump. The first was for defaming her while he was president — the case that led to the $83 million verdict.
While that case was tied up on an earlier appeal, Carroll filed a second case for defamatory comments Trump made after he left the White House, and also for the alleged assault itself, an action that was made possible after New York passeda lawthat opened a one-year window for adult victims of sexual offenses to file civil suits even if the statute of limitations on their claims had expired — as it had for Carroll.
The jury in that case found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her and awarded her$5 million in damagesin May 2023.
Those findings wound up focusing the second trial solely on damages, which Trump's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged in their appeal. They also contended the verdict should be tossed because Trump was protected by presidential immunity when he first made the comments. His initial denial was put out through the White House press office, which also disseminated comments he made to reporters the next day, they noted.
""The two statements on matters of public concern issued through official White House channels fall squarely within the outer perimeter of President Trump’s official responsibilities,"" his attorneys argued.
Carroll's lawyers contended the comments involved Trump's ""personal conduct.""
Trump ""was not speaking here about a governmental policy or a function of his responsibilities as President,"" they argued in a filing. ""He was defaming Carroll because of her revelation that many years before he assumed office, he sexually assaulted her. The defamation at issue concerned quintessentially 'personal' conduct.""
They also contended he'd waited too long to raise the immunity defense. Trump attorney Justin Smith told the appeals court judges at a hearing in June that last year's Supreme Court ruling broadening the scope of presidential immunity shows that the immunity defense is ""not waivable.""
Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, countered that the word ""waiver"" doesn't even appear in that Supreme Court ruling.
Kaplan also urged the judges not to reduce the jury's award, which included $11 million for damage to Carroll’s reputation, $7.3 million for emotional harm and other damages, and $65 million in punitive damages.
The punitive award ""was not only just, but clearly aimed at the goal of deterring further defamation,"" Kaplan argued.
""Throughout the trial, the jury had a front-row seat to Trump’s relentless campaign of malice, including his repeated defamation of Carroll at press conferences he held and in statements he posted on social media while the trial was ongoing,"" she said, adding that the verdict shows ""that even the richest and most powerful can be held responsible under our legal system.""
The appeals court agreed, rejecting the immunity arguments and finding the high punitive damages award was warranted.
""Given the unique and egregious facts of this case, we conclude that the punitive damages award did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness,"" the panel found, saying Trump's conduct ""involved malice and deceit, caused severe emotional injury, and continued over at least a five-year period.""
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsalso affirmed last yearthe $5 million verdict in Carroll's first suit.Trump is appealingthat ruling to the Supreme Court.
The president has repeatedly denied Carroll’s allegations and any wrongdoing in the case.

James Dobson, who founded the conservative Christian ministry Focus on the Family and was a politically influential campaigner against abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, died on Thursday. He was 89.
Born in 1936 in Shreveport, Louisiana, Dobson was a child psychologist who launched a radio show to counsel Christians on parenting and started Focus on the Family in 1977. Alongside fundamentalist giants like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, he became a force in the 1980s for pushing conservative Christian ideals in mainstream American politics.
At its peak, Focus on the Family had more than 1,000 employees and gave Dobson a platform to weigh in on legislation and serve as an adviser to five presidents. His broad reach includes authoring more than 70 books, being translated into 27 languages, and airing on 4,000 radio stations, according to the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute.

His death was confirmed by his institute. He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Shirley, as well as their two children, a daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.

Dobson interviewed President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office in 1985, and Falwell called him a rising star in 1989. Decades later, he was among the evangelical leaders tapped to advise PresidentDonald Trump. in 2016.
In 2022, he praised Trump for appointing conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices who allowed states toban abortion.
“Whether you like Donald Trump or not, whether you supported or voted for him or not, if you are supportive of this Dobbs decision that struck down Roe v. Wade, you have to mention in the same breath the man who made it possible,” he said in abroadcast.
Dobson belongs on the “Mount Rushmore” of Christian conservatives, said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, another group Dobson founded. He promoted ideas from “a biblical standpoint” that pushed back against progressive parenting of the 1960s, Perkins said.

In his 1970 parenting book “Dare to Discipline,” updated in 1992, Dobson said parents should spank kids to discipline them and enforce boundaries. Children should not be struck in anger, but “the spanking should be of sufficient magnitude to cause genuine tears.”
“I know that some of my readers could argue,” he wrote, “that the deliberate premeditated application of minor pain to a small child is a harsh and unloving thing to do. To others, it will seem like pure barbarism. I obviously disagree.”
John Fea, an American History professor at Messiah College in Pennsylvania, is critical of Dobson’s ideas. However, he recounted how his father — a tough Marine — was a better parent after becoming an evangelical Christian and listening to Dobson’s radio program.
“Even as a self-identified evangelical Christian that I am, I have no use in my own life for Dobson’s politics or his child-rearing,” he said. “But as a historian what do you do with these stories? About a dad who becomes a better dad?”
After developing a following of millions, Dobson considered running for president in 2000, following in the footsteps of former television minister Pat Robertson’s surprise success in 1988.
“He was not afraid to speak out,” said Ralph Reed, a Christian conservative political organizer and lobbyist who founded the Faith and Freedom Coalition. “If Jim had decided to run, he would have been a major force.”
Still, Reed’s enduring memory is traveling through rural America as a younger political organizer, with Dobson’s voice as his sole companion.
“I’d be out there somewhere, and I could go to the AM dial and there was never a time, day or night when I couldn’t find that guy,” Reed said. “There will probably never be another one like him.”
Focus on the Family moved from California to Colorado Springs, Colorado, in the 1990s, establishing the city as a hub for evangelicals sometimes nicknamed the “Vatican of the West.”
James Bopp, a lawyer who has represented Focus on the Family, said Dobson could rally public support like few other social conservatives.
Dobson helped create a constellation of allied Family Policy Councils in around 40 states that push a socially conservative agenda and lobby lawmakers, said Peter Wolfgang, executive director of one such group in Connecticut.
“If there is one man above all whom I would credit with being the builder — not just the thinker — who gave us the institutions that created the space for President Trump to help us turn the tide in the culture war, it would be Dr. James Dobson,” Wolfgang wrote in an online column last month.
Records compiled by the watchdog group Open Secrets show Focus on the Family and Family Research Council together spent more than $4 million on political ads and nearly $2 million lobbying Congress since the late 1990s.
Dobson left Focus on the Family in 2010 and founded the institute that bears his name. He continued with his nationally syndicated radio show Family Talk, carried by 1,500 radio outlets with more than half a million listeners weekly, according to the institute.
Guests on his show have discussed the importance of embracing religion and promoting the idea that people could change their sexuality.
“The homosexual community will tell us that transformations never occur. That you cannot change,” he said in a 2021 video posted on his institute’s site that touted “success stories” of people who “no longer struggle with homosexuality” after attending a ministry. He said there is typically “pain and agitation” associated with homosexuality.
Conversion therapyis the scientifically discredited practice of using therapy to “convert” LGBTQ+ people to heterosexuality or traditional gender expectations.
The practice is banned in 23 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank.
The U.S. Supreme Courtagreed in March to hear a Colorado case about whether state and local governments can enforce laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.

Texas cannot require public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom, a judge said Wednesday in a temporary ruling against the state's new requirement, making it the third such state law to be blocked by a court.
A group of Dallas-area families and faith leaders sought a preliminary injunction against the law, which goes into effect on Sept. 1. They say the requirement violates the First Amendment's protections for the separation of church and state and the right to free religious exercise.
Texas is the largest state to attempt such a requirement, and U.S. District Judge Fred Biery's ruling from San Antonio is the latest in a widening legal fight that's expected to eventually go before the U.S. Supreme Court.
""Even though the Ten Commandments would not be affirmatively taught, the captive audience of students likely would have questions, which teachers would feel compelled to answer. That is what they do,"" Biery wrote in the 55-page ruling that began with quoting the First Amendment and ended with ""Amen.""
The lawsuit names the Texas Education Agency, state education Commissioner Mike Morath and three Dallas-area school districts as defendants.
A federal appeals court has blocked a similar law in Louisiana, and a judge in Arkansas told four districts they cannot put up the posters, although other districts in the state said they're not putting them up either.
Although Friday's ruling marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the law violates the separation of church and state, the legal battle is likely far from over.
Religious groups and conservatives say the Ten Commandments are part of the foundation of the United States' judicial and educational systems and should be displayed. Texas has a Ten Commandments monument on the Capitol grounds and won a 2005 Supreme Court case that upheld the monument.
In Louisiana — the first state that mandated the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms — a panel of three appellate judges in June ruled that the law was unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court is clearing the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles, another victory for President Donald Trump at the high court. California Attorney General Rob Bonta calls the ruling “disturbing.”

WASHINGTON (AP) —The Supreme Courton Monday cleared the way for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles,the latest victoryfor President Donald Trump’s administration at the high court.
The conservative majority lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around LA. The order had barredimmigration agentsfrom stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.
The court’s 6-3 decision followed a pattern of at least temporarily allowing some of the Republican administration’s harshest policies, while leaving room for the possibility of a different outcome after the legal case plays out fully. The net effect, meanwhile, has Trump pushing ahead in many of the areas he considers most critical.
The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court’s emergency docket. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can carry out brief stops for questioning. “The prospect of such after-the-fact judicial second-guessing and contempt proceedings will inevitably chill lawful immigration enforcement efforts,” he wrote in a concurrence.
In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision erodes constitutional freedoms.
“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” she wrote. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”
Kavanaugh, for his part, suggested stops in which agents use force could yet face legal challenges.
The Supreme Court’s decision comes as ICE agents also step up enforcement in Washington as part ofTrump’s unprecedented federal takeoverof the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the National Guard.
The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California, with a hearing set for Sept. 24. It was filed by immigrant advocacy groups that accused the Trump administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during his administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.
U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles had founda “mountain of evidence”that enforcement tactics were violating the Constitution. The plaintiffs included U.S. citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.
Federal attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the U.S., not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the Justice Department argued thatICE agentscan use at least some of those factors in combination with others, and Kavanaugh said apparent ethnicity could be a relevant factor for a stop.
The Department of Homeland Security said last week that authorities had made 5,210 immigration arrests since June 6 and praised the work of its lead commander there, Gregory Bovino, whose “success in getting the worst of the worst out of the Los Angeles region speaks for itself.”
The agency promised in an online post to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles” after the high court’s decision.
The region has been top priority for the Trump administration, and its hard-line immigration strategy has spurred protests andthe deployment of the National Guardand the Marines.
The number of raids in the LA area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agentsjumped out of the back of a rented box truckand made arrests at an LA Home Depot store as the administration carries outthe president’s goal of mass deportations.
Attorney General Pam Bondi and border czar Tom Homan both separately applauded the ruling. “Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” Bondi wrote in a social media post.
The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors like apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It had covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.
The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops that do not align with the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent.
Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said the Supreme Court decision will fuel aggressive immigration enforcement in other major cities. “The Supreme Court majority makes clear that average non-white workers are targets, and it functionally gives its stamp of approval for Trump to trample their bedrock constitutional rights,” he said.
Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two U.S. citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles residentBrian Gavidia, who was shown in a June 13 video being seized by federal agents and pressed against a metal fence with his arm twisted behind his back as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”
A terrified Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.
Democratic leaders in California condemned the decision. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she has directed city departments to follow rules barring the use of municipal resources on federal immigration enforcement. “This isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles. This is an attack on every person in this city, and in every city in this country,” Bass told reporters.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta pointed out the Supreme Court recently ruled that race can’t be considered in college admissions. “They prevent the use of race (in college admissions) to tackle discrimination but allow the use of race to potentially discriminate,” he said.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, a vocal Trump opponent, said the order would allow agents wide latitude to make stops “including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses.”
Plaintiff Pedro Vasquez Perdomo said ICE agents never explained why they stopped him or showed a warrant.
“I was treated like I didn’t matter — locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay?” he said in a statement. “That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

reddit,r/news/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn825x71g4do,t3_1nc1sal,Murdochs reach deal in succession battle over media empire,Gloomy_Course7396,2025-09-08 22:22:33,2229,171,N/A,N/A,N/A,"A years-long succession battle withinRupert Murdoch's conservative media empire has drawn to a close, with his son Lachlan set to control the news group.
The deal, which the family announced on Monday, will ensure the ongoing conservative leaning of Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post after 94-year-old Rupert's death.
Under the agreement Lachlan will control a new trust while siblings Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will cease being beneficiaries of any trust with shares in Fox or News Corp.
It follows years of tension between the media mogul and three of his children over the future of the family-owned newspapers and television networks.
The Murdoch family's internal turmoil served as inspiration for the hit television drama Succession. The deal announced on Monday - the finale of the real-life saga - ends all litigation over the family's trust.
Lachlan's more politically moderate oldest siblings are poised to sell their holdings in Fox and News Corp in the coming months.
They will also be named as beneficiaries of a new trust, which will receive cash from the sale of about 14.2 million shares of News Corp and 16.9 million shares of Fox Corp.
According to reports, Prudence, Elisabeth and James will receive around $1.1bn (£810m) each.
The sale of their shares will add to the three siblings' existing inheritance, but prevent them from having any influence over the political bent of the family's media conglomerate.
Andrew Neil, the former editor of the Sunday Times and the founding chair of Sky TV, said the outcome was a success for Rupert Murdoch, though ""an expensive success"".
Describing Lachlan as a ""chip off the old block"", Neil said Rupert's fear was that ""when he went to the great newsroom in the sky Lachlan would be outvoted"" by his three oldest siblings ""who are of a small 'l' liberal bent"".
""That won't happen now because they've been bought out… Lachlan Murdoch is now king of the hill in a new trust that will have control of the organisation and he runs that without fear of interference from his siblings,"" he told the BBC.
James has in recent years distanced himself from his family's business, citing disagreements over editorial content.
Lachlan is currently the chair of News Corp, which counts The Wall Street Journal and The Times among its publications. He is widely seen as the most politically conservative of Rupert's oldest children.
Matthew Ricketson, professor of communication at Deakin University in Melbourne, said the bitter legal battle had been over family control of a vast empire that Rupert has always described as a ""family business"".
""He seems to have torn apart his family in the process,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
""It is now resolved but you can't see them all being very happy about it and the bitter irony is Rupert Murdoch has always said that he has built this business, it is a family business, he wants his family to take it over when he eventually passes on.""
News Corp said: ""The leadership, vision and management by the company's chair, Lachlan Murdoch, will continue to be important to guiding the company's strategy and success.""
Of Rupert's six children, the oldest four have been implicated in the legal turmoil over the company's future. His younger children from his marriage to Wendi Deng Murdoch, Chloe and Grace, are also named as beneficiaries in the new family trust.
Lachlan has been running the media empire since Rupert stepped back in September 2023 though Murdoch senior has remained as chairman emeritus of both Fox Corporation and News Corp.
Prof Ricketson said that James, Elisabeth and Prudence, in particular James, have ""been opposed to the way in which News Corporation and Fox Corporation have been going about their work"".
He said that James has disagreed with reporting on climate change and on the 2020 US election ""which Donald Trump said he hadn't lost but everybody else said and knew that he had lost it"".
""Fox News gave him an enormous platform,"" to promote that theory, Prof Ricketson said. ""That was something that James disagreed with.""
The battle over control of the media empire played out largely behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers unusual privacy for family trust disputes, after Rupert took the surprising step of attempting to alter the terms of the family's trust.
He wanted to ensure his empire would fall solely into Lachlan's hands rather than to all four of the oldest children, but in December last year a Reno court rejected that bid saying Rupert and Lachlan had acted in ""bad faith"" in trying to amend the trust.
Monday's deal was a ""mutual resolution of the legal proceedings"", according to the companies.
They were originally expected to leave the US at about 14:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Wednesday.
The US President wants to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine.
The judge's ruling is a win for the US Federal Reserve following criticism by the president.
The latest batch of Epstein files released by Congress give an insight into the convicted sex offender's sprawling and elite social circle.
The US president says he feels ""very badly"" about the location of the attack and calls Qatar a ""close ally"".

The complaint alleges that Romeo, alongside his 25-year-old mother, aHondurannational, and his sister, was arrested during what they believed was a routine check‑in with ICE. Instead of routine processing, Romeo's mother, Rosario, was denied access to counsel, barred from making any custody arrangements, and prevented from preparing for her children's care.
According to the filing, revealed byThe Miami Herald,ICE agents forced the family through the back door, sequestering them incommunicado. Without warning, late on April 24 or early April 25, they were transported first to a hotel in Alexandria, Louisiana, then to an airport before being placed on a flight to Honduras approximately four hours later.
Romeo's treatment had been ongoing at Manning Family Children's Hospital inNew Orleanssince his diagnosis in 2023, when he was two years old. Romeo, whose health has worsened since the cancer spread to his lungs, has been flying ""back and forth"" between Honduras andthe U.S.for his medical appointments. However, the complaint alleges that paying for these flights has put a strain on Rosario's ""very limited financial resources.""
The families' attorneyswrotethat ""As a direct consequence of ICE's unlawful conduct, Romeo was deprived of much-needed continuity in his treatment, and he has faced substantial health risks due to his inability to access emergency specialized care and the routine critical oncological care that was available to him in the United States.""
The lawsuit charges that ICE violated its own policies and federal law by denying the parents the right to arrange for their U.S. citizen children's care before deportation, effectively removing the children's constitutional rights to due process. The plaintiffs seek a jury trial, injunctions compelling their return to the U.S., and accountability from ICE officials, including field office directors, acting agency heads, and the Secretary of Homeland Security and Attorney General.
This child is a citizen. This child is sick. This child was deported without legal consultation even though their attorney WAS IN THE SAME BUILDING. When will enough be enough? When will people who support this regime open their eyes and realize that this isn’t about politics?#wethepeoplearepissed#fyp#kristinoem#massdeportation#immigration#dueprocessforall
The deportation of Romeo and two other U.S.-citizen children, ages 2, 4 (Romeo), and 7, occurred before federal courts opened, preventing legal challenges or habeas corpus filings. Legal advocates and civil‑rights groups, including the ACLU, condemned the move as an egregious constitutional violation, especially given the medical vulnerability of the affected children.
ICE andDepartment of Homeland Securityspokespeople have countered that the mothers requested their children accompany them, a claim widely disputed by attorneys for the families due to the absence of consent or due process rights. U.S. District Judge Terry A. Doughtynoted""strong suspicion that the government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.""

Four hikers who had consumed psychedelic mushrooms – including one experiencing a “debilitating high” – had to be rescued fromNew York’s Catskill Mountains after they got lost there, according to state authorities.
In anews release, forest rangers from the the New York state department of environmental conservation (DEC) said that they were alerted to the situation at about 5pm on 29 August after the receipt of a satellite text.
The message came from a hiker who reported that a group of four hikers were lost near Giant Ledge in the Slide Mountain Wilderness – aninterconnected trail hikewith elevations ranging from 1,100 to 2,600ft and several sheer cliffs and drops.
“The original caller admitted the group had consumed mushrooms and one of them was experiencing a debilitating high,” the DEC said.
Three forest rangers responded and located the group at approximately 6.45pm. They helped the group to the trailhead, where the hikers were evaluated by a Shandaken ambulance crew.
Complicating matters for the group of hikers was the fact that they had also lost their car keys, the news release said.
“Rangers provided a courtesy ride to the subjects’ rental lodging,” authorities said. They added that ranger Russell Martin “hiked back up” the following day and “found a sling bag with the keys under a log in tall ferns”.
Martin, who participated in the rescue, told theNew York Times: “I’m not an expert in mushrooms, but these gentlemen definitely rode highs and lows.”
The DEC did not release the names of the hikers, but Martin said that all four were men in their 20s.
The Police Benevolent Association of New York State, a law enforcement union, commended the rangers’ efforts in astatement.
“This level of dedication, at the start of a busy Labor Day weekend, is representative of the commitment shared by our forest ranger members,” the union said. “The PBA ofNew YorkState is proud to highlight our forest rangers and all members’ continued dedication to public safety in the face of difficulty and danger.”
The rescue in the Catskills called to mind a similar case from May, in which two hikers who had reportedly ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms called authorities to report that a third member of their group had died.
But, when the rangers arrived, they found the third individual alive and uninjured. It was determined that the two hikers were in an “altered mental state”, anews releasesaid.
The two hikers who had “ingested hallucinogenic mushrooms” were escorted to a waiting ambulance as well as a New York state police cruiser, and the third was taken back to the group’s campsite."

""The supreme leader of the world's largest superpower is objectively a Soviet or Russian asset,"" said de Sousa on August 27 during a speech in Castelo de Vide.
Trump's efforts to present himself as the main mediator in reconciling Ukraine and Russia did not make a good impression on the Portuguese president. De Sousa noted that Trump's attempts to ""settle"" the war were not beneficial for Ukraine.
""Objectively, the new US leadership strategically contributed to Russia,"" he added.
As an example, de Sousa reminded that ""every day"" there are new threats from the US to impose sanctions on the Kremlin. However, in reality, none of Trump's promises to strengthen sanctions had been fulfilled.
According to the Portuguese leader, Trump tries to play the role of an ""arbiter,"" but at the same time wants to negotiate ""only with one side."" Kyiv and its European allies are literally forced to pressure Washington to also take part in the negotiations.
De Sousa added that Europe downplayed ""the importance of Trump and Trumpism"" and also did not believe that the balance of power in the White House and US policy could change so drastically after Trump came to power.
Meanwhile, media write that US President Donald Trump is not satisfied with the demands of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Europe for ending the war. He wants peace at any cost.

Norway's left-wing bloc, led by incumbent Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, has won Monday's national election by a narrow five-seat margin with almost all the votes counted.
With 99 percent of votes counted in the 2025 Norwegian election the group of left-leaning parties have won by 87 seats to 82, allowing Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre to remain in power.
Earlier in the evening the first projected results gave the five ""red-green"" parties -- Støre's Labour, the Centre Party, the Greens, the Socialist Left and the Red party -- 87 seats compared to 82 seats to the opposing right-leaning parties. This was then updated to 88 and 81 respectively but later changed back to the original projection.

Conservative leader Erna Solberg and Progress Party leader Sylvi Listhaug have both called Støre to concede the election, sources told broadcasterTV2.
""I have a good feeling. We've had a good election campaign,"" Støre told his supporters just before the first results came out.
ON THIS TOPIC:What happens next in Norway after left-wing bloc wins election
In power since 2021, Støre is poised to continue as head of a minority government, which is common in Scandinavia.
His Labour Party was seen coming out on top with around 28 percent of voter support.
If the figures are confirmed, Labour will need need the backing of the other four left-wing parties, which are divided on a myriad of issues, to obtain a majority to pass legislation and its budget.
The three smaller parties in the red-green group, the Greens, the Socialist Left and the Red party, are all set to gain the crucial 4 percent share of the vote, which is the threshold needed to enter parliament. This is a key element in providing the left 'bloc' with an overall win.

On the right, the populist Progress Party led by Listhaug has gained 24 percent of the vote - a huge jump of 12 percent compared to its 2021 vote share, while the Conservatives, led by former PM Solberg, were forecast to fall back by 6 percent to just 14 percent of the overall vote.
Boosted by younger voters, in particular men, the Progress Party became the leading opposition force overtaking Solberg's Conservative Party.
""Do we want to continue as before, spending more and maintaining very high taxes without getting more for our money than neighbouring countries, or do we want to take back control and stop the waste,"" Progress Party leader Sylvi Listhaug told broadcaster TV2 on Monday.
The centrist Liberal (Venstre) party, which backs Solberg for Prime Minister, has taken a 3.6 percent vote share, meaning it would not qualify for representation in parliament.
Labour's vote share of 28 percent, 1.9 points more than in 2021, represented a solid return for the governing party.
The Centre Party has dropped 7.8 percentage points compared to its 2021 result, which was a historically strong performance for the agrarian, EU-skeptic party.
READ ALSO:
The result was projected by the Norwegian Directorate of Elections at 9pm on Monday evening, just as polling stations closed across the country.
The election campaign in the wealthy nation of 5.6 million people centred largely on domestic issues like purchasing power, inequality, public services and taxes.
Several dozen wealthy Norwegians have fled to Switzerland in recent years to avoid wealth tax, and the two blocs have butted heads over whether to maintain or abolish the tax.
""What really has been a concern for people is their daily situation in their personal economy, how to cope with increasing prices,"" Støre told reporters after casting his ballot with his wife at an Oslo school earlier in the day.
Norwegians cast their ballots at polling stations throughout the day, with a record number 1.9 million people having alsovoted in advancebetween August 11th and September 5th.

reddit,r/worldnews/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jz08j8313o,t3_1ncjrpx,"Twenty-three killed in Russian strike on pension queue, Ukraine says",cealild,2025-09-09 14:02:15,7,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Twenty-four people have been killed and 19 injured in a Russian air strike on a village in eastern Ukraine, local officials say.
The victims were ""ordinary civilians"" collecting their pensions in Yarova, Donetsk region, said President Volodymyr Zelensky. Regional head Vadym Filashkin said emergency services were working at the scene, urging residents to ""evacuate to safer regions"".
Yarova is to the north of Slovyansk, one of the big cities in the region, and only a few kilometres from the front line as Russian forces advance slowly in the east.
If confirmed, the death toll would be among the heaviest attacks on Ukrainian civilians in recent weeks, 42 months into Russia's full-scale invasion.
Twenty-three people were killed in overnight air strikes on Ukraine's capital Kyiv at the end of August.
At the weekend Russia launched its biggest air assault of the war on Kyiv so far, hitting the main government building in the capital, in what Zelensky said was a ""ruthless"" attack aimed at prolonging the war.
Posting graphic footage of the attack on Yarova online, Zelensky said there were ""no words"" to describe the latest Russian strikes. There was no immediate response from Russia's military.
The head of the local administration in the nearby city of Lyman, Oleksandr Zhuravlyov, told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne that the attack took place at about 10:40 local time (07:40 GMT) on Tuesday, as pensions were being handed out.
He said most of the victims were elderly people.
Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later said Russia ""dropped a guided air bomb"" on the village.
Pictures from the scene showed a badly damaged Ukrainian postal service vehicle of the type used to distribute pensions.
The head of the Ukrposhta service said the vehicle had been parked under trees as a security measure and a local postal official had been wounded in the attack. ""Maybe someone gave away the co-ordinates,"" he speculated.
Yarova sits on a key railway line between the cities of Lyman and Izium. It is also only about 6km (3.7 miles) away from the next village of Novoselivka, where Russian forces are closing in on the outskirts.
Zhuravlyov told Suspilne they had to work out how the postal service could continue to hand out pensions: ""Because the front line is less than 10km away, we will 'move away' all these payments, so they can have their pensions in safer places.""
Local officials said 22 people had already been evacuated from the area.
Ukraine's state emergency service DSNS said another three people had been killed in earlier Russian shelling of settlements in Donetsk.
""The world must not remain silent,"" Zelensky said, calling for a response from both the US, Europe and the G20 group of nations.
The US President wants to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine.
Nato jets were also deployed to respond to drones that entered Polish airspace during Russian strikes on Ukraine.
The talks between India and EU come as Trump urges EU to impose 100% tariffs on India and China for buying Russian oil.
A new law says men under the age of 23 can now leave the country. But why has Ukraine brought it in?
The murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a train prompted an outcry over public safety and a debate over crime policy.

If he goes further, he will have to ""lay down"" millions of Russian soldiers, states Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during apress conferencewith Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.
Zelenskyy emphasized that no one trusts Putin.
""For some, it’s just territory, but for us, it’s our life, our history, our Constitution. These are homes, these are families, these are many, many aspects that are very sensitive for Ukraine. Those who lived there and those who have now left their homes because of bombings and occupation would want to return. Yes, perhaps it’s unrealistic right now, but they will return,"" he said.
According to him, there is no single or reasonable approach in the form of exchanging territories.
""If you don’t trust this person, if this person has already partially occupied you, if you understand all the aspects of a full-scale war—meaning that even if you step back, if someone supports that crazy idea, who can then give you guarantees that Putin won’t continue? No one can give guarantees,"" the president noted.
He stressed that Putin has lied many times, so he cannot be trusted, and Ukraine will not give him its territories.
""This is a very powerful part of our defensive line. He has already lost many servicemen there — over 100,000, especially in key directions. I mean Putin. So it’s clear that over 4 years, he has not managed to occupy more than 30% of a single region in Donbas,"" Zelenskyy added.
He pointed out that if the Russian leader goes further, it would take him years.
""I don’t know how many years, but it will be years. You understand, the issue here is not just years, not just time. The question is that he would have to lay down millions of soldiers. That’s exactly why we will not give him such gifts,"" the president emphasized.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump suggested a ""territory swap"" as a way to resolve Russia’s war against Ukraine.
He also promised that efforts would be made to return some of the territories currently under Russian occupation to Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in turn, emphasized that Ukraine will not agree to a territory exchange with Russia, as this is prohibited by the Constitution.
Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada (the parliament) of Ukraine, Ruslan Stefanchuk, alsostatedthat Ukraine cannot engage in a territory exchange with Russia, even through holding a referendum. Violating territorial integrity is against the law.
Earlier, Head of the President’s Office Andriy Yermak stressed that Ukrainehas no plans to hold a referendumto recognize the territories occupied by Russia.
According to him, Ukraine realistically acknowledges that Russia has seized part of its territory. However, there will be no referendums to recognize this occupation."

Russia would kill innocent people in Czechia just like it does in Ukraine, the Czech intelligence service’s chief Michal Koudelka said Monday.
Speaking at a conferenceon internal security and state resilience in the Czech Chamber of Deputies, he accused Russia of committing “brutal murders” and of “deliberately targeting civilians — women, children, and innocent, defenseless Ukrainian citizens.”
“We should all be absolutely certain that the Russians would do the same to us,” said Koudelka. “Let there be no doubt about it.”
The warning comes as Czechia prepares for an election in October. Russian influence on elections in Central and Eastern Europe, such as those ofRomaniaand ofMoldova later this month, has been a key concern for Brussels over the last year as it works to maintain support for Ukraine.
The Czech Security Information Service, BIS, has been regularly warning about Russian influence operations in Czechia, noting attempts to push media narratives favorable to the Kremlin or hacking government institutions.
Russia seeks to sow division and erode public trust in institutions, the state, the rule of law, and Czechia’s place in the international community, said Koudelka.
In its2024 report, the spy service said that Russia had been hiring migrants from outside the EU to commit crimes, spread fear and undermine trust in the government.
Investigative outletVoxpot foundthat the output of Czech disinformation websites — with articles translated from Russian outlets under sanctions — is at its highest level in history ahead of the October election.
Koudelka also said that Russia doesn’t want to end its war against Ukraine, or it would have already done so. He added that Ukrainians are fighting for the freedom of Czechia.
“They are giving us time to prepare for possible Russian aggression,” he said, adding that the only language Russia speaks is strength, and Czechia must show determination to defend freedom.”
Tunisian authorities deny an attack took place.
Kremlin leader delivers another warning as Kyiv’s Western allies weigh security guarantees that would follow a peace deal or ceasefire.
European Commission executive vice president on Thursday issued Brussels’ strongest condemnation so far of Israel’s assault on Gaza.

""That is, he (Putin) says that in three to four months, and this is what he told the Americans, the White House, and President Trump's representative Witkoff, he said that he would take Donbas in two to three months, maximum four months,"" Zelenskysaid.
Donbas is the eastern region comprisingDonetskandLuhanskoblasts. Russia invaded Donbas in 2014 before launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
The Ukrainian leader warned that Moscow's plans could cost ""years and a million people,"" or even ""two or three million corpses"" ifRussiaaccelerates its offensive.
The remarks come as earlierreporting indicatedPutin demanded that Ukraine cede Donbas as a precondition for peace. In return, Moscow would freeze the war along the current front lines.
A source in the Ukrainian Presidential Officeearlier toldthe Kyiv Independent that Moscow's proposal would require Kyiv to withdraw from the Ukrainian-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts in exchange for Russia pulling back from parts of Sumy and Kharkiv oblasts.
The Kremlin has not publicly confirmed such a plan.
Russia'smaximalist demandsinclude full control of four Ukrainian regions it only partially occupies — the Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts. Putin has also pushed for a ban on Ukraine's NATO membership.
According toReuters' sources, Putin believes his army is ""winning"" on the battlefield, despite Russia takingless than 1%of additional Ukrainian territory since November 2022.
Zelenskysaidon Aug. 20 that it would take Russia another four years to fully seize Donbas.
Since returning to office in January, U.S. PresidentDonald Trumphas pledged to broker a swift peace deal, but talks have stalled as Moscow continues to reject a ceasefire and push for territorial concessions.
Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, followed by parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2022 after holding sham referenda.

Women have often been the last to be rescued, or not rescued at all, due to ‘no skin contact with unrelated males’ rule that forbids male rescues from touching them.
Strict cultural and religious norms, enforced by the Taliban government in Afghanistan, permit only a woman’s close male relative, her father, brother, husband or son, to touch her and similarly, women are prohibited from touching men outside their family.
This rule makes the situation even more dire in the absence of female rescue workers, a consequence of the Taliban’s ban on women’s enrollment in medical education and other public roles. As a result, women trapped under debris are sometimes left behind while the dead are pulled out, further underscoring how gender rules, not just rubble, are obstructing rescue efforts in a country ruled by the Taliban for the past four years.
“They gathered us in one corner and forgot about us,” a New York Time report quoted Bibi Aysha as she recalled how rescue teams arrived more than 36 hours after a massive earthquake devastated her village in Afghanistan’s mountainous Kunar Province.
But instead of being helped, Aysha and other injured women and girls, out of which some were bleeding, were ignored. No one offered the women help, asked what they needed or even approached them.
Tahzeebullah Muhazeb, a 33-year-old male volunteer who reached the nearby village of Mazar Dara, also described the grim on-ground reality to the global publication and said: women trapped under rubble were left waiting while male rescue workers hesitated to touch them, fearing the cultural consequences of interacting with unrelated women.
In some cases, female victims remained buried until women from neighbouring areas arrived to help. “It felt like women were invisible,” said Muhazeb, adding that men and children were treated first, while the women were just sitting apart, waiting for care. If no male relative was present, he added, the dead were dragged out by their clothes to avoid physical contact.
More than 2,200 people were killed and 3,600 injured in the magnitude 6 earthquake that flattened entire villages. The horrific natural calamity also exposed the deeply entrenched gender discrimination women face in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
“Women and girls will again bear the brunt of this disaster,” warned Susan Ferguson, the UN Women representative in Afghanistan. “Their needs must be at the heart of the response and recovery.”
While the Taliban have not released a gender-specific casualty count, survivors, doctors and aid workers consistently report that women are suffering disproportionately. Many remain trapped, untreated or unaccounted for, hindered by rules that restrict male rescuers from physically assisting them.
A critical shortage of female healthcare workers has only made this worse in the quake-hit regions. Following the Taliban’s 2023 ban on women enroling in medical education, female doctors and nurses are rare, especially in rural, disaster-hit areas. The New York Times report also mentioned how one of the hospitals visited by their journalist had no female staff at all.
Sharafat Zaman, a spokesperson for the Taliban-run Ministry of Health, acknowledged the lack of female workers but insisted women were serving in hospitals across Kunar, Nangarhar and Laghman provinces to treat earthquake victims.
Afghanistan remains one of the most repressive places in the world for women and girls under Taliban rule, which has persisted for the past four years. Despite mounting pressure from the broader Muslim world, human rights groups and international institutions like the World Bank, the Taliban have shown no signs of easing their strict gender policies, which experts warn are severely damaging the country’s social cohesion and economic future.
Girls are barred from attending schools beyond sixth grade and women face tight restrictions on movement, requiring a male guardian to travel even short distances. Employment opportunities are also vanishing; women are banned from working in most sectors, including humanitarian organisations and NGOs.
The report also mentions that even Afghan women employed by UN agencies have not been spared, many have faced escalating harassment, with threats so grave that some agencies were forced to tell female staff to work from home for their own safety.- EndsPublished By:Shipra ParasharPublished On:Sep 5, 2025Tune InMust Watch"

Florida surgeon general equates vaccine mandates to ‘slavery’ while announcing new policy push
I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read ourPrivacy notice
Under the leadership of GovernorRon DeSantis,Floridawill become the first state to end allvaccinemandates, it was announced Wednesday.
Equatingvaccinemandates with “slavery,” Joseph Ladapo, the state’s surgeon general who has a history of promoting health-related misinformation, said theFloridaDepartment of Health and the governor’s office would work together toend every single vaccine mandate.
“Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” Ladapo said.
For decades, Florida has required a set of vaccines for children attending public or private school from kindergarten to 12th grade – unless they fill out a form invoking a religious or medical exemption. Those vaccines are mandated to prevent life-threatening illnesses such as measles, mumps, and rubella, polio, tetanus, Hepatitis B, and many more.
State officials’ push to end vaccine mandates accompany new policy announcements that align with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s agenda called “Make America Healthy Again.”
DeSantis said Wednesday that Florida will create a MAHA commission and “recommend state-level integration” of the movement’s policies, which includes “individual medical freedom,” “informed consent,” and “parent rights.”
Experts have raised concerns with RFK Jr’s MAHA initiativesbecause of hishistory ofpromoting health conspiracy theories, suchas the false claim that vaccines are linked to autism.
Since becoming HHS chief,Kennedy has sought to undermine vaccinesby firing members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory board;hiring fellow vaccine skeptics;reducing the CDC’s communications with the public, andcanceling studies on mRNA vaccines.
Ladapo has also peddled health-related conspiracy theoriesby questioning vaccinesas well as fluoride in water.
“Who am I as a government or anyone else, or as a man standing here now, to tell you what you should put in your body? Who am I to tell you what your child should be putting in their body? I don’t have that right,” Ladapo said Wednesday, to a round of applause from the audience.
Every state requires vaccines for school-aged children to prevent the spread of deadly diseases.
Multiplestudies, spanning decades, have shown that state laws requiring childhood vaccines have “remarkable” impact on lowering the spread of preventable diseases, “particularly in school-aged populations.”
Without state requirements for children, vaccination rates against those preventable diseases, and others, could drop and have devastating consequences.
The CDCestimatesthat childhood vaccines save more than four million lives every year worldwide.
Time and time again, areas of the country with low childhood vaccination rates have seen fast-moving and lethal outbreaks of diseases, such as measles.
This past year, more than 760 people were infected with measles in West Texas, where kindergartenvaccination rates were 82 percent, far below the levels neededfor herd immunity which is around 93 percent. Two unvaccinated children, aged six and eight, died as a result.
Immunization rates among Florida kindergartners have dropped significantly over the last five years,according to the Florida Department of Health. In 2020, 93.5 percent of kindergarteners were vaccinated. In 2024, that number has dropped to 89.8 percent.
In 2018, when the state’s kindergarten vaccination rate dropped to 91.1 percent, the state saw an uptick in measles cases, with at least 15 reported.
Florida Representative Anna Eskamani, a Democrat, called the decision a “public health disaster in the makeing.”
“Ending vaccine mandates is reckless and dangerous. It will drive down immunization rates & open the door to outbreaks of preventable diseases, putting children, seniors, and vulnerable Floridians at risk.”Eskamani wrote.
The Independenthas asked the White House and Department of Health and Human Services for comment.

The chief executive, Alexei Sinitsyn, is believed to have died by suicide, according to a law enforcement sourcecitedby the Vedomosti business newspaper.
Investigatorstoldstate news agencies that Sinitsyn’s body was found with an attached towing cable under a bridge outside the city of Kaliningrad. They said they wereestablishingthe circumstances of his death.
Sinitsyn, 43, was the CEO of K-Potash Service, which has been developing the Nivensky-1 potassium-magnesium deposit in Kaliningrad since 2014. The ambitious project was originally planned to be launched in 2021, but has since beenpushed backto 2032.
Former Kaliningrad region Governor Anton Alikhanov, who now serves as Russia’s Industry and Trade Minister, once touted the Nivensky-1 deposit project as one that could make the region a global leader in chlorine-free fertilizers.
According to corporate filingscitedby the investigative outlet Agentstvo, the Dutch-registered company Vyrex B.V. owns K-Potash Service outright.
Authorities have not yet publicly commented on Sinitsyn’s death.

These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work ""discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership."" We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work,we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just$2.It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us."

The IDF said the Israeli Air Force carried out a strike in the heart of Doha, the Qatari capital, in an attempt to eliminate the leadership of the Hamas terrorist organization. Explosions were reported in one of the city's neighborhoods.
According to the IDF and the Shin Bet security agency, the targeted strike was aimed at senior Hamas leaders who have directed the group's activities for years. The army said those leaders were directly responsible for the October 7 massacre and for overseeing the ongoing war against Israel.
A senior Israeli official toldIsrael Hayomthat the strike in Qatar targeted the Hamas leadership, including Khalil al-Hayya and Jabarin. He said Israel is awaiting the results of the strike. According to the official, there is consensus within Israel's political and military leadership on the operation.
Prime Minister's Office:
Today's action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation.
Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it, and Israel takes full responsibility.
â Prime Minister of Israel (@IsraeliPM)September 9, 2025
The military emphasized that steps were taken ahead of the strike to minimize harm to civilians, including the use of precision munitions and additional intelligence.

Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said it was a cowardly Israeli strike that hit the residential headquarters of several members of Hamas' political bureau, calling it a criminal attack that violates international laws and conventions and poses a dangerous threat to the security of Qataris and others present in Qatar.
The leadership of theHamas terrorist organization is based in the city, with its offices located in the Al-Qatara neighborhood in the heart of the capital.

The footage was taken during a military parade in Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. A microphone picked up this conversation between the leaders.
Reuters edited and distributed the four-minute video to over a thousand international media outlets, including the world's leading television networks. Other agencies licensed by CCTV distributed similar materials.

The letter stated that the license terms had been exceeded and criticised the ""editorial treatment applied to this material,"" but it did not provide any details.
Reuters withdrew the video because it no longer had legal permission to publish this copyrighted content. However, the agency emphasised that it defends the accuracy of the published content and sees no violation of its standards of impartial journalism.
Chinese state media and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not reply to Reuters’ request for comment. Nevertheless, the story of Putin and Xi's conversation has already been widely spread in the global media and on social media.

Within 24 hours, three explosions in Russia’s Penza and Saratov regions disabled major oil and gas pipelines supplying military forces attacking Ukraine, intelligence sources told Kyiv Post.
A series of explosions early on Monday, Sept. 8, knocked out key gas pipelines in the Russian city of Penza, disrupting infrastructure that supplied military facilities, Ukrainian intelligence sources told Kyiv Post.
At least four blasts rocked the Zheleznodorozhny district of Penza around 4 a.m., damaging two mainline gas conduits with a combined capacity of up to two million barrels per day, according to Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (HUR). The sources said two additional regional pipelines at the same site were also hit.
Follow our coverage of the war on the@Kyivpost_official.
Penza lies about 625 kilometers (388 miles) southeast of Moscow in Russia’s Volga region, a major industrial hub connected to key energy transit routes.
Kyiv Post has not been able to independently verify the explosions.
Within hours, local media in Penza published reports claiming that the incidents were part of “planned exercises” involving emergency and security services. Officials urged residents to remain calm and ignore messages circulating on social media about explosions.
The damaged pipelines supplied Russian military sites involved in Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, HUR sources added.
Russian authorities have not publicly acknowledged the blasts, and independent confirmation of the extent of the damage was not immediately available.
And in addition, another strike was reported overnight in Russia’s Saratov region.Around 1 a.m. local time on Sept. 8, a powerful explosion hit the Kuibyshev–Lysychansk trunk oil pipeline in the Krasnoarmeysky district, according to sources in HUR.
The conduit, with an annual capacity of 82 million tons, supplied fuel to Russia’s occupying forces. Local social media accounts said workers were deployed to the site in the morning to repair the damage.
It marked the third oil and gas infrastructure facility in Russia disabled within 24 hours, following blasts that struck pipelines in the Penza region. As in previous cases, Russian media described the incident as part of “planned exercises.”
The Penza blasts follow a string of earlier Ukrainian intelligence operations targeting Russia’s energy infrastructure.
On Aug. 13, Ukrainian kamikaze dronesstruck the Unecha oil pumping station in Russia’s Bryansk region, a major hub of the Druzhba pipeline system owned by Transnefteprodukt. According to Kyiv Post’s sources in HUR, the raid was conducted jointly with other Ukrainian defense units.
Local reports said a series of explosions was followed by a large fire, prompting Russian emergency services to respond. Unecha lies just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Ukrainian border and serves as the largest node of the Druzhba network, which spans some 9,000 kilometers (5,592 miles) and supplies fuel critical to Russia’s military-industrial complex.
On Monday Kyiv Post reported that explosionsstruck a Russian National Guard unit near Khabarovskon Sept. 8, killing and injuring servicemen from a battalion accused of committing war crimes in Ukraine’s Kyiv region, according to Kyiv Post Ukrainian intelligence sources.
The blasts occurred around 9 a.m. in the parking lot of Military Unit 6912 as troops were arriving for duty,HURsaid. Two explosive devices detonated in succession, leaving casualties among the personnel.

One of the Gaza-bound vessels carrying aid and pro-Palestinian activists including Greta Thunberg was struck by a drone, the flotilla organisers have claimed.
Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF)posted footage on Instagramthat appeared to show the Portuguese-flagged vessel being hit by an object, and said all six passengers and crew were safe after the incident outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said.
Tunisian authorities quoted by Reuters said reports a drone was involved ""had no basis in truth"", adding an initial inspection indicated the explosion originated inside the vessel.
The humanitarian aid flotilla set sail from Barcelona last week, andarrived in Tunisia on Sunday.
The GSF said their ""Family boat"" was struck in Tunisian waters, and fire had damaged the main deck.
In a series of videos published to their Instagram, spokespeople for the GSF said an ""incendiary device"" caused a fire onboard the vessel, which the crew was able to extinguish.
A spokesperson for the Tunisian national guard also told the AFP news agency ""no drone"" had been detected and the investigation was continuing.
BBC Verify has authenticated several videos of a claimed strike on the ""Family"" vessel off the coast of Tunisia.
David Heathcote, Head of Intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services, told the BBC the nature of the impact angle in footage implies ""that the object has been dropped, rather than launched or fired"".
""If so, it could be that a drone was used to manoeuvre over the ship before the package was released on to it,"" he said.
""Regardless of the method of delivery, the impact video casts serious doubt on the Tunisian authorities' version of events,"" Mr Heathcote added.
United Nations Human Rights Council special rapporteur and Tunisian resident Francesca Albanese, who was also featured in videos shared by the GSF, said that if an attack could be verified it would be an ""assault and aggression against Tunisia, and Tunisian sovereignty"".
In a post to 'X', she said she was at Sidi Bou Said port and ""trying to figure out the facts with local authorities"".
Albanese has been a prominent critic of Israel's military offensive in Gaza, and has been subject to sanctions imposed by the US in July - a decision welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who called them a ""firm measure against the mendacious smear campaign"" against Israel.
Flotilla organisers have said the aim of their mission is to ""break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza"", but have faced several setbacks.
In June, Israeli forces boarded a boat carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza and detained the 12 activists onboard, including Swedish activist Thunberg.
Israeli authorities escorted the activists to the port of Ashdod before deporting them from the country.
Israeli authorities have characterised the attempts to sail aid to Gaza as publicity stunts that offered no real humanitarian assistance.
There have also been prior allegations of drone attacks on aid ships bound for Gaza; the Freedom Flotilla alleged that its ship The Conscience was struck by a drone in May off the coast of Malta.
The BBC was sent a recording of the distress call from the flotilla ship, recorded by a crew member on a nearby oil tanker. The captain of the flotilla ship can be heard reporting drone strikes and a fire onboard.
The Maltese government said everyone aboard the ship was ""confirmed safe"" and that a fire onboard the ship was ""brought under control overnight"".
Last month a UN-backed body confirmed that there was famine in Gaza and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's ""systematic obstruction"" of aid entering Gaza.
The report was labelled an ""outright lie"" by Israel, which has denied there is starvation in the territory.
In March, it introduced a nearly three-month total blockade on supplies entering the Strip, claiming the aid was being taken by Hamas.
It started allowing a limited amount of aid back into the territory after increasing international pressure.
Israel has since tried to impose its own distribution system through the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been criticised by aid agencies.
In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara which was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza.
The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 64,522 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

reddit,r/worldnews/,https://www.dw.com/en/coca-cola-rebrands-products-in-germany-amid-us-image-crisis/a-73896635,t3_1nc4cmn,Coca-Cola rebrands products in Germany amid US image crisis,goldstarflag,2025-09-09 00:13:34,3244,390,N/A,N/A,N/A,"As the global reputation of US brands slips, some US firms are turning to unusual marketing strategies. Coca-Cola, for instance, is now promoting itself as a ""German product.""
For decades, US firms have enjoyed a strong foothold in Germany, particularly in the country's western regions, which were under the control of the Western Allies afterWorld War II.
In the immediate postwar years, US cigarettes were so highly prized on the German black market that they effectively served as currency.
Sports stars often played a role in cementing trans-Atlantic brand power. Former heavyweight boxing champion Max Schmeling, seen by many US citizens as a ""good German,"" went on to represent Coca-Cola in Germany after his career in the ring.
Decades later, East German boxing champion Henry Maske ran McDonald's franchises in the German cities of Cologne and Leverkusen.
Today, however, the climate has shifted. The image of the US in Germany has taken a major beating, raising questions about how US companies can maintain their reputation. Some US firms are now actively marketing their products as ""Made in Germany.""
The phrase ""Made in Germany"" was originally introduced by Britain's parliament in 1887 to warn consumers about supposedly inferior German goods. But the move backfired because the label quickly became a mark of quality.
Recent German media coverage has suggested that US brands are counting on the positive connotations of the label to strengthen their position in Europe's largest market. Some, like McDonald's, Germany's largest fast-food chain, have been emphasizing their significant German sourcing.
The company told DW in a statement that it sees itself as ""a long-standing partner of German agriculture"" and ""a reliable part of everyday life for many people in Germany.""
McDonald's emphasized its use of domestic supply chains, noting that 65% of its raw materials come from Germany, with pork, beef, eggs, cream, and cucumbers sourced entirely locally.
""This approach is not new for us in the German market,"" the company said, though the broader trend suggests US firms are increasingly tailoring their image to specific international audiences.
Tesla may be the clearest case of how brand perception can shift. Tesla CEOElon Musk'spolitical leanings and vocal as well as financial support for US PresidentDonald Trumphave made him one of the most polarizing figures in business.
Around the world, Tesla owners have even placed stickers on their cars reading: ""I bought this before Elon went crazy.""
The backlash has had real consequences. Tesla is not longer among the top 10 bestsellingelectric vehiclesin Germany, underscoring the power of consumer sentiment.
Skepticism toward US goodsisn't limited toGermany, Europe's biggest economy. In Canada, calls to boycott US products are also on the rise, with labels such as ""Made in Canada"" and ""Prepared in Canada"" used to steer consumer choices.
Even food giant Heinz, a quintessentially US brand, now promotes a ketchup made with Canadian tomatoes and peanut butter from Canadian-processed peanuts.
Denmark has gone a step further.SinceTrump's proposal to buy Greenland, Danish retailers have marked European alternatives to US goods with black stars on price tags.
Beverage giant Carlsberg, which bottles Coca-Cola in Denmark, has already reported declining sales linked to consumer boycotts.
Coca-Cola, perhaps more than any other US brand, appears concerned about being tied to the US government's politics.
The Atlanta-based company recently launched a ""Made in Germany"" campaign in Germany, which highlights the names of employees such as Daniel, Heike, Jana, Jessy, and Muhammed. Each is featured under the slogan: ""Made by [employee name]. Made in Germany.""
""The campaign aims to show Coca-Cola's deep roots in Germany,"" the company told DW in a statement, noting that the company had been part of German business and society for almost 100 years.
According to the company, many Germans are unaware that most Coca-Cola sold in the country is already bottled locally.
Given the current political climate, the move is widely seen as an attempt to distance the brand from US politics.

reddit,r/worldnews/,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/13/lula-trump-january-6-brazil,t3_1mq3ya2,Lula says Trump would be put on trial in Brazil if January 6 riots took place there,1-randomonium,2025-08-14 15:31:43,49815,1214,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Brazilian president’s comments come amid US attempts to pressure judges in coup trial against Trump ally Bolsonaro
The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has hit back atDonald Trump’s campaign against the South American country’s judiciary, claiming the US president would be put on trial in Brazil had the January 6 US Capitol attacks taken place there.
Trump has triggered what some experts call the greatest ever diplomatic rupture between the US andBrazilby slapping 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports and sanctioning a supreme court judge in an attempt to help his far-right ally, ex-president Jair Bolsonaro, avoid prison for allegedly trying to stage a coup after he lost the 2022 election to Lula.
Bolsonaro faces a four-decade jail sentence when the supreme court announces its verdict in the coming weeks – proceedings Trump has called a “witch-hunt” and has urged Brazilian authorities to halt.
On Wednesday, as Lula announced a rescue package for companies affected by Trump’s tariffs, Brazil’s leftwing president went on the counterattack against US attempts to pressure the five supreme court judges who will decide the fate of Bolsonaro and seven other alleged co-conspirators.
“What we are doing is something that only happens in democratic countries – judging someone based on evidence collected from witnesses and with complete presumption of innocence. This is democracy raised to the nth power … They are being judged based on the plea bargains and statements given by from people who took part in the coup attempt,” Lula said at an event in the capital Brasília.
“And I’ve said to President Trump: If what happened in the Capitol had happened in Brazil, he would be put on trial here in Brazil too,” Lula added, rejecting the idea that there was anything “arbitrary” about Bolsonaro’s trial.
Lula also rejected US criticism of the human rights situation in Brazil after the state department usedits annual human rightsreport on Tuesdayto accuse his government of undermining democratic debateand “suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro as well as journalists and elected politicians”.
Lula said: “There was really no reason to hit Brazil with tariffs and nor will we accept being told that we don’t respect human rights here in Brazil.
“Every time that our American friends decide to pick a fight with someone, they try to make the people they want to fight with look like demons,” Lula added, lamenting how the 201-year-old diplomatic relationship between the two countries was “being thrown away”.
Lula urged Brazilians not to fear the pressure campaign being waged by Trump, who avoided charges over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election after his election last year. One of Trump’s first acts as president was to issue“full, complete and unconditional”presidential pardons for about 1,500 people involved in the January 6 storming of Congress. In Brazil,141 peopleare serving prison sentences for taking part in the 8 January 2023 rightwing riots in Brasília, which were allegedly part of Bolsonaro’s coup plot.
“We shouldn’t be scared and anxious or get all excited whenever a crisis comes along. Crises exist for us to create new things. Humanity has created great things … in times of crisis,” Lula said."

The Danish foreign minister has summoned the top U.S. diplomat in Copenhagen to explain a media report alleging that American nationals linked to PresidentDonald Trumpare attempting to infiltrate Greenland and run covert influencing operations there.
Newsweekcontacted the White House and the U.S. State Department for comment via email outside normal business hours.
Earlier in the year, Trump spoke repeatedly about his quest for the U.S. to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous, resource-rich territory in the Kingdom of Denmark, for national security reasons.
Politicians in Greenland and Denmark firmly rejected the idea, but the president remained adamant.
Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Denmark's foreign minister, said in a statement to the Ritzau news agency that Denmark was aware of foreign interest in Greenland and so it was unsurprising to hear of foreign influence attempts in connection with it.
""We can ascertain that there are continuously foreign actors showing interest in Greenland and its current position within the kingdom. Therefore, it should not come as a surprise if, in the near future, we see foreign attempts to influence the kingdom's future,""Rasmussen said in his statement, originally in Danish, adding that his ministry had called in the American chargé d'affaires for a meeting.
""Any attempt at interference in the internal affairs of the kingdom will, of course, be unacceptable,"" he said.
DR had reported that at least three Americans with close connections to Trump were involved in the influencing operations, citing eight anonymous sources in both Denmark and the U.S., including government officials.
DR said it could not ascertain if the three men were working on their own initiative or given an official order, adding that they were being closely monitored by Danish authorities.
Trump told reporters in March that America will ""go as far as we have to go"" to gain control of Greenland. He also called U.S. ownership of the territory ""an absolute necessity.""
The issue had faded from the headlines after Vice PresidentJD Vancemade a scaled-back visit to Greenland with his wife,Usha Vance, in March.
The prime minister ofNATOally Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, said the Vance trip put ""unacceptable pressure"" on Greenland and Denmark.
The report by the Danish broadcaster DR about a U.S. operation and the foreign minister's reaction to it looks set to thrust the question of Trump's quest for the huge island with abundant mineral resources back into the spotlight.
Greenland is home to the Thule Air Base, an importantU.S. militaryfacility.
Polling of Greenlanders indicates little appetite on the island for being absorbed into the U.S.
President Donald Trump,asked on March 29 if he would authorize the use of military force to take control of Greenland, toldNBCNews: ""I don't take anything off the table.""
One of DR's sources,who declined to be identified, said: ""What we are seeing is the use of soft power, influence and attempts to create internal discord.""
It is not clear how, or if, the U.S. administration will go about its mission to take control of Greenland, but it is unlikely to shift its attention away from the Arctic island.

Jake Sullivan, who served as national security advisor under former President Joe Biden, weighs in on Putin's proposed offer to Zelenskyy to end the Russia-Ukraine war.
Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyreiterated on Sunday that Kyiv will not surrender any territory to Moscow, pushing back against mounting international speculation about potential land-for-peace negotiations.
""The constitution of Ukraine makes it impossible to give up territory or trade land,"" Zelenskyy said during a press conference at the European Commission on Sunday.
EUROPEAN LEADERS WILL JOIN TRUMP-ZELENSKYY MEETING, SIGNALING SOLIDARITY WITH UKRAINE
He added that Russia has repeatedly tried and failed to seize the entirety of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine for a period of 12 years. The Donbas, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, is an industrial hub, with coal mining and steel production central to Ukraine’s economy.

""Since the territorial issue is so important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at the trilateral [talks with] Ukraine, United States, Russia,"" Zelenskyy said.
The Ukrainian leader, who spoke alongsideEUCommission President Ursula von der Leyen, said that so far the Kremlin has ""given no sign that the trilateral will happen.""
PUTIN DEMANDS CONTROL OF KEY UKRAINIAN TERRITORY IN EXCHANGE FOR PEACE: EUROPEAN DIPLOMAT
""With regards to any territorial questions in Ukraine, our position is clear: international borders cannot be changed by force. These are decisions to be made by Ukraine and Ukraine alone, and these decisions cannot be taken without Ukraine at the table,"" von der Leyen said.
Their remarks came after Russian PresidentVladimir Putin'smeeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, during which the Russian leader outlined conditions for ending the war, including demands for control over parts of eastern Ukraine.

Following the meeting with the Russian leader,Trumpsignaled that Zelenskyy should take Putin's deal to end the war because ""Russia is a very big power"" and Ukraine is not. Still, SSecretary of StateMarco Rubiodismissed claims that Trump would pressure Zelenskyy to give up large swaths of its sovereign land to Russia.
""The president has said that in terms of territories, these are things that Zelenskyy is going to have to decide on,"" Rubio told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
""All the president is trying to do here is narrow down the open issues,"" Rubio said, adding that Trump is focused on ending the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.

""You can't have a peace deal between two warring factions unless both sides agree to give up something. And both sides agree that the other side gets something. Otherwise, if one side gets everything they want, that's not a peace deal. It's called surrender. And I don't think this is a war that's going to end anytime soon. On the basis of surrender,"" Rubio said.
Zelenskyysaid he hopes the upcoming meeting with European allies and Trump ""will be productive,"" contrasting it with the heated Oval Office exchange during his February visit.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Argentine President Javier Milei suffered a sweeping setback on Sunday in a Buenos Aires provincial election widely viewed as a political test for his libertarian party and a barometer for how it will perform in crucial congressional midterms next month.
Milei’s recently formedLa Libertad Avanzaparty captured just 34% of the vote in Argentina’s biggest province, losing by a landslide tothe left-leaning Peronist opposition, which secured 47% with the majority of ballots counted late Sunday.
Milei conceded that his right-wing party’s crushing 13-point loss to his populist rivals represented “a clear defeat.”
“We suffered a setback, and we must accept it responsibly,” Milei told grim-faced supporters at the party headquarters, his tone reflective, even chastened.
“If we’ve made political mistakes, we’re going to internalize them, we’re going to process them, we’re going to modify our actions,” he said.
Still, he vowed to stick with hissweeping economic overhaul, saying: “There will be no retreat in government policy.”

With Mileistruggling to stabilize a sputtering economyandhis close associates embroiled by a graft scandalahead of congressional midterm elections in late October, the results were being closely scrutinized for their potential to rattle investors and roil jittery global markets.
Analysts expected La Libertad Avanza to lose by a few points to the Peronists, but his allies feared that a worse-than-expected outcome in Buenos Aires province — which makes up nearly 40% of the country’s population — would galvanize his rivals at a delicate time.
Peronist leader and former PresidentCristina Fernández de Kirchnerappeared to feel on that she was getting some payback aftera corruption convictionand criticism of her economic management, which led to a crisis that Milei inherited.
“Did you see that, Milei?” the two-term former president (2007-2015) wrote on social media platform X. “Get out of your bubble, brother. … Things are getting heavy.”
Milei needs to expand his party’s tiny minority in the opposition-dominated Congress in midterms next month tofulfill his radical libertarian reformsand make good on his promise to turn the nine-time defaulter into a country capable of servicing its debts.
The Peronists are now the largest bloc in Argentina’s fragmented congress, and have used their numbers to passsocial spending measuresthat are testing Milei’s efforts to balance Argentina’s budget.
“This result is a key data point to understand the social mood — where the opposition stands, the state of Peronism and the level of support for the government in Argentina’s most important electoral district,” said Juan Cruz Díaz, the head of Cefeidas Group, a consultancy in Buenos Aires.
“While not the main national election in October, it is nonetheless a wake-up call for the government, and how it reacts will be crucial to understanding the evolving political map.”

Although Milei can boast of bringing downArgentina’striple-digit inflationover the last few months and ending the reckless spending of his Peronist predecessors, Argentines have yet to see the economic revival that was supposed to follow his harsh austerity measures.
His government hasunwound Argentina’s labyrinthine currency restrictionsas part of a$20 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, but has not yet won the trust of international financiers who could bring the investment needed to add jobs and turbocharge economic growth in the country.
“Milei has a very strong ideology, and his vision is that the state has to have a minimal impact and investments have to come from the private sector. But that hasn’t materialized yet,” said Ana Iparraguirre, an Argentine political analyst and partner at Washington-based strategy firm GBAO.
Consumer confidence is falling, unemployment is rising, and interest rates are soaring to record highs as the government repeatedly intervenes in the currency market to prop up the peso and hold down inflation in hopes of placating cash-strapped voters.
Fernández waved wildly from the balcony of her home in Buenos Aires, where the former president is serving a six-year sentenceunder house arrest, to massive crowds of supporters celebrating in the streets below.
Despite being barred from politics for life, sheremains the most influentialleader of Peronism, an ideologically flexible populist movement focused on labor rights that emerged in the 1940s from Buenos Aires province and dominated politics for decades.
Fernández gloated over Milei’s agonies on social media, arguing that thebribery scandal engulfing the president’s powerful sisterwould prove “lethal” for his electoral prospects.
“And I won’t even start on how the rest (those who still have jobs) are doing. Burdened with debt for food, rent, utilities or medications, and on top of that, with maxed-out credit cards,” she added.
The electoral results also cast a spotlight on Fernández’s former protege, Axel Kicillof, the left-wing governor of Buenos Aires province and one of Milei’s fiercest critics, revealing him as best positioned to take up the mantle of future Peronist leadership.
Kicillof gave an ebullient speech late Sunday in which he rebuked Milei andreminded voters what they’ve lostby swapping Peronist populism forMilei’s brutal spending cuts.
“The ballot boxes told Milei that public works cannot be halted. They explained to him that retirees cannot be beaten, that people with disabilities cannot be abandoned,” he told cheering supporters.
“The ballot boxes shouted that education, healthcare, science and culture cannot be defunded.”

Many South Korean workers were sent to the U.S. on questionable documents despite their misgivings and warnings about stricter U.S. immigration enforcement before last week's raid on a Hyundai site, according to workers, officials and lawyers.
For years, South Korean companies have said they struggle to obtain short-term work visas for specialists needed in their high-tech plants in the United States, and had come to rely on a grey zone of looser interpretation of visa rules under previous American administrations.
When that changed in the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, some workers were denied entry to the United States under statuses that did not fully allow work, according to interviews with more than a dozen workers from various companies, government and company officials, and immigration lawyers.

At least 25 people were killed and 18 were injured when Russian forces struck the front-line village of Yarova in Donetsk Oblast on Sept. 9, according to local authorities.
The bombing took place around 11 a.m. while local residents lined up to receive pensions, according to officials. Thecasualties includedlocal pensioners and employees of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national post service, who were delivering the payments.
Two of the injured have been hospitalized, Ukraine'sState Emergency Servicesaid in a post on social media.
""This is not a military operation — this is pure terrorism,"" Governor VadymFilashkinsaid on his Telegram channel.
Footage published by the authorities shows a damaged postal service car with several bodies lying around it.
The small village of Yarova lies roughly 20 kilometers (over 10 miles) north of the city ofSloviansk. Located near local road networks, it sits close to the front line, just 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) from areas held by Russian forces.
""Such Russian strikes must not be left without an appropriate response from the world,"" PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskysaid on social media.
""The world must not remain idle. A response is needed from the United States. A response is needed from Europe. A response is needed from the G20.""
In a later post,Zelenskysaid Russian forces ""knew exactly where they were hitting, they saw exactly that they were hitting civilians.""
Throughout the full-scale war, Russia has relentlessly targeted civilian areas, striking both major cities such as Kyiv and front-line communities, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties.
At leastsix civilians were killedand 10 were injured on Sept. 8 in Russian attacks againstDonetsk Oblast, an eastern region partially occupied by Russia since 2014.
Recent months saw Russia ramp up its attacks on Ukrainian cities despite months-long efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end to the hostilities.
European officials have denounced the latest attack, withEstonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahknacalling it a ""shocking display of the inhumanity shown by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and his army.""
""It is long past time to roll up the red carpet for him,"" Estonia's top diplomat said in apparent reference to the welcome Putin received from Trump during theAlaska summiton Aug. 15.
""Is this what Russia means when it talks about peace?"" European Council PresidentAntonio Costasaid on X.
""When will Russia stop killing people? When will President Putin accept to start peace talks already accepted by President Zelensky?""

""Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones,"" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X, adding that those ""that posed a direct threat were shot down.""
Ukraine's Air Force said Russia launched 415 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones, 42 cruise missiles, and one Iskander-M ballistic missile overnight.
The bombing took place around 11 a.m. while local residents lined up to receive pensions, according to officials. The casualties included local pensioners and employees of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national post service, who were delivering the payments.
The number includes 990 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the request while dialing into a high-level meeting between senior U.S. and EU officials in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 9.
Von der Leyen, who began her second five-year term last year, plans to focus on strengthening Europe’s defense posture and boosting economic competitiveness, especially in response to Russia’s war against Ukraine.
A school in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast has been named after Michael Gloss, the son of CIA official who was killed while fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine, independent Russian media outlet Mediazona reported on Sept. 9.
""The Russian army's losses since the beginning of the year have already reached almost 300 thousand (299,210) people,"" Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported Sept. 9.
Under the contract, Shell — the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) trader — will deliver around 200 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas annually to MVM starting in January 2026.
The arrest was the result of cooperation between Poland's Internal Security Agency (ABW) and its counterparts in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania and Moldova, Tomasz Siemoniak, the Minister Coordinator for Polish intelligence services, wrote on X.

Russia’s Medvedev claimed that Finland’s efforts to strengthen its border against a potential Russian invasion are actually preparations to invade Russia.
WhileFinlandshores up its defenses near the Russian border, Dmitry Medvedev, former Russian president and prime minister, said that “Helsinki is pursuing a confrontational course of preparation for war with Russia, apparently preparing a springboard for an attack on us.”
The statement was part of anopinion piece by Medvedevpublished in Russian media outlet TASS. In his column Medvedev also addresses his concerns about Finland having joined NATO, and NATO opening a new regional land forces command center in Mikkeli (Finland), near the Russian border. The NATO exercises which were held the last two years were also addressed as provocative by the former Russian president.

Both Russia and Finland are increasing their fortifications. Last month Finland announced that it isfortifying its borderand last weekend Russia announced that it isfortifying its border with Finlanddue to Finland’s unfriendly actions.
Finland joined NATO in April 2023 to strengthen its security against Russian aggression, prompted by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Annualrevisions to nonfarm payrolls datafor the year prior to March 2025 showed a drop of 911,000 from the initial estimates, according to a preliminary report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total revision was on the high end of Wall Street expectations, which ranged from a low around 600,000 to as many as a million.
The revisions were more than 50% higher than last year's adjustment and the largest on record going back to 2002. On a monthly basis, they suggest average job growth of 76,000 less than initially reported.
The numbers, which are adjusted from data in the quarterly census and reflect updated information on business openings and closings, add to evidence that the employment picture in the U.S. is weakening.
Most of the time span for the report came before PresidentDonald Trumptook office, indicating the jobs picture was deteriorating before he began levying tariffs against U.S. trading partners.
""The BLS' preliminary benchmark revisions to nonfarm payrolls show a much weaker labor market over most of 2024 and early 2025 than previously estimated,"" said Oren Klachkin, market economist at Nationwide Financial. ""Importantly, the slower job creation implies income growth was also on a softer footing even prior to the recent rise in policy uncertainty and economic slowdown we've seen since the spring. This should give the Fed more impetus to restart its cutting cycle.""
Tuesday's revisions are not by themselves a reflection of current conditions as they go back as much as a year and a half. However, recent months' data also has been pointing to a soft labor market. The summer months of June, July and August saw average payroll growth of just 29,000 per month, below the break-even level for keeping the unemployment rate steady.
The largest markdowns came in leisure and hospitality (-176,000), professional and business services (-158,000) and retail trade (-126,200). Most sectors saw downward revisions, though transportation and warehousing and utilities had small gains. Almost all the revisions were confined to the private sector; government jobs were adjusted down by 31,000.
Stocksreacted little to the release, though Treasury yields erased losses and turned higher.
In addition to the economic concerns, the revisions also bring added heat to the BLS, which has been under fire from the White House for its data collection methods and results.
Following a weak jobs report for July that featured substantial downward revisions, President Donald Trump fired then-BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni as her successor. However, the August payrolls count was actually lower than July's and also featured revisions that took down the June total to a loss of 13,000 jobs, the first negative total since December 2020.
""Today, the BLS released the largest downward revision on record proving that President Trump was right: Biden's economy was a disaster and the BLS is broken,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. ""This is exactly why we need new leadership to restore trust and confidence in the BLS's data on behalf of the financial markets, businesses, policymakers, and families that rely on this data to make major decisions.""
The benchmark revisions differ from the monthly adjustments in that they are far more encompassing.
Where the monthly moves come from additional survey data that comes in to the BLS, the annual revisions stem from more comprehensive information from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages as well as tax data that essentially offers a full do-over on the data, rather than the incremental course corrections of the monthly reports.
Moreover, the numbers announced Tuesday will face further revisions when the BLS releases the final benchmark figure in February 2026.
For the previous benchmark revision, which encompassed the 12 months prior to March 2024,the initial total was 818,000 fewer jobs, later adjusted in February 2025 to 598,000, still the largest downward move since 2009.
As a share of the 171 million member labor force, the revisions amount to 0.6%. However, the political and economic ramifications could be considerable.
Additional signs of labor market weakness will add to the case that Trump has been pressing for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
The White House statement added that Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""has officially run out of excuses and must cut the rates now.""

WASHINGTON (AP) — Law enforcement officials on Sunday removed a peace vigil that had stood outside the White House for more than four decades after President Donald Trump ordered it to be taken down as part of the clearing of homeless encampments in the nation’s capital.
Philipos Melaku-Bello, a volunteer who has manned the vigil for years, told The Associated Press that the Park Police removed it early Sunday morning. He said officials justified the removal by mislabeling the memorial as a shelter.

“The difference between an encampment and a vigil is that an encampment is where homeless people live,” Melaku-Bello said. “As you can see, I don’t have a bed. I have signs and it is covered by the First Amendment right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.”
The White House confirmed the removal, telling AP in a statement that the vigil was a “hazard to those visiting the White House and the surrounding areas.”
Taking down the vigil is the latest in a series of actions the Trump administration has ordered as part of its federaltakeover of policingin the city, which began last month. The White House has defended the intervention as needed to fulfill Trump’s executive order on the “beautification” of D.C.

Melaku-Bello said he’s in touch with attorneys about what he sees as a civil rights violation. “They’re choosing to call a place that is not an encampment an encampment just to fit what is in Trump’s agenda of removing the encampments,” he said.
The vigil was started in 1981 by activist William Thomas to promote nuclear disarmament and an end to global conflicts. It is believed to be the longest continuous anti-war protest in U.S. history. When Thomas died in 2009, other protesters like Melaku-Bello manned the tiny tent and the banner, which read “Live by the bomb, die by the bomb,” around the clock to avoid it being dismantled by authorities.
The small but persistent act of protest was brought to Trump’s attention during an event at the White House on Friday.

Brian Glenn, a correspondent for the conservative network Real America’s Voice, told Trump the blue tent was an “eyesore” for those who come to the White House.
“Just out front of the White House is a blue tent that originally was put there to be an anti-nuclear tent for nuclear arms,” Glenn said. “It’s kind of morphed into more of an anti-American, sometimes anti-Trump at many times.”

Trump, who said he was not aware of it, told his staff: “Take it down. Take it down today, right now.”
Melaku-Bello said that Glenn spread misinformation when he told the president that the tent had rats and “could be a national security risk” because people could hide weapons in there.
“No weapons were found,” he told AP. “He said that it was rat-infested. Not a single rat came out as they took down the cinder blocks.”

reddit,r/news/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp98zg2k2xko,t3_1nbmx0r,Rick Davies: Supertramp singer and co-writer dies at 81,EnergyLantern,2025-09-08 12:52:40,1974,110,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Supertramp founder Rick Davies, who wrote and sang some of the rock band's hits, has died at the age of 81.
The English vocalist and keyboardist died on Saturday, a decade after being diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, the band said.
""As co-writer, along with partner Roger Hodgson, he was the voice and pianist behind Supertramp's most iconic songs, leaving an indelible mark on rock music history,"" a statement said. ""His soulful vocals and unmistakable touch on the Wurlitzer became the heartbeat of the bands' sound.""
Davies wrote songs including 1974's Bloody Well Right, their US chart breakthrough; and 1979's Goodbye Stranger.
Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1944, Davies started off in a series of bands including one called The Joint. They didn't make it big but did attract the support of Dutch millionaire Stanley August Miesegaes, who offered to back Davies if he started a new group.
So Davies put an advert for new bandmates in Melody Maker magazine in 1969, and Supertramp were born, with funding from Miesegaes for their first few years.
Davies shared writing and vocals with Hodgson, and the band found chart success with their third album, Crime of the Century, in 1974.
They made it big in the USA five years later with the album Breakfast In America, which included hit singles The Logical Song and the title track, as well as Goodbye Stranger.
The LP sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 1980, including album of the year.
Relations between the two frontmen soured, however, and Hodgson left the group in 1983.
Davies continued to record and tour with Supertramp. They announced a reunion tour in 2015, but it was cancelled when Davies was diagnosed with cancer.
""Beyond the stage, Rick was known for his warmth, resilience, and devotion to his wife Sue, with whom he shared over five decades,"" the band added in their statement.
""After facing serious health challenges, which kept him unable to continue touring as Supertramp, he enjoyed performing with his hometown buds as Ricky and the Rockets.
""Rick's music and legacy continue to inspire many and bears testament to the fact that great songs never die, they live on.""
Supertramp's classic line-up also included bassist Dougie Thomson, saxophonist John Helliwell and drummer Bob Siebenberg.
In 1977, Davies and Hodgson agreed to reduce their 50% share of songwriting royalties in order to give the trio and the band's manager a cut - a move Hodgson said was intended ""to keep the band functioning and happy"".
That arrangement lasted until 2018, and Thomson, Helliwell and Siebenberg sued Hodgson and Davies in 2021.
Davies settled out of court in 2023. Last month, a US appeals court ruled that Hodgson must share royalties with his ex-bandmates.

Updated on:  September 2, 2025 / 5:40 PM EDT/ CBS News
President Trump announced Tuesday afternoon that U.S. Space Command headquarters is moving fromColorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama.
In 2018 he had signed an order reestablishing U.S. Space Command, after it had been absorbed in 2002 into U.S. Strategic Command. Its main goal is to find ways todefendU.S. interests in space. In 2023, President Joe Biden haddecidedinstead to keep Space Command headquarters in Colorado, where its temporary headquarters was located, overturning Mr. Trump's first-term decision to move it to Alabama.
Biden had been convinced by the head of Space Command at the time that moving its headquarters would jeopardize military readiness. His reversal prompted the House Armed Services Committee, chaired by Republican Mike Rogers of Alabama, to request the Pentagon's watchdog investigate the basing decision.
The Defense Department inspector general said in a report that Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, would be the Air Force's preferred location for the command, but building facilities equal to the ones that were already in Colorado could take three to four years. According to the IG's report, Army Gen. James Dickinson, then the commander of U.S. Space Command, voiced concerns about the timeline's impact on the command's readiness, which contributed to the decision Biden had made to keep the headquarters in Colorado.
Colorado's entire congressional delegation criticized the Trump administration's decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs to Huntsville, Alabama, and warned the relocation would harm not only the state, but also the country.
""We are united in fighting to reverse this decision,"" Colorado's two senators and eight House members said in a joint statement. ""Bottom line — moving Space Command headquarters weakens our national security at the worst possible time. Moving Space Command sets our space defense apparatus back years, wastes billions of taxpayer dollars, and hands the advantage to the converging threats of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.""
The lawmakers said that Space Command's presence in Colorado Springs has created a civilian workforce that it now relies on, and said these businesses and their employees will not move with the command.
""Moving Space Command would not result in any additional operational capabilities than what we have up and running in Colorado Springs now,"" they said. ""Colorado Springs is the appropriate home for U.S. Space Command, and we will take the necessary action to keep it there.""
Colorado is represented in Congress by Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet. It's delegation in the House includes Democratic Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse, Jason Crow and Brittany Pettersen, and Republicans Jeff Hurd, Lauren Boebert, Jeff Crank and Gabe Evans.
The president criticized a decision from a federal appeals court Friday thatfound many of his tariffs are unlawfuland said it was handed down by a ""liberal court.""
""Without the tariffs, this country is in serious, serious trouble,"" Mr. Trump said.
He said that the judges who ruled against his administration in the challenge to the tariffs would like to see the ""trillions of dollars that are pouring into our country"" taken away.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a 7-4 decision that the president exceeded his authority in imposing the tariffs under an emergency powers law.
Mr. Trump said his administration will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court on Wednesday and ask it to expedite consideration of the case.
""We're asking for an expedited ruling,"" he said.
The Federal Circuit's ruling will not take effect until Oct. 14, to allow the Trump administration to seek review by the Supreme Court.
Mr. Trump told reporters that the U.S. ""over the last few minutes"" had shot at aboat carrying drugsfrom Venezuela.
""When you come out and you leave, you'll see that we just — over the last few minutes — literally shot out a boat, a drug-carrying boat, lotta drugs on that boat."" He added that it had come from Venezuela and said he'd just been briefed by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on the operation.
Soon after the president's comment, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in aposton X, ""As @potus just announced moments ago, today the U.S. military conducted a lethal strike in the southern Carribean against a drug vessel which had departed from Venezuela and was being operated by a designated narco-terrorist organization.""
Mr. Trump told reporters that he will be sending members of the National Guard into Chicago, but did not say when he would deploy the military as part of a crack down on illegal immigration, violent crime and civil unrest.
""We're going in,"" he said. ""I didn't say when, but we're going in.""
Mr. Trump called Chicago a ""hellhole"" and said he has an obligation to make sure U.S. cities are safe. He urged Gov. JB Pritzker and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, both Democrats, to call him for assistance in curbing crime.
Taking questions from reporters, Mr. Trump said that several groups of experts had recommended Huntsville as a good location for U.S. Space Command and said Alabama's congressional delegation had pushed him to relocate it to their state.
""They fought harder for it than anybody else,"" he said. Pointing to the Alabama lawmakers who joined him in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said ""they spoke to me a lot. That's all they wanted to talk about.""
Appearing in the Oval Office alongside Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Alabama's congressional delegation, Mr. Trump formally announced that U.S. Space Command headquarters will move to the ""beautiful locale"" of Huntsville, Alabama. He said the city will be known as ""Rocket City.""
""Seven years in the making,"" he said, adding that the change will bring thousands of jobs to the area.
The president extended his gratitude to Colorado, where U.S. Space Command is currently headquartered, but he criticized the state's use of mail ballots.
""That played a big factor,"" he said.
In Colorado, every registered voter receives a mail ballot.
Mr. Trump said that in the future, U.S. Space Command would play a role in building the""Golden Dome,""a missile defense project.
Hegseth praised the move and said it will ensure the U.S. stays ""leaps and bounds ahead.""
""Whoever controls the skies will control the future of warfare,"" he said.
Vice President JD Vance called Alabama ""exactly the right place"" for U.S. Space Command and called the relocation to Huntsville a ""visionary move.""
The Air Force in 2021 settled on Huntsville, Alabama, as its preferred location for the headquartersafter weighing a number of factors, including proximity to other space agencies and support in the community for military families. Two years later, the Biden administration determined that the command would instead stay in Colorado.
Redstone Arsenal, in Huntsville, is also home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and the Missile Defense Agency.
As of fall 2024, about 1,000 out of 1,400 positions allotted for U.S. Space Command had been filled, accordingto a May Government Accountability Office report. The report found that uncertainty over the final location of the headquarters was a factor discouraging civilians from applying for jobs at the command.
U.S. Space Command was first established in 1985 and handles U.S. military operations, according to aJune reportfrom the Congressional Research Service. But in 2002, Space Command's assets and responsibilities were transferred to U.S. Strategic Command by Congress, and it was disestablished. Then, a defense policy bill approved by lawmakers in 2018 reconstituted Space Command as a subordinate unified command under U.S. Strategic Command. A year later, during Mr. Trump's first term, he elevated Space Command to one of 11 unified combatant commands within the Defense Department.
The current commander of Space Command isGen. Stephen Whiting. According to the CRS, published a month after a Government Accountability report on the command, here are roughly 1,700 personnel assigned to Space Command's headquarters at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs, and 18,000 joint force personnel stationed around the world in support of its efforts, Whiting told the Senate Armed Services Committee last year.
The president's expected announcement from the Oval Office will be his first public appearance in a week, when he held a meeting with hisCabinet. Mr. Trump spent the long weekend golfing at his private club located outside of Washington, D.C.

Two teenagers were arrested Friday on murder charges in the killing of a congressional intern who was struck by stray bullets during a shooting in Washington DC – a crime that Donald Trump cited in deploying national guard troops in the US capital during the presidential administration’slaw enforcement interventionthere.
Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, of Granby, Massachusetts, was fatally shot on the night of 30 June near Washington’s Mount Vernon Square. Both suspects in his killing – Kelvin Thomas Jr and Jailen Lucas – are 17 years old, but are being charged as adults with first-degree murder while armed, according to US attorney Jeanine Pirro.
Police were searching for a third suspect whose name and age weren’t immediately released.
Tarpinian-Jachym was an “innocent bystander” who wasn’t an intended target of the gunfire, Pirro said at a news conference where she was flanked by theWashington DCmayor Muriel Bowser and the city’s police chief.
“Eric didn’t deserve to be gunned down and the system failed him – the system that felt that juveniles needed to be coddled,” Pirro said. “This killing underscores why we need the authority to prosecute these younger kids, because they’re not kids. They’re criminals.”
Tarpinian-Jachym was a rising senior at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He was in Washington to work as a summer intern in the office of Republican congressman Ron Estes of Kansas.
In July, the House observed a moment of silence after Estes paid tribute to Tarpinian-Jachym, calling him “a dedicated, and thoughtful and kind person who loved our country”.
“We will never forget his presence and kindness in my office,” Estes said. “Those he met in his short term in my office will not forget him, either.”
Trump mentioned Tarpinian-Jachym’s killing – but not his name – during an 11 August news conference where he announced the federal intervention in the District of Columbia.
“Any level of gun violence in our city is unacceptable,” Bowser said.
The suspects, both DC residents, exited a vehicle at an intersection and shot at two people riding bikes, including a 16-year-old male who was wounded, according to Kevin Kentish, aWashington DCmetropolitan police department (MPD) commander.
Tarpinian-Jachym was struck by four shots. A woman who wasn’t a target was also shot, but survived, according to Kentish. Surveillance video helped investigators identify the three suspects, he said.
Online court records didn’t immediately identify attorneys for the suspects.
Pamela Smith, the MPD chief, said she and Pirro spoke to Tarpinian-Jachym’s mother on Friday.
“Eric came to our city with a bright future ahead of him,” Smith said. “He deserved an opportunity to return home safely to his family, but was senselessly taken from his loved ones.”"

The illness has potentially infected between 70,000 and 100,000 Californians.
I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read ourPrivacy notice
Up to 100,000Californianshave been infected with apotentially fatal disease— without even knowing it.
Chagas disease, caused by aparasitethat lives inside so-called “kissing bugs,” has been reported in California and 29 other U.S. states,according to theLos Angeles Times.
The illness, which has potentially infected between 70,000 and 100,000 California residents, lies dormant for years, only making itself known when victims suffer serious cardiac issues, including heart attacks or strokes.
There are roughly a dozen species of the blood-sucking kissing bugs in the U.S., and four are found in California. SomeLos Angeleshotspots, including Griffith Park, are teeming with bugs infected with the Chagas disease parasite. A third of all kissing bugs at the famous park and observatory carry the parasite, and the disease has been detected in local wildlife, including wood rats, skunks and mice, according to the report.
“This is a disease that has been neglected and has been impacting Latin Americans for many decades,” Norman Beatty, an epidemiologist and Chagas disease expert, told theTimes. “But it’s also here in the United States.”
Due to its prevalence in the U.S., researchers are now calling on the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to classify the disease as endemic, which means it is consistently present.
California has more residents who have been infected with Chagas disease, which is caused by the parasiteTrypanosoma cruzi, than any other state, in part due to there being so many residents who come from countries where the disease is endemic, according to the report. A study by California’s Department of Health found that 31 of 40 human cases reported between 2013 and 2023 were acquired in other countries. Officials could not rule out local transmission for the remaining cases.
While the disease was once only found in more rural parts of Mexico and Central and South America, it is now present in at least 30 U.S. states. About 8 million people globally and an estimated 280,000 in the U.S. have Chagas disease without even knowing it,according to the CDC.
Doctors and physicians are not required to report cases of the disease in California, as they would have to for other diseases such as influenza, Lyme and malaria, meaning cases are likely vastly underreported. Gabriel Hamer, an entomologist, told theTimesthat confirmed human cases in the U.S. represent “just the tip of the iceberg,” and that no one truly knows the true total.
“There’s no standardized reporting system. There’s no active surveillance,” Hamer said.
According to Hamer, many people only discover they have Chagas after trying to donate blood.
Chagas can cause acute reactions, including swollen limbs, eyes and anaphylaxis, though its longer-term effects, such as seizures or strokes, are much more dangerous.
Other symptoms include fever, feeling tired, body aches, headaches, rash, a loss of appetite, diarrhea, vomiting and eyelid swelling. These symptoms may be mild but would appear in the first weeks or months after infection, according to the CDC.
The disease, while curable if antiparasitic treatment is provided early on, can often lead to sometimes fatal cardiac issues, including heart attacks or strokes.

Erin Patterson has been sentenced to life in prison with 33 years non-parole, for murdering three in-laws — and attempting to murder a fourth — by lacing their beef Wellingtons with poisonous death cap mushrooms in 2023.
The prosecution had called for Patterson to be jailed for life with no parole.
Patterson's lawyer conceded a life sentence was appropriate but urged Justice Christopher Beale to set a minimum term to give Patterson the chance to walk free by the time she is in her 80s.
Justice Beale says the jury saw through her ""vague story"" about purchasing mushrooms from an Asian grocer.
Look back at the day's developments in the blog.
By Madi Chwasta
Thank you for joining our live coverage of Erin Patterson's sentencing.
To recap, Patterson was sentenced to life in prison with a 33 year non-parole period for three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.
And to wrap up our live coverage, the ABC's court reporterKristian Silvahas shared his reflections covering this case.
By Judd Boaz
""The courts set a non-parole period for most prisoners who are sentenced to imprisonment for a maximum term of life,""the Adult Parole Board of Victoria says.
So while Patterson was handed a life sentence, she may not spend the rest of her live in prison.
Her non-parole period of 33 years means she will be allowed to apply for her release from prison in 2056.
By Judd Boaz
Patterson is 50 years old, with her birthday approaching on September 30.
Provided her sentence isn’t lengthened or increased, that meansshe’ll be in her early 80swhen she’s eligible for parole – but her release won’t be guaranteed.
Patterson was arrested in 2023 and her sentence takes into account the time she has already spent behind bars.
So that meansit’ll be 2056 when she has a chance for release.
By Melissa Brown
Erin Patterson has a relatively short window from today to lodge any appeal against her conviction or sentence.
The ABC's court reporter Kristian Silva explains the likelihood of that happening:
By Melissa Brown
David Peters andMykey O'Halloranare among those who attended each day of Patterson's trial in Morwell.
Mr Peters said he welcomed today's sentence as an ""ending to the whole situation and the offending that took place"".
""I feel sorry for everybody,"" he said.
Before the hearing started, we heard from fellow court watcher Tammy Egglestone.
We caught up with her again after the sentencing.
""It's good to learn exactly how the court system works,"" she said.
""I thought [Justice Beale's sentencing] was very good. It was very direct, it was very clear.""
By Melissa Brown
Earlier this morning, we saw a large line of people hoping to secure a seat in the public gallery for the sentence.
The crowd waited outside court until Patterson's prison van departed, with members of the public trying to catch a glimpse and snap a photo of the notorious prisoner.
By Judd Boaz
Justice Christopher Beale gave Patterson three life sentences for the three murder charges as well as a 25-year-sentence for the attempted murder charge.
“All sentences are to be served concurrently,” he said.
That meansall those sentences will be served at the same time, rather than Patterson serving the 25 years and then a life sentence after that.
By Kristian Silva
Simon Patterson, the estranged husband of Erin Patterson, was a notable absence at today's sentencing hearing.
He was a last-minute withdrawal from the fatal lunch in 2023, and later told police he had fallen seriously ill after eating his wife's cooking.
Mr Patterson gave evidence at the trial but is yet to conduct any media interviews.
He is expected to break his silence on his own terms — as part ofhis own multi-episode podcast series.
The ABC understands Mr Patterson will be interviewed byJess O'Donnell, a public relations consultant who has been working with him for at least a year.
The series has not yet been recorded but could be released before the end of the year.
By Melissa Brown
Erin Patterson was represented by a team led by Colin Mandy SC throughout the trial.
He left today's sentencing without giving any indication about whether they would lodge any appeal.
By Melissa Brown
Just arrived on the blog?
Mushroom murderer Erin Patterson has been sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 33 years for killing Don Patterson, Gail Patterson and Heather Wilkinson, and the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson.
Here's a recap of what happened today:
By Melissa Brown
Victoria's women's prison — the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre — is in Melbourne's west, about a 40 to 45 minute drive from the Supreme Court.
Patterson arrived back there a short time ago.
She'll remain there for at least another three decades.
By Melissa Brown
Erin Patterson is on her way back to the Dame Phyllis Frost women's prison in Melbourne's west.
This is the moment she left court after receiving her life sentence.
By Judd Boaz
The ABC'sKristian Silvasaid his contacts in the legal field had told him the impact of the Erin Patterson case could not be overstated.
""I think in terms of public attention on it, it's one of the biggest cases in the last 50 years,"" he said.
""I have spoken to many experienced lawyers and reporters with decades more time under their belt than I have had, and they say this is the biggest thing that they've seen since the Lindy Chamberlain case in terms of public attention.""
Kristian said it could be decades more until we saw a court case with this much attention on it.
He also said there would also be questions raised about whether all the media attention had been warranted.
""Perhaps it's an uncomfortable discussion as well for members of the media, including us, who have inevitably fueled what has been a frenzied interest in this case since the deaths of those lunch guests two years ago,"" he said.
By Judd Boaz
The prison van holding Erin Patterson has now left the Supreme Court, and is headed back to the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre.
As we heard today, Erin Patterson faces at least 33 years behind bars.
By Judd Boaz
The ABC's Kristian Silva says there has been no word yet from Erin Patterson's defence team.
He says they have about 28 days to appeal, and perhaps even longer.
""The courts are pretty generous and if they miss the appeal date by a few days that will be OK,"" he said.
However, the defence must have serious legal concerns about the trial or how it was run. Simply being unsatisfied with the verdict won't be enough to lodge an appeal.
As for Patterson herself, she remained silent during the proceedings.
""For most of it she cut a pretty glum figure in the court dock,"" Kristian said.
""But as Justice Beale started going through his sentence and just talking about how blatant this crime was, Patterson shut her eyes and just appeared to be trying to sort of block it out.""
But there were no tears or emotion shown from the convicted killer.
Kristian says the huge crowd outside the Supreme Court is still waiting outside the gates for the prison van to leave.
By Judd Boaz
The ABC'sKristian Silvahas been to countless sentencing hearings over the course of his career, and described just how different the atmosphere felt in the Supreme Court today.
""It was a very tense atmosphere,"" he said.
""Usually in these cases when people are milling into the room before the hearing, it's actually a bit lighter than you would think.
""There's a lot of people who followed the case for a long time. Many people who sat in the room at Morwell for the trial for 10 weeks, so there's usually actually a bit of friendly chatter before the hearing starts.
""But once a judge comes on bench it's pretty tense, and, as I said, you would have heard a pin drop through that entire sentence.
""Everyone was hanging off every word that Justice Beale had to say.""

During the sentence, Justice Christopher Beale reflected on Ian Wilkinson's remarks that attention is showered on those who do evil, instead of those who do good.
Justice Beale said Erin Patterson's victims were among the latter of those two.

For more than two years following the lunch, Ian Wilkinson kept silent and remained incredibly private about his thoughts and feelings towards Erin Patterson's crimes.
With Patterson now sentenced to more than three decades behind bars, he took the opportunity to directly speak to the media for the first time since the lunch, reading from a prepared statement to dozens of reporters.

The ABC'sSacha Paynesays Ian Wilkinson did not look at Erin Patterson once during the sentence.
Instead, he focused his attention on Justice Christopher Beale.
Payne described Mr Wilkinson as remaining stoic and gracious throughout the trial and today's sentence hearing, even when hearing harrowing details about the death of his wife and family members.
She says he was accompanied to court by his daughter Ruth Dubois and her husband, Brad.

He was in Court 4 at the Supreme Court this morning, and gave us great insight into how the sentencing unfolded.
""It was pretty tense in there,"" he said.
""When that sentence came to be delivered, you could have heard a pin drop in there. It was total silence.""
For people unfamiliar with the court process and murder trials, Kristian said the sentence handed down was ""exceptional"".
""That life sentence is notsomething that is handed out forevery murder in Victoria,"" Kristian said.
""In somestates that is a mandatory thing butit is not here, so it is quiteexceptional when it happens inVictoria and that really reflectedthe gravity of this crime.""

NEW ORLEANS --The New Orleans Archdiocese on Monday agreed to a $230 million proposed settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse, attorneys for some of the survivors said Monday. The agreement paves the way for a final resolution to yearslong negotiations amid aseries of similar settlementsfrom the Catholic Church.
The archdiocese had announced in May that it would payat least $179.2 millionin response to more than 500 abuse claims, which the bloc of attorneys said they opposed because they considered it to be lowballing the hundreds of survivors.
“We knew this was a bad deal, and we knew we could do better; and we have,"" the group of 10 attorneys said in a statement. ""The ‘power of no’ forced the Archdiocese to come up with significantly more money.”
The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors point out allows church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court. The archdiocese called the updated settlement a “significant step forward for the benefit of all claimant survivors"" in an emailed statement.
Survivors have until late October to vote on whether or not to approve the settlement. If approved by two-thirds of survivors, payments could begin disbursement by next year.
“At this point, I’m not aware of a single attorney for an abuse survivor that opposes the plan,” said Brad Knapp, an attorney for a committee representing abuse survivors. “With all the abuse survivors’ attorneys supporting it, I think there’s much less chance that it gets voted down.”
The archdiocese's bankruptcy is one of the longest running and most contentious of more than a dozen ongoing Catholic Church bankruptcy cases in the U.S. related to sex abuse, according to Terence McKiernan, president of the nonprofit BishopAccountability.org.
Judge Meredith Grabill, overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings in federal court, has warned that if the settlement is not approved, then she will dismiss the case.
If a bankruptcy settlement fails, survivors would be required to seek compensation for their abuse claims through new lawsuits, which could take years to play out in courts. And it raises the prospect that the archdiocese would declare bankruptcy again to delay payments, according to a public letter from the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. The committee represents the interests of abuse survivors in the bankruptcy case and urged survivors to accept the initial settlement offer.
The committee warned that bringing individual abuse claims in court would likely lead to difficult confrontations with a “aggressive and hostile” archdiocese, which could force survivors and their friends and family to engage in tough depositions and years of appeals, exacerbating survivors’ “emotional and psychological pain.”
“A lot of survivors are ready for this to be resolved,” said Kristi Schubert, an attorney representing dozens of survivors. “A lot of them would prefer to receive certain money now.”
But some survivors, like Kevin Bourgeois, say that monetary compensation only goes so far.
“There is no dollar amount that really is equitable considering that abuse survivors live for the rest of their lives putting their lives back together,” said Bourgeois, a New Orleans native who suffered clergy sexual abuse and settled privately prior to 2020. He pointed out that the bankruptcy process allows the church to “wear people down” and keep the public in the dark about the extent to which it enabled abuse.
The settlement as outlined in May requires the archdiocese to bring in outside experts to evaluate its child-protection programs and recommend improvements. The archdiocese would also establish a document archive at a secular university related to its abuse and hold public forums for survivors to share their experiences and concerns with the archbishop.
“I remain very hopeful and committed to bringing this bankruptcy to a conclusion that benefits the survivors of abuse,” said New Orleans Archbishop Gregory M. Aymond in a Monday statement. “Please know that I pray for the survivors of abuse every day and look forward to the opportunity to meet with them to hear their stories...”
Aymond has resisted the chorus of survivors calling for his resignation over the church’s failure to take action on allegations against priests for decades.
The accusations of archdiocese clergy abuse triggered asweeping FBI probeand a cascading crisis for the Catholic Church, which drew on help from New Orleans Saints executives to help behind the scenes with damage control, anAP investigation revealed.

The Trump administration said Thursday it is abandoninga Biden-era planthat sought to require airlines to compensate stranded passengers with cash, lodging and meals for flight cancellations or changes caused by a carrier.
The proposed rule would have aligned U.S. policy more closely with European airline consumer protections. It was proposed last December in the final weeks of then-President Joe Biden's administration, leaving its fate in the hands of his Republican successor.
In a documentposted Thursday, President Donald Trump's Transportation Department said its plan to scrap the proposed rule is “consistent with Department and administration priorities.” Trump has sought to significantlyroll back or modify federal regulationsthat his administration deems are wasteful or burdensome.
Industry trade group Airlines for America, which represents carriers including United, Delta and Southwest Airlines, welcomed the move by the Trump administration.
“We are encouraged by thisDepartment of Transportationreviewing unnecessary and burdensome regulations that exceed its authority and don’t solve issues important to our customers,"" the group said Thursday in a statement.
Airlines already offer some level of customer service when they cause flight cancellations or severe delays, but passengers usually have to ask for help at the airport, and airline promises don’t carry the weight of federal rules.
But the proposed rule sought compensation starting at $200 when a flight is canceled or significantly delayed because of a mechanical problem with the plane or an airline computer outage. Compensation as high as $775 was proposed for delays of nine hours or more.
Carriers fiercely opposed it. In a public comment submitted this summer, Spirit Airlines said the rule threatened to increase operating costs for airlines and drive up ticket prices for passengers.
The budget carrierfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protectionlast week for the second time in a year. Spirit quickly followed that announcement with news that it planned to suspend operations next month in about a dozen cities.
“There is no free lunch,” Spirit said. “If every time a flight has to be cancelled due to, say, an aircraft maintenance issue, airlines were required to pay each affected passenger $300 plus hotel and meals, there would be a perverse incentive to cancel flights preemptively at any hint of trouble.”
Biden's Transportation Department was also considering free rebooking on the next available flight, including flights on rival airlines, as well as meals and lodging when passengers are stranded overnight.

NEWBERN, Ala. (AP) — The first Black mayor of a tiny Alabama town overwhelmingly won election this week, four years after white residents locked him out of the town hall and refused to let him serve.
Incumbent Mayor Patrick Braxton was elected as the mayor of Newbern, winning 66 votes to his opponent’s 26, according to results posted by the town. His victory puts a punctuation mark in the dispute over control of the town government thatdrew national attention.
“The people came out and spoke and voted. Now, there ain’t no doubt what they want for this town,” Braxton said in a telephone interview Wednesday night.
The election Tuesday was the town’s first since at least the 1960s, held under a federal settlement. Black residents had sued, challenging what they called the town’s “hand-me-down governance” and refusal to let Braxton serve after he ran unopposed for mayor in 2020.
Newbern’s residents number just 133 people. A library,the town hall, a mercantile and a flashing caution light anchor the downtown, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Selma.
What the town had been without is elections.
Newbern’s mayor-council government had not been put to a vote for six decades. Instead, town officials held “hand-me-down” positions, with each mayor appointing a successor who appointed the council members, according to the lawsuit filed by Braxton and others. The result was an overwhelmingly white government in a town where Black residents outnumber white residents 2-1.

Braxton, a volunteer firefighter, qualified in 2020 to run for the nonpartisan position of mayor, and since he was the only candidate, he became the mayor-elect without an election. He then appointed a new town council, as other mayors have done.
But the locks were changed at the town hall, and Braxton was denied access to the town’s financial accounts. His lawsuit also alleged that outgoing council members held a secret meeting to set up a special election and “fraudulently reappointed themselves as the town council.”
“I didn’t get a chance to serve but one year out of the five years,” said Braxton, who finally occupied the office last year after a three-year legal battle.
Town officials had denied wrongdoing, arguing in court filings that Braxton’s claim to be mayor was “invalid.”
The settlement agreement included a promise to hold a mayoral election in 2025.
Braxton had one challenger this time — a white auctioneer and Realtor, Laird Cole.
“Mayor Braxton’s election represents a turning point for Newbern, restoring democratic governance, ensuring fair representation, and reaffirming that every resident has a voice in their local government,” Madison Hollon, program manager of political campaigns for the SPLC Action Fund, said Thursday. The group endorsed Braxton in the race.
The mayor said his lopsided victory should eliminate any “doubts people had hanging in their heads on if people want me.”
“It feels good the second time,” Braxton said.

The democratic governors of Oregon, Washington and California are forming a new public health partnership aimed at preserving access to vaccines.
The partnership, called the Western Health Alliance, will develop its own immunization guidelines “informed by respected national medical organizations,” according to a press release Wednesday from Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“The CDC has become a political tool that increasingly peddles ideology instead of science, ideology that will lead to severe health consequences. California, Oregon, and Washington will not allow the people of our states to be put at risk,” the governors said in a joint prepared statement.
Their announcement comes after a week of chaos at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Last week, the White House fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, who was appointed by President Trump,after she refused to approvevaccine policies preferred by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Several of the agency’s top career scientists also resigned in protest. On Monday, nine former directors of the CDC, who worked under both Republicans and Democrats, condemned Kennedy’s leadership of the agencyin an op-ed in The New York Times.
Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist,responded with an op-ed of his ownin the Wall Street Journal, saying he’s “restoring the public’s trust in the CDC” andvaccine science broadlyby eliminating bias and conflicts of interest.
“We are here because our communities deserve clear and transparent communication about vaccines. Communication that is grounded in science, not ideology,” Dr. Sejal Hathi, head of the Oregon Health Authority, said at a press conference Wednesday. “We know that when guidance about vaccines becomes inconsistent and politicized, it undermines public trust at precisely the moment we need it most.”
Last week,the FDA approved the new round of COVID-19 vaccines, but limited their availability to only those who are considered high-risk.
The CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices is set to meet this month to discuss recommendations for who should get the shot,providing needed guidance to pharmacistsacross the country. Earlier this summer, Kennedy removed all 17 members from the advisory committee and has replaced them with memberswho have criticized vaccines and spread misinformationabout them.
On Monday, President Donald Trump suggested on his social media website Truth Social that drugmakers like Pfizer shouldprove to the public that COVID-19 vaccines were effective because controversy was affecting the CDC.In a press release last week,Pfizer included a linkto a presentation from May on its vaccine efficacy.

The alliance’s formation is not the first time West Coast states have partnered on public health endeavors. In 2020, the three formed the “Western States Pact” to review federal vaccine recommendations and coordinate pandemic restrictions. Oregon, Washington and California were three of the final states to lift their mask mandates.
The states also have a history in responding to national health care policy changes. As legal cases that threatened abortion medication moved through the courts, the statesall developed their own stockpilesof the drugs, mifepristone and misoprostol.
Tensions between the states and the Trump administration have been rising in other areas over the past month as well. The president has frequently said hewanted to see more immigration enforcementin so-called sanctuary states like Oregon and Washington after a notable presence in California. Newsom has also taken tomocking President Trump on social mediain recent days.
The three Democratic governors offered few specifics Wednesday as to how they hope the Western Health Alliance could influence which vaccines will be available in their states.
The Food and Drug Administration is tasked with approving new vaccines, and state legislatures generally determine which vaccines are required for school attendance.
One possibility would be bulk vaccine purchasing agreements, with more than 50 million people living in the three states combined.
Hathi said the alliance is “exploring all possible avenues for expanding access and coverage of vaccines, including coordinated purchasing and access programs.” She also said the goal is to ensure continued access to vaccines with no out-of-pocket costs.
In response to the announcement Wednesday, some Pacific Northwest Democrats in the U.S. Senate praised the move, and said changes are needed at the federal level.
“It’s important for states like Washington to step up to protect public health, but diseases don’t recognize borders,” Washington Sen. Patty Murray said in a statement. “We still need a functioning and trustworthy federal health department — for that to happen, RFK Jr. must be fired immediately.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Immigration officials said they intend to deportKilmar Abrego Garciato Uganda after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.
The Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail for the time being and then serve whatever sentence he would receive for pleading guilty, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.
Later on Friday, “the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning — precisely when he must report to ICE’s Baltimore Field Office — to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,” his defense attorneys wrote.
They declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.
Filed along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn’t face the possibility of detention.
Justice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded to the brief with a statement saying, “A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes ... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community. This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.”

Abrego Garcia’s case becamea flash pointin President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda after he was mistakenlydeported to El Salvadorin March, despite a judge’s earlier determination that he faced a “well-founded fear” of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.
Hepleaded not guiltyand asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him forchallenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.
“Despite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego’s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,” his attorneys wrote in their filing.
The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, andofficers discussedamong themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.
Abrego Garcia has an American wife and children and haslived in Marylandfor years. Although he was deemed eligible for pretrial release last month, heremained in jailat the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediatelydeport him againif he were freed. Arecent rulingin a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours’ notice before initiating deportation proceedings — time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.
“Please let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),” it states. Uganda recentlyagreed to take deporteesfrom the U.S., provided they do not have criminal records and are not unaccompanied minors.
Federal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador.
Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Abrego Garcia’s lead attorney in the Maryland lawsuit against the Trump administration, said in a statement Saturday that the government is trying to use the immigration system to punish his client by “attempting to send him halfway across the world, to a country with documented human rights abuses and where he does not even speak the language.”

The suspect also died in Thursday's attack at a First Nations community in the province of Manitoba, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
The incident took place in Hollow Water First Nation, about 200km (124 miles) north-east of the city of Winnipeg.
Police said the suspect was fleeing the scene when he died in a vehicle collision with an RCMP policewoman, who was critically injured.
The family of one victim said he was awoken in the middle of the night, and was stabbed in the torso.
Investigators said the woman killed was the sister of the suspect, and that the man was previously ""known to police"".
In a news conference, the federal police force said that officers were on site at the Hollow Water First Nation, and were ""still going house to house to make sure that the community is safe and also ensuring that there are no other victims"".
""Our sincere condolences to everyone within the community of Hollow Water First Nation and to everyone who has been affected by this senseless act of violence,"" the RCMP said.
Police said they were first called to the community at 03:45 local time on Thursday, after a tribal security officer reported an assault had taken place 30 minutes earlier.
When police arrived, they were alerted to a second crime scene. Stabbing victims were located at both locations, according to investigators.
RCMP major crimes unit Supt Rob Lasson declined to share any suspected motive for the attack, but said the ""victims were all known to each other in the community"".
The suspect, Tyrone Simard, 26, fled in a stolen car and appears to have been heading towards Winnipeg when he collided with the police vehicle.
The policewoman, who has not been named, was taken to hospital with ""critical but non-life-threatening injuries"", according to Lasson, and is expected to make a full recovery.
Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew praised the police officer, saying: ""She stopped a man on a rampage.""
Chief of Hollow Water First Nation Larry Barker also spoke at the news conference, his voice cracking with emotion.
""I ask the community to pray and support one another out there,"" Chief Barker said.
""The families were very close to me, and my deepest condolences to them,"" he continued.
The Anishinaabe community has a population of a few hundred people.
One of those injured in the attack was identified by family members as Michael Raven, according toCBC News.
His children said that he was stabbed in the lung by someone who broke into his home while he was asleep.
""The community is all shaken up from it. It is not something that happens in Hollow Water,"" his daughter, Christy Williams, told CBC.
The attack happened on the third anniversary of a mass stabbing in James Smith Cree Nation and the nearby village of Weldon, in the province of Saskatchewan, in which 11 people were killed and many more injured.
The suspect in that stabbing died shortly after police arrested him following a three-day manhunt.

The current extreme heat warning issued by the NWS is the fourth and longest of the summer thus far, and will extend at least through Wednesday night with temperatures forecast to hit 110F. Increased cloud cover and possible thunderstorms will then bring a brief respite towards the weekend but another very hot spell is forecast by the start of next week.
Maricopa county is home to Phoenix, the fifth largest and hottest major US city, as well as several smaller urban hubs dotted amid the Sonora desert including Scottsdale, Tempe and Mesa.
Midway through the hot season, the current official death count – including suspected and confirmed heat-related fatalities – is about 30% lower than this time last year, the second deadliest on record.
In 2025, the county medical examiner’s office has so far confirmed only 35 heat deaths – 17 directly caused by exposure to high temperatures, and 18 cases where heat contributed to the fatality, including by exacerbating chronic medical conditions or the effects of alcohol or methamphetamine. Another 369 suspected heat-related deaths remain under investigation, according to thecounty’s heat surveillancedashboard which is updated weekly.
June and July were a little cooler than recent years, despite topping 115F on multiple days, which at least partially explains the lower death toll. Improved access and extended hours at city cooling centres may also be playing a role, according to Dr Nick Staab, the county’s chief medical officer. First responders and hospitals have reportedly gotten better at treating heatstroke and other temperature-related emergencies.
Yet despite the encouraging numbers, Maricopa county is still on track to be the deadliest place for heat in the US after New York City, the country’s largest metropolis, where heat contributes to 525 deaths on average each year.
“With this many cases still under investigation and it only being mid-August, there’s a lot that could still happen,” Staabtold KJZZ, the local public radio station.
Heat-related deaths have soared in Maricopa county over the past decade, with 645 in 2023 compared to 61 in 2014. The county has become increasingly unlivable for many amid record-breaking heatwaves driven by the global climate crisis, unchecked urban sprawl and an affordable housing crisis – which combined with patchy mental health and substance misuse services has contributed to a growing unsheltered population.
Last year, heat deaths fell for the first time in a decade to 608, according to official figures, but the city and county have since come under fire for alleged undercounting. A recent investigation by the local TV station ABC15identified multiple casesin which heat was discounted as a factor despite the person dying in extreme temperatures.
“People are dying awful, preventable deaths that are not being accounted for in the official figures. We need more consistency and transparency if we’re going to wrap solutions around this public health crisis,” said Stacey Champion, a community advocate campaigning for more standardized counting of heat-related deaths inArizona.
Neither the city nor the county responded immediately to questions surrounding the official death toll.
Heat is the deadliest weather phenomenon. But every heat death is preventable, and often indicates a lack of access to adequate shelter, cooling and/or health, addiction and social services.
So far this year, three-quarters of heat-related deaths have occurred outside, where temperatures in the most built-up, least shady parts of Phoenix can be 20 or 30F higher on the sidewalk than the NWS’s airport weather station. Unhoused people account for 40% of deaths, while substance misuse contributed to two-thirds.
June was the 11th warmest on record, and July the ninth hottest.
The city, county and state have sought to tackle the increasingly unlivable summer environment through tree canopy initiatives, cooling technologies and an expansion of cooling centres among other policies – in part with the help of Biden-era programs and funds.
But there is little or no hope of ongoing federal support under the Trump administration, which is dismantling environmental justice programs, climate change research and mitigation efforts, as well as access to healthcare, food stamps (Snap) and other social safety nets. Currently one in four heat deaths in the county occur indoors, andenergy costs are predicted to rise significantly underTrump which risks making Maricopa county and beyond even more deadly as summers get hotter.
Meanwhile firefighters are struggling to control at least five major wildfires across the state, which have sofar burnt about 180,000 acres. Hot, dry and windy conditions are fuelling the flames in Arizona – as well as fires in California, Utah, Colorado and large swathes of Canada."

The presence of the virus had been confirmed in a 34-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted to hospital last month after showing symptoms that included a high fever and repeated vomiting, the ministry added.
She died a few hours later from multiple organ failure.
This will be the 16th outbreak of the deadly virus in the vast central African state that has poor health services, and is hit by conflict in the east.
The latest outbreak is in central Kasai province, with 28 suspected cases recorded, the ministry said.
Officials have urged strict adherence to preventive measures, including frequent handwashing and social distancing in high-risk areas.
Tests identified the Zaire strain of Ebola, a rare but often deadly disease, officials said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was ""acting with determination to rapidly halt the spread of the virus and protect communities"".
Four health workers were among the 15 people who had died, it said.
""Case numbers are likely to increase as the transmission is ongoing. Response teams and local teams will work to find the people who may be infected and need to receive care, to ensure everyone is protected as quickly as possible,""WHO added in a statement.
DR Congo had a ""stockpile of treatments"", including 2,000 doses of the Ervebo vaccine, ""effective to protect against this type of Ebola"", the global health body said.
The last Ebola outbreak in DR Congo was three years ago, killing six people.
An outbreak in 2018-20 was far deadlier, claiming more than 2,000 lives.
The virus, which is thought to have originated in fruit bats, was first detected in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now DR Congo.
People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola.

A judge inLouisianahas ordered the return of electronics belonging to an ex-Roman Catholic priest who pleaded guilty to obscenity for being caught having sex with two dominatrices atop a church altar while still belonging to the clergy in 2020.
However, the judge also told authorities to erase all data from the devices and storage media as a precaution against videos taken of the tryst from becoming public.
The ruling from state court judge Ellen Creel came in the case centering on Travis Clark as well as dominatrices whose professional names are Lady Vi (also known as Satanatrix) and Empress Ming. The videos in question have been under indefinite court seal ever since the trio’s encounter made international news headlines in 2020.
Clark’s attorneys, Marc Hoerner and Michael Kennedy, said that Creel on 4 August signed an order authorizing law enforcement officials to return cellphones, tablets, computers, gaming consoles, flash drives and memory cards they had seized from Clark while he was under investigation.
Even though Hoerner said that he does not believe any of the sealed videos are on Clark’s electronics, the former clergyman was still awaiting his property’s return on Friday while officials wiped them clean of all data.
Hoerner added that he does not believe the dominatrices – who ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanors – have ever sought the return of electronics seized from them during the case. Yet, if they ever did get them back, officials would wipe those electronics of all data, too, Hoerner said.
Kennedy and Hoerner declined further comment. But the Guardian has learned from multiple sources with knowledge of the case that – among other things – the videos depicted a communion wine chalice being urinated in.
The videos also depict Clark wearing a style of underwear typically worn by women as well as engaging in a sex act in a dormitory on the grounds of the church where he once served as pastor in Pearl River, Louisiana, about 40 miles (64km) north ofNew Orleans, the numerous sources said.
Clark, Lady Vi and Empress Ming all fell under authorities’ scrutiny after a passerby peering through a window saw the three evidently filming themselves having sex on the sanctuary altar at Sts Peter and Paul church on 30 September 2020.
Police responded to the church after they were called by the passerby, who took a cellphone video of what he could see. Besidearrestingthe group, officers confiscated stage lights, recording devices and sex toys.
New Orleans archbishop Gregory Aymond – whose archdiocese had filed for federal bankruptcy protection months earlier amid the fallout of a decades-old clergy child molestation scandal – had the altar burned and consecrated a replacement.
Hoerner has previously maintained that Clark’s actions may have offended Catholics but were legal, consensual acts among adults. Nonetheless, Hoener has said, for his client to move on with his life, Clark pleaded guilty to obscenity in 2022.
The women, who traveled to Pearl River,Louisiana, from out of state, pleaded guilty that same year to institutional vandalism, and like Clark they were sentenced to probation.
Clark ended up serving some jail time after he was found to have violated his probation terms by giving an interview to New Orleans’sNBC affiliatein which he explained the episode from his perspective.
He told the NBC station, WDSU, that the celibate life Catholic priests promise to lead along with the social-distancing practices implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic at the time left him facing “issues of loneliness and wanting human interaction”.
“Struggling and falling, sinning, too – priests sin as well,” said Clark, who voluntarily left the priesthood. He went on to say that he still believes in God and continued considering “mercy and forgiveness very important”.
Lady Vi gave an interview in October’s issue of Hustler magazine in which she said she had been “invited to film porn”, and the shoot location was at the church.
“Unfortunately, trespassers filmed us without our consent,” Lady Vi told the publication. She referred to the group’s subsequent prosecution, criticized the media’s coverage of the case, alluded to remarks from Aymond that the altar sex was “demonic” and asserted: “What matters is that we were consenting adults filming porn in a private location.
“But because we were in the [southern US region known as the] Bible Belt and the building had mythical significance, it was deemed a crime.”"

AMinnesotaman wrongly convicted of murder who spent nearly three decades in prison after being falsely implicated by a woman who has since confessed to the crime has been released.
State district court judge Marta Chou had vacated Bryan Hooper Sr’s first-degree murder conviction the day before. He was released on Thursday morning from Stillwater correctional facility, a Great North Innocence Project spokesperson said.
“Today, the courts have affirmed what Bryan Hooper, his family, his loved ones, and his advocates have always known: Mr Hooper is an innocent man,” Hennepin county attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement. “It is our duty as prosecutors to hold the correct individuals responsible for their actions, and that duty demands that we acknowledge our mistakes and make things right as quickly as we can.”
Hooper reunited with his children and planned to enjoy a meal with them and spend time with family, Project spokesperson Hayley Poxleitner said. He also plans to make his home for now in the Twin Cities area, where his children live.
In 1998, a jury convicted Hooper of premeditated murder, felony murder while committing burglary, and felony murder while committing kidnapping in connection with the death of 77-year-old Ann Prazniak. His conviction hinged largely on testimony from a woman whom authorities say has since confessed to the crime.
Police found Prazniak’s body in April 1998 in a cardboard box wrapped with Christmas lights in a closet in her Minneapolis apartment. Her cause of death was ruled asphyxiation, and she had died two weeks to a month before police found her body, according to court documents.
Hooper received three life sentences with the possibility of release after 30 years. In 2020, a judge granted his request to vacate two of three first-degree murder charges after he argued he had been wrongly convicted and sentenced for three counts of first-degree murder against the same person.
Last month, Moriarty announced her office’s support of Hooper’s release, saying a crucial trial witness had recanted her testimony amid the office’s review of the case and confessed to killing Prazniak and hiding her body. Jailhouse informants who had implicated Hooper also had recanted their testimony long ago, Moriarty has said.
Moriarty’s office and the Great North Innocence Project asked the court to vacate Hooper’s conviction.
The judge wrote: “The court finds that Mr Hooper’s conviction was tainted by false evidence and that without this false testimony, the jury might have reached a different conclusion.”
With Hooper cleared and freed, the Prazniak case will go back to the Minneapolis police department for any additional investigation, said Shawn Daye, the Hennepin county attorney’s office chief of staff.
The woman whom officials said confessed to the killing is in prison in Georgia for an assault-related crime and will be released in about four years."

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A shooter opened fire with a rifle Wednesday through the windows of a Catholic church in Minneapolis and struck some of the nearly 200 children celebrating Mass during the first week of school, killing two and wounding 17 people in anact of violencethe police chief called “absolutely incomprehensible.”
Armed with a rifle, shotgun and pistol, 23-year-old Robin Westman approached the side of the church and shot dozens of rounds through the windows toward the children sitting in the pews during Mass at the Annunciation Catholic School just before 8:30 a.m., Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at news conferences. He said the shooter then died by suicide.
The children who died were 8 and 10. Fourteen other kids and three octogenarian parishioners were wounded but expected to survive, the chief said.
On Wednesday evening, hundreds prayed, wiped away tears and held each other during a packed vigil at a nearby school’s gym where Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, along with Catholic clergy, joined the mourners.
Archbishop Bernard Hebda talked about the inscription at the front of the Annunciation Church that reads: “House of God and the gate of heaven.”
Minneapolis police say a shooting at a Catholic school has left three dead, including the shooter, and 17 injured. It happened Wednedsay morning at the Annunciation Catholic School.
“How is it that such a terrible tragedy could take place in a place that’s the house of God and the gate of heaven?” he asked. “It’s unthinkable.”
Fifth-grader Weston Halsne told reporters he ducked for the pews, covering his head, shielded by a friend who was lying on top of him. His friend was hit, he said.
“I was super scared for him, but I think now he’s okay,” the 10-year-old said, adding that he was praying for the other hospitalized children and adults.

Halsne’s grandfather, Michael Simpson, said the violence during Mass on the third day of school left him wondering whether God was watching over.
“I don’t know where He is,” Simpson said.
FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that the shooting is being investigated as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics.
O’Hara said police hadn’t yet found any relationship between the shooter and the church, nor determined a motive for the bloodshed. The chief said, however, that investigators were examining a social media post that appeared to show the shooter at the scene.
“The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” said O’Hara, who gave the wounded youngsters’ ages as 6 to 15. He said a wooden plank was placed to barricade some of the side doors, and that authorities found a smoke bomb at the scene.
On a YouTube channel titled Robin W, the alleged shooter released at least two videos before the channel was taken down by site administrators Wednesday.

In one, the alleged shooter shows a cache of weapons and ammunition, some with such phrases as “kill Donald Trump” and “Where is your God?” written on them.
A second video shows the alleged shooter pointing to two outside windows in what appears to be a drawing of the church, and then stabbing it with a long knife. It was unclear when that video was uploaded to the channel.
Westman’s uncle, former Kentucky state lawmaker Bob Heleringer, said he did not know the accused shooter well and was confounded by the “unspeakable tragedy.”
The police chief said Westman did not have an extensive known criminal history and is believed to have acted alone.
Federal officials referred to Westman as transgender, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey decried hatred being directed at “our transgender community.” Westman’s gender identity wasn’t clear. In 2020, a judge approved a petition, signed by Westman’s mother, asking for a name change from Robert to Robin, saying the petitioner “identifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.”
Bill Bienemann, who lives a couple of blocks away and has long attended Mass at Annunciation Church, said he heard as many as 50 shots over as long as four minutes.
“I was shocked. I said, ‘There’s no way that could be gunfire,’” he said.

The police chief said officers immediately responded to reports of the shooting, entered the church, rendered first aid and rescued some of the children hiding throughout the building.
Frey and Annunciation’s principal said teachers and children, too, responded heroically.
“Children were ducked down. Adults were protecting children. Older children were protecting younger children,” said the principal, Matt DeBoer.
Danielle Gunter, the mother of an eighth-grade boy who was shot, in a statement said her son told her a Minneapolis police officer “really helped him” by giving aid and a hug before her son got into an ambulance.
Amid a heavy uniformed law enforcement presence later Wednesday morning, children in dark green uniforms trickled out of the school with adults, giving lingering hugs and wiping away tears.
Vincent Francoual said his 11-year-old daughter, Chloe, survived the shooting by running downstairs to hide in a room with a table pressed against the door. But he still isn’t sure exactly how she escaped because she is struggling to communicate clearly about the traumatizing scene.
“She told us today that she thought she was going to die,” he said.
Gov. Walz lamented that children just starting the school year “were met with evil and horror and death.” He and President Donald Trump ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff on state and federal buildings, respectively, and the White House said the two men spoke. The governor was the Democratic vice presidential nominee in last year’s election against Trump’s running mate, now Vice President JD Vance, a Republican.

From the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV sent a telegram of condolences. The Chicago-born Leo, history’s first American pope, said he was praying for relatives of the dead.
News of the shooting rippled through a national Democratic officials’ meeting nearby in Minneapolis. U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Democrat who represents the area around the school, visited the scene.
Atlanta Archbishop Gregory Hartmeyer, who chairs the board of the National Catholic Education Association, said in a statement that reasonable firearms legislation must be passed.
“The murder of children worshipping at Mass is unspeakable,” Hartmeyer said. “We must take action to protect all children and families from violence.”
Monday had been the first day of the school year at Annunciation, a 102-year-old school in a leafy residential and commercial neighborhood about 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of downtown Minneapolis.
Karin Cebulla, who said she had worked as a learning specialist at Annuciation and sent her two now-college-aged daughters there, described the school as an accepting, caring community.
“Everyone felt safe here, and I just pray that it continues to be a place where people feel safe,” she said.
The gunfire was the latest in a series of fatal shootings in Minnesota’s most populous city in less than 24 hours. One person was killed and six others were hurt in a shooting Tuesday afternoon. Hours later, two people died in two other shootings in the city.
O’Hara, the police chief, said the Annunciation shooting does not appear to be related to other recent violence.
Alongside many major U.S. cities, violent crime in Minneapolis has decreased since the COVID-19 pandemic, based on data from AH Datalytics and its Real-Time Crime Index, which tracks crimes across the country using law enforcement data.

Minutes before Nepalese Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigned from his office, Gen Z protesters broke into Parliament and set fire to one of the buildings on the premises.
Demonstrators also set fire to Oli's residence in Bhaktapur's Balkot area and other senior leaders amid the ongoing protests triggered by a since-revoked social media ban.Follow Nepal protests live updates
Visuals showed thousands of protesters storming the Parliament as plumes of grey and black smoke arose in the area.
Even as the building was on fire, thousands of protesters continued to march towards the Parliament, shouting slogans and raising flags in the area, visuals showed.
The demonstrators also entered the Singha Durbar premises, breaking into the area through its western gate. They also reportedly set the gate on fire while forcing their way into the central administrative complex of Nepal.
The Gen Z protesters shouted slogans like ""KP Chor, Desh Chhod"", ""Take Action Against Corrupt Leaders"" across Nepal's capital city of Kathmandu.
The residence of former home minister Ramesh Lekhak at Naikap was also torched just a day after he resigned from the post following the police's use of force on the young protesters agitating against the ban on 26 social media sites, including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and YouTube.
The protests have so far left 19 people dead and more than 300 others injured.
Meanwhile, officials said thatOli resigned from the PM's postamid mounting pressure in the anti-government protests. His resignation came shortly after hundreds of demonstrators entered his office shouting anti-government slogans.
As protesters moved to vandalise private residences and government buildings, all flights at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) have been cancelled for the day over security concerns, The Kathmandu Post reported. Hansa Raj Pandey, general manager at TIA, however, asserted that the ""airport is not closed"".
Widespread protests led by youths under the banner of Gen Z broke out in Nepal as the KP Sharma Oli-led government banned WhatsApp, Facebook, X, YouTube and 22 other social media sites in the country.
As the protests grew violent, resulting in the deaths of 19 people, the government late on Monday revoked the ban. However, anti-government protests continued over the lives lost in the agitation across the country. Authorities already reportedly imposed curfew in the key areas of the capital after the deaths in Monday's protest.
Additionally, the central office of the Nepali Congress in Sanepa was also vandalised on Tuesday afternoon.
With the violent protest escalating, theIndia-Nepal borderat Panitanki in West Bengal's Darjeeling has been put on alert. Superintendent of Police (SP) Praveen Parkash said the police patrolling in the border has been intensified.
""A police post has been set up here at the round-up with deployment of force. We are in alert mode and monitoring the situation with the help of security agencies and the Nepal police. There's no information about anyone being stuck. The police have heightened patrolling at the border area,"" the SP told news agency ANI."

Every two-and-a-half years, Uche and her husband pay more than a combined £5,000 forNHScare, on top of the tax and national insurance deducted from their salaries as a care worker and an IT worker.
Now, thousands more skilled workers face having to “pay twice” for services for 10 years or more, campaigners fear, as the government considers extending the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) – and eventually citizenship – in an immigration crackdown.
Currently, the standard wait for settlement is five years, during which time immigrants typically pay the equivalent of £1,035 a year for NHS care, on top of taxes deducted, as well as thousands more in varying visa costs.
In May, making his nowinfamous “island of strangers” speech, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, launched theimmigration white paper, including proposals to extend the standard qualifying period for settlement to 10 years, proposals inherited by the new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood.
On Monday, MPs said constituents who thought they were close to qualifying were suffering huge anxiety, and that the plans would harm the economy and worsen skills shortages and exploitation. They were speaking at a Westminster Hall debate triggered by two e-petitions, one opposing proposals to extend the skilled worker visa pathway from five years and another calling for Hongkongers to be exempted, signed by more than 165,000 people and 108,000 people respectively.
Uche, a 49-year-old mother of four from south London who asked not be named for her safety, opposes longer waits being extended to others.
She is three-quarters into a “family life 10-year-route” to settlement which allows individuals to remain in the UK, with leave granted in 30‑month periods and eligibility for settlement after a decade of continuous residence. Indian, Nigerian and Pakistani nationals are thethree largest nationality groups on this pathway, totalling 44%. There is a further ILR fee of £3,029 each when the 10 years is up, and they are at risk of remaining “in limbo” if they cannot pay.
Uche and her husband estimate they have spent about £8,000 in visa fees and £15,000 in NHS surcharges since he graduated from the University of Staffordshire IT course that brought them to the UK from Nigeria in 2011.
She said: “Financially we are being tortured. I start at 5am and come home at 9pm – I have to take all the hours I can get to keep paying for visas and healthcare. It’s really affecting our relationship with my four children who were all born here.
“My ambition is to be a midwife but there is no time or money. My husband could earn twice as much, but can’t get those roles because he only has further leave to remain.
“People say migrants take but we have no recourse to public funds. We are paying for things twice.”
Raising the issue at Monday’s parliamentary debate, the Labour MP for South Norfolk, Ben Goldsborough, said immigration discourse had been “fuelled by the algorithms of X and Facebook” and those “who peddle the idea that you can have … lower migration but without consequences to our economy, our NHS, our diplomacy, or our culture”.
The Lib Dem Tim Farron said a lack of clarity around the plans was “cruel” to people who “thought they were on one path and now are not, but also counterproductive, because we may end up losing really talented people”.
The Welsh Labour MP Steve Witherden said the proposals would have “devastating consequences … doubling the qualifying period doubles already extortionate costs”. But the Conservative MP Katie Lam said the government should go further, revoking existing ILR status from “those who’ve committed a crime, accessed state support or are unlikely to contribute more than they cost”.
The Home Office says “settlement in the UK is a privilege, not a right”, that reform will involve extending the qualifying period, with reductions through points earned from demonstrating “long-term contribution”. “Existing safeguards to protect the vulnerable” would be retained. The Home Office minister Alex Norris said the government would be “moving forward” with a consultation, but did not provide a timeframe to the debate.
In a joint statement, campaigners from Reunite Families UK, Migrant Voice, Ramfel and Praxis said the Labour government was repeating “all the same political choices” it had criticised Conservatives for.
They added: “The race to the bottom on migration policy has to stop. No one will benefit from the increasingly harsh rhetoric and migration policies adopted by this government … who, we are afraid, are just preparing the political and public arena for the far right.”"

PresidentDonald Trumpsaid it ""looks like we've lost India and Russia to deepest, darkest, China"" in a new post on his Truth Social platform.
""May they have a long and prosperous future together!""Trump wrote early on Friday morning, September 5, sharing an image of the leaders of the three countries together.
Chinese PresidentXi Jinpingwelcomed Russian PresidentVladimir Putinand Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modito the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin earlier in the week.
The SCO began as a security forum to counter U.S. influence in Central Asia but has grown in importance over the years.
The three leaders spoke warmly of relations between their countries, all of which are at odds with the U.S. on issues primarily centred on the Russian war against Ukraine and trade.
Modi has also bristled at Trump's claims to have brought about a ceasefire in the recent conflict between India and Pakistan.
The Trump administration has imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on India related to its purchases of Russian oil amid the war in Ukraine. It had already put a 25 percent tariff on India over trade barriers faced by American firms.
Earlier this week, Trump accused Russia, China, and North Korea ofconspiring against the U.S.when Xi, Putin, andKim Jong Unmet at a military parade in Beijing to mark 80 years since the end of World War II.
Trumpsaid in his Truth Social post on Wednesday, before the parade:""The big question to be answered is whether or not President Xi of China will mention the massive amount of support and 'blood' that The United States of America gave to China in order to help it to secure its FREEDOM from a very unfriendly foreign invader. Many Americans died in China's quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice!
""May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.""
China rejected Trump's assertion that there was a conspiracy against the U.S.at the military parade.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said:""The purpose was to join peace-loving countries and peoples in remembering history, honoring those who sacrificed their lives, cherishing peace and looking to the future.""
Yuri Ushakov, an aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said thatTrump may have been being ironicwhen he saidPutin Xi and Kimwere plotting against America.
""I want to say that no one was plotting [against the U.S.], no one was weaving anything, no conspiracies. Moreover, no one even had this in mind, none of these three leaders [of the Russian Federation, China and the DPRK] had it,"" Ushakov said, according to the Russian state news agency Tass.
""In addition, I can say that everyone understands the role that the United States, the current administration of President Trump, and President Trump personally play in the current international situation.""

""As of today, we are using our domestically produced long-range weapons. And to be honest, we haven't been discussing such matters with the US lately,"" Zelenskyy said at a joint press conference withCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.
""There was a time when there were different signals regarding our retaliatory strikes after their attacks on our energy system,"" Zelenskyy said, referring to Russia's strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure. ""That was already a very long time ago. Today, we don't even mention it.""
The Ukrainian leader's statement signals a massive change in what had, for years, been a status quo inKyiv's deep strike capability. Ukraine, reliant for much of the war on long-range Western systems such as theUS-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, typically needed approval from Washington and its allies for strikes into Russia.
The ATACMS in particular requires US-provided satellite data and targeting for successful precision strikes, affording the Pentagon greater authority over what the weapons can be used for.
NATO countries, fearing escalation with Moscow, withheld permission for Kyiv to launch attacks into Russia for months, limiting strikes to targets in Ukrainian territory.
Ukrainian officials repeatedly voiced frustration at the restriction, saying they were kneecapped and unable to strike the Kremlin's forces massing on the border.
In November, after an extended period of indecision, the Biden administration and US allies began permitting selected attacks on Russian soil with munitions such as ATACMS andStorm Shadow missiles.
But that arrangement may be in question. The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday, citing two unnamed US officials, that the Pentagon had blocked Ukraine from firing its ATACMS into Russia and had denied at least one request.
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said to WSJ that there had been ""no change in military posture in Russia-Ukraine at this time.""
The report comes as the Trump administration has tried to entice Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, hoping to mediate a peace deal.
President Donald Trump also raised the topic in a ThursdayTruthSocial postwhile criticizing his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.
""It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader's country. It's like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia,"" Trump wrote.
Notably, he toldTime Magazine in Decemberthat he had disagreed ""very vehemently"" with Ukraine's ATACMS strikes on Russia the month before.
But Ukraine has, in the last few years, developed its own long-range missiles and systems, which would allow Kyiv more leeway to independently launch precision strikes on Russian targets.
One example isthe Neptune, a truck-launched subsonic cruise missile meant to hit naval targets.
The Neptune was in development before the full-scale invasion, but Ukraine has more recently unveiled a new ground-launched munition.
On August 18, its defense minister said the country was now serially producing theFlamingo, a domestically manufactured missiletouted to have a range of 1,800 miles.
That distance would allow Ukraine to possibly threaten Russia's key military production facilities in faraway areas such as the Urals.
Zelenskyy said on Friday that the Flamingo could enter mass production by February.
""The missile has undergone successful tests. It is currently our most successful missile,"" he told reporters.
These precision munitions aside, Ukraine has also been regularly launching deep strikes against Russian energy facilities and weapons production plants withfixed-wing drones,which are far slower.

Two armed Venezuelan F-16 fighter jets flew over the USS Jason Dunham on Thursday, according to multiple Defense Department officials who described the action as a ""show of force.""
The Dunham, an Aegis guided-missile destroyer, is among a flotilla of U.S. warshipsdispatched to the regionin recent weeksthat the Pentagon says have been deployed to target criminal organizations and narco-terrorism.
CBS News was unable to determine what actions the USS Jason Dunham took, if any, in response to the flyover.
Following the publication of CBS News' story, the Defense Departmentconfirmed in a statementon X that two Venezuelan aircraft ""flew near a U.S. Navy vessel in international waters.""
""This highly provocative move was designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations,"" the statement reads. ""The cartel running Venezuela is strongly advised not to pursue any further effort to obstruct, deter or interfere with counter-narcotics and counter-terror operations carried out by the US military.""
The U.S. Navy vessels were sent to the waters off Venezuela as President Trump vows to crack down on drug cartels — and as tensions rise between Mr. Trump and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
The Trump administration has accused Maduro of allying with drug cartels to traffic narcotics to the United States, recentlydoublinga reward it is offering for Maduro's arrest to $50 million. The Venezuelan government has denied the allegations, and Madurocalled the warshipsa ""criminal and bloody threat"" earlier this week,deploying drones and warshipsto patrol the coastline.
On Tuesday, the U.S. military said itstruck a boatthat it alleged was carrying drugs from Venezuela, and claimed it had killed 11 people on board who it accused of belonging to theVenezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, according to Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

reddit,r/worldnews/,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/08/boris-johnson-nicolas-maduro-meeting-invoice,t3_1nc5siy,"Boris Johnson was paid £240,000 after Maduro meeting, invoice shows",nolesfan2011,2025-09-09 01:20:17,415,19,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Johnson’s office sent invoice to hedge fund manager, which was paid, weeks after meeting Venezuelan leader last year
Revealed: how Boris Johnson traded PM contacts for global business deals
From a private jet somewhere over the Caribbean Sea in February last year,Boris Johnsoncalled his old political adversary David Cameron, then the foreign secretary, to notify him of a visit.
Johnson had taken a day out from a family holiday in the Dominican Republic for an unlikely meeting with the leftwing president of Venezuela,Nicolás Maduro, a man whom Johnson, when in office, had likened to a “dictator of an evil regime”.
The other participant in the meeting was less well known: Maarten Petermann, a hedge fund manager.
When later questioned about the meeting, Johnson told UK government officials: “It is not true to say that I was paid for any meetings inVenezuela.” The former prime minister said he had no contractual relationship with the hedge fund Merlyn Advisors.
Johnson later suggested he had been acting as a diplomatic backchannel, but weeks after attending the 45-minute meeting, the Guardian can reveal, Johnson received £240,000 from Petermann.
The revelation is contained in the Boris Files, aleak of datafrom the office of Boris Johnson, his private office, which receives a taxpayer-funded allowance. The files contain a contract with Merlyn Advisors signed by Johnson months earlier in September 2023.
The contract, drawn up by Merlyn, notes that Johnson “over a long career has acquired a unique experience and knowledge of domestic UK government politics and international relations”.
It says Merlyn Advisors “interacts with a number of different domestic and international stakeholders which would benefit from the perspectives and the experiences of” Johnson. For each meeting, Johnson was to be paid a fee of £200,000 – worth up to £1.6m a year for eight meetings.
The contract was to last two years from October 2023. The company would also pay £35,000 a month to support a thinktank that Johnson was considering setting up in the UK.
Petermann said: “I have no comment. Please don’t try to put words in my mouth as to whether or not I dispute it.”
The Guardian has not confirmed whether the payment made to Johnson was for his visit to Venezuela.
Johnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. After publication, he emailed a statement to the Guardian that did not respond directly to questions relating to his meeting with Maduro.
The statement denied that hisprivate office misuseda subsidy scheme intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties. The public duty costs allowance (PDCA) should not be used for private or commercial purposes.
“This story is rubbish,” he said. “The PDCA has been used entirely in accordance with the rules. The Guardian should change its name to Pravda.”
The cache does not include a copy of the contract also signed by the company and it is possible it was abandoned after UK officials asked questions about the arrangement.
However, a log of payments suggests that an invoice, which mirrors the contract, was sent by Johnson’s office to Petermann weeks after the meeting with Maduro, an authoritarian president whose government isunder investigationby international criminal court prosecutors for alleged crimes against humanity.
The invoice, for £200,000 plus an additional £40,000, was sent on 15 March 2024, weeks after the meeting with Maduro. This invoice was paid on 7 May, the document suggests. There are no details of other invoices to Merlyn.
The files were obtained byDistributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. The Guardian is the first media outlet to publish stories based on the leak.
Johnson has said he was “extensively briefed” by the top UK diplomat in Caracas before the meeting and updated the embassy afterwards.
However, the £240,000 payment raises questions about the true nature of the trip and Johnson’s claims to have acted as a diplomatic backchannel for the UK to open a dialogue with Maduro.
The Sunday Timeshas reported that Johnson did not tell Cameron about Petermann’s involvement in the meeting.
Cameron, who was embroiled in his own post-Downing Street scandal, might have warned Johnson of the perils of using the privileges of his role as a former PM for financial gain. As prime minister, Johnson had launched an official investigation into Cameron’s lobbying for Greensill Capital.
Johnson faced questions from UK government officials about the Venezuela meeting after a series of reports in early March last year from the Sunday Times and the Financial Times revealing Petermann’s involvement and Johnson’s relationship with the company. But details of the contract and an invoice sent to the company have not previously been reported.
The media reports drew the attention of officials at the Whitehall revolving-door watchdog responsible for monitoring the post-government careers of ex-ministers, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).
They wrote to Johnson on 18 March 2024. What seemed confusing to the officials was that Johnson had made an application months earlier, in September 2023. What they had not known – and what is revealed in the leaked files – is that the contract prepared by the hedge fund had been signed by Johnson.
At the time, Johnson faced a potential difficulty: he had told Acoba that “no publicity or announcement whatsoever is planned in relation to this role”, but if approval was given by Acoba, his work for the hedge fund would be revealed to the public in a letter published by the watchdog.
Johnson now faces fresh questions about his candour with the watchdog. He told Acoba he had had no meetings with the hedge fund in his last two years in office.
In fact, Johnson had a meeting with Petermann when he was still in office, just over a week before the end of his time as prime minister, leaked documents show.
The leaked files reveal they met for a two-and-a-half-hour lunch at Chequers, Johnson’s grace-and-favour country house, on 28 August 2022. Petermann attended alongside a fellow trustee at an animal conservation charity that had hired Johnson’s soon-to-be wife, Carrie, more than a year earlier in January 2021.
The lunch with Petermann has not been previously reported and was never disclosed in official transparency registers. The secret lunch raises questions over whether Johnson used his final days as prime minister, and the luxuries of that office, to develop a relationship with a future business interest.
Fourteen months after the Chequers lunch, Johnson told Acoba officials in October 2023 that he had decided not to take up a role with the hedge fund. This came only days after he had signed the contract prepared by Merlyn Advisors. One possibility is that the contract was shelved at the 11th hour after Acoba’s inquiries.
For a fortnight in late March 2024, Acoba repeatedly sought clarification from Johnson about his role with the company. He repeatedly denied having a contractual relationship with the company or having been paid for any meetings in Venezuela. He refused to say in what capacity he had met Maduro, or to characterise his relationship with the company.
The then chair of Acoba, the Conservative peer Eric Pickles, would later characterise Johnson’s responses as “evasive” and lacking candour. Lord Pickles concluded there remained “a reasonable concern” Johnson was acting for the company in “a capacity that would be considered advisory work” and had breached the rules by failing to properly answer Acoba’s questions.
Just over a fortnight later, the £240,000 invoice would be marked by Johnson’s staff as paid.

‘India and US are close friends’: PM Modi responds to Trump’s post as 100% tariff threat looms
New revelations about aJune 11 phone callbetween Prime MinisterNarendra Modiand U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpshed light on why India–U.S. ties have plunged to a new low.
According to a report in The New York Times, the turning point came during a June 17 phone call when Trump reportedly once again told Modi that he had ‘solved’ the military conflict between India and Pakistan. He reportedly suggested that Pakistan would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize and implied India should do the same.
The report claims Modi rejected this assertion, making clear that the ceasefire had been arranged directly between India and Pakistan, without U.S. involvement. The exchange reportedly left Modi visibly frustrated. Despite his pushback, Trump repeated his claims publicly, further aggravating New Delhi. The two leaders have not spoken since that call.

The New York Times report comes days after Bloomberg reported similar information from the 35-minute phone call between the two leaders. According to anonymous New Delhi officials quoted in the report, Modi had bluntly called out Trump’s farce over his claims of ensuring a truce between Pakistan and India amid operation Sindoor. “India does not and will never accept mediation,” Modi was quoted as saying in the report.
This phone call was made soon after Trump had invited Modi to the White House in an attempt to ambush him into a photo op with Pakistani Army ChiefAsim Munir, an invitation the Indian Prime Minister turned down. And later went public with his decision – citing prior commitments to visit Croatia instead.
Officials cited in the report claimed, India saw Trump’s hosting of Munir as giving legitimacy to the terror activities he had been accused of.
Weeks after the call, Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Indian imports, later raising it to 50 per cent in retaliation for India’s purchase of Russian oil. The steep tariffs have hit India harder than most other countries.

Strained ties have extended beyond trade and ceasefire claims. Trump’s administration has taken steps that affected India directly, including deportations of undocumented Indian immigrants, restrictions on student visas, and heightened scrutiny of H-1B visa holders. These moves added further pressure on New Delhi.
Amid the tensions, Modi has landed in China to meet President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin, signalling a possible shift in India’s diplomatic shift towards the east."
reddit,r/worldnews/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp98n1eg443o,t3_1nc6anm,Nepal lifts social media ban after 19 killed in protests,Just-Sale-7015,2025-09-09 01:43:59,284,22,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Nepal has lifted a social media ban after it sparked anti-corruption protests that led to clashes with police, leaving at least 19 people dead.
In the weeks before the ban, a ""nepo kid"" campaign, spotlighting the lavish lifestyles of politicians' children and allegations of corruption, had taken off on social media.
When the government moved to ban 26 social media platforms, including Facebook and YouTube, protests erupted with thousands of young people storming parliament in the capital Kathmandu on Monday. Several districts are now under a curfew.
A government minister said they lifted the ban after an emergency meeting late on Monday night to ""address the demands of Gen Z"".
Last week, Nepal's government ordered authorities to block 26 social media platforms for not complying with a deadline to register with Nepal's ministry of communication and information technology.
Platforms such as Instagram and Facebook have millions of users in Nepal, who rely on them for entertainment, news and business.
But the government had justified its ban, implemented last week, in the name of tackling fake news, hate speech and online fraud.
Young people who took to the streets on Monday said they were also protesting against what they saw as the authoritarian attitude of the government. Many held placards with slogans including ""enough is enough"" and ""end to corruption"".
Some protesters hurled stones at Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's house in his hometown Damak.
One protester, Sabana Budathoki had earlier told the BBC that the social media ban was ""just the reason"" they gathered.
""Rather than [the] social media ban, I think everyone's focus is on corruption,"" she explained, adding: ""We want our country back. We came to stop corruption.""
On Monday, police in Kathmandu had fired water cannons, batons and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters.
Prime Minister Oli said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the violence and casualty toll, and blamed the day's events on ""infiltration by various vested interest groups"".
The government would set up a panel to investigate the protests, he said, adding that it would also offer financial ""relief"" to the families of those who died and free treatment to those injured.
Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak submitted his resignation on Monday evening following intense criticism over his administration's use of force during the protests.

September 8, 2025 / 12:09 PM EDT/ CBS News
Johannesburg —The Minister of Health for the Democratic Republic of Congo, Samuel Roger Kamba, confirmed last week an outbreak of the highly infectious Zaire strain of Ebola virus disease in the country's Central Kasai Province. He said 16 deaths and 28 suspected cases had been confirmed, including four suspected infections among health care workers.
World Health Organization regional director for Africa Mohamed Janabi said the first case, known as the index case, was a ""34-year-old pregnant woman who was admitted on August 20 and passed away on August 25 with typical features for hemorrhagic fever; bloody diarrhea, bleeding from the nose, vomiting, and bleeding from the rectum.""
The Ebola virus is transmitted to humans through close contact with infected wildlife, often bats, and can then spread through bodily fluids through close human-to-human contact. The WHOsaid that, as of Sept. 4, the case fatality rate in the Congo outbreak was 57%, with 80% of the cases in people aged 15 or older.
This is the sixth Ebola outbreak within seven years in Congo, making it the highest concentration of outbreaks since the virus was first discovered in 1976.
A team of first responders arrived Sunday in the Bulape health zone, where the outbreak has struck, with medical supplies.
In the country's capital Kinshasa, health workers and first responders from the Ministry of Health, the WHO and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were given vaccinations ahead of deployments to the affected region.
Congo currently has a stockpile of 2,000 vaccine doses and has ordered more to arrive in the coming days,according to the WHO.
Patrick Otim, the WHO's emergency response coordinator for the area, told reporters during a Sept. 4 briefing that the United Nations agency was already working to trace close contacts with known cases, increase field lab testing capacity and community response to ensure early reporting.
He acknowledged that the DRC had requested additional vaccines and stressed that, as ""early supportive care is key to lifesaving,"" the WHO was working to deliver more medical supplies, including protective clothing and other items ""necessary to manage the outbreak.""
The last two outbreaks, in 2022, were contained quickly, said Otim, but he noted that they were addressed before the Trump administration severely cut funding for international health programs, including the WHO.
Those cuts havefueled concern in Africa and elsewhereabout the ability of individual nations and global agencies to respond to and quickly contain outbreaks of diseases including Ebola — and to keep such deadly viruses from reaching U.S. shores.
""The recent cuts will definitely have an impact,"" Otim said at the briefing. ""As a global community, we need to work together to stop this virus, as diseases do not respect borders.""
""What we know (from past outbreaks) is you need to get supplies and resources as soon as possible to stop transmission,"" Otim added.
President Trumpannounced in Januarythat the U.S. — long a key stakeholder and largest donor to the agency — would be pulling out of the WHO, with the White House citing ""the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.""
The Trump administration, at the time, also accused the WHO of demanding ""unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.""
The WHO warned almost immediately that, given the uncertainty over future U.S. funding, itwas cutting back spendingin ways that could impact its operations.
Congo's health care system was already overburdened as itbattles to contain an mpox outbreak, with roughly 130,000 suspected cases since last year and about 2,000 deaths now recorded, the WHO said at the briefing last week.
Complicating the response is the fact that the nearest medical isolation unit to the outbreak only has 15 beds, and road access from Kinshasa can take up to three days, further delaying the arrival of medical teams and supplies.
The WHO has already delivered about 13 tons of emergency medical supplies to Congo to help contain and treat the outbreak.
Other African nations have put border entry points and health facilities on high alert to detect any possible Ebola cases.

Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine'senergy systemahead of the autumn-winter season, when energy demand rises due to lower temperature and shorter daylight time.
Zelensky said Ukraine's top priorities now include protecting critical infrastructure, particularly in the energy sector, as well as securing air defense systems and the missiles needed to operate them.

AFU General Staff reported on Sunday that Ukrainian forces carried out a coordinated series of overnight strikes on Russian fuel infrastructure, including the Druzhba pipeline.
A Ukrainian drone strike caused “comprehensive fire damage” to Russia’s Druzhba oil pipeline in the Bryansk region, the commander of Kyiv’s drone forces,Robert Brovdi, said Sunday.
AFU General Staffreported earlier that daythat Ukrainian forces carried out a coordinated series of overnight strikes on Russian fuel infrastructure and military sites, targeting key logistics points used to supply Moscow’s troops, including the Druzhba pipeline.
Follow our coverage of the war on the@Kyivpost_official.
The Druzhba pipeline supplies Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia, which still rely on Moscow’s crude despite most European Union states cutting energy ties after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Hungary’s MOL oil company said deliveries were running normally, while Slovak Economy Minister Denisa Sakova wrote on Facebook that supplies to Slovakia were unaffected.
Ukraine’s military said the pipeline strike was part of a wider overnight campaign against Russian energy infrastructure and logistics hubs.
Ukrainian forces also hit the Ilsky oil refinery in Krasnodar Krai, where drone debris sparked a fire that was quickly contained. In addition, strikes targeted Russian troop locations and supply depots in the Kursk region.
Kyiv says attacks on Russian fuel facilities are intended to undermine Moscow’s war effort and disrupt its supply chains. Ukraine has repeatedly targeted Druzhba in recent weeks, causing temporary disruptions to shipments.
“The Defense Forces continue measures to degrade Russia’s offensive potential and compel the Russian Federation to end its armed aggression against Ukraine,” Ukraine’s General Staff said.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sammy Kogan
OTTAWA - Prime Minister Mark Carney and his environment minister aren't saying whether Canada is still committed to meeting its climate goals under the Paris agreement by 2030, as the government faces criticism over his emissions reduction plans.
In an email to The Canadian Press on Monday, the office of Environment Minister Julie Dabrusin said Canada is committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 — but would not commit to the 2030 target when asked directly.
""Taking into account the evolving global and economic context, the federal government will provide an update on its emissions reductions plan as we strive towards our 2030 and 2035 targets,"" Dabrusin's press secretary Keean Nembhard wrote.
""Building climate resilience and meeting our targets is not optional. It’s economically smart, fiscally responsible, and essential to protecting Canadians and the places they call home.""
Canada has a legal requirement to achieve net-zero by 2050, having included the target in legislation in 2021. Part of its path to get there is a plan to cut emissions to at least 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 — a commitment set out in the Paris agreement.
The statement from Dabrusin's office was the third time on Monday of a member of Carney's government declined to commit to the Paris target.
Earlier Monday, Industry Minister Mélanie Joly also sidestepped a question about whether the government is committed to its 2030 target, deferring instead to Dabrusin for comment.
""We want to make sure we find ways to be net-zero by 2050,"" Joly said.
Carney, in St. John's on Monday to announce tariff relief measures for Atlantic Canada businesses, was asked by reporters how his government is planning to adjust its climate targets after recent policy announcements dialed back some of the Trudeau government's climate initiatives.
On his first day in office in March, Carney eliminated the consumer carbon price. On Friday, he delayed the electric vehicle sales mandate for at least a year. Carney has said he plans to strengthen the industrial carbon pricing system but has yet to explain how.
Carney did not directly answer the question about Canada's climate targets and instead pivoted to the competitive advantages of a low-carbon economy.
""We see becoming low-carbon in any industry as being a key driver of competitiveness,"" Carney said, adding he'd have more to share in the coming weeks.
""So that focus on what can we do in order to drive emissions down in a way that makes the country more competitive is crucial.""
He pointed to offshore oil and gas as a low-carbon alternative to conventional extraction and suggested his government's push to double housing construction over the next decade will lead to more energy efficient homes.
""And all of that will get our emissions down and make us more competitive. So that's the focus of the government,"" Carney said, without addressing how those lower emissions would compare to Canada's targets.
""The government is focused on results.""
While the government has yet to say whether it will miss its 2030 target — or whether it's still trying to achieve it — observers raised doubts about the target even before Carney dialed back carbon pricing and electric vehicle policies.
A report last year from the federal environment commissioner said Canada was not on track to meet its 2030 target. Jerry DeMarco estimated Canada's emissions had only dropped seven per cent below 2005 levels.
On Friday, after Carney delayed implementing the electric vehicle mandate by a year to give Canada's automakers some liquidity, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May questioned his climate intentions.
""Carney’s first hundred days show us clearly that he is rolling back climate action at every turn. Scrapping the carbon price, dismantling legislation, cancelling the EV mandate, these are not the decisions of a leader serious about the climate emergency,"" she said in a statement.

The president said he had explained when and how certain parts of Ukraine’s territory were occupied, including parts of the east and Crimea in 2014.
Zelenskyy did not directly comment on the US position, whether they would insist on a territorial exchange, or whether Ukraine has a formula determining the ""acceptability"" of recognising certain occupied territories as belonging to Russia.

The city represents a key Ukrainian forces transportation hub in Donbas, the loss of which could open the way for Russian troops to attack the remaining Ukrainian-held cities in the Donetsk region.
While peace talks drag on, Russian PresidentVladimir Putinis preparing a new offensive in eastern Ukraine, with European and Ukrainian officials warning that a breakthrough could come near Pokrovsk, a city Moscow has failed to capture for over a year.
Last week, German and French officials discussed the buildup of Russian forces near the city, people familiar with the talks toldBloomberg.
Follow our coverage of the war on the@Kyivpost_official.
On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia haddeployed 100,000 troopsto the area.
Pokrovskis a key transport hub for Ukrainian forces in Donbas. Its fall could open the way for Russian troops to attack the final major Ukrainian-held cities in the Donetsk region: Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.
The industrial eastern Ukrainian city has been the main declared objective for a bloody Russian offensive launched more than a year ago.
The Russian thrust towards Dobropillya was on a narrow front and, if consolidated, would make it even more difficult for Ukrainian forces to supply the Pokrovsk salient, reports said.
Russian forces reached within 8-10 kilometers of Pokrovsk in August and September 2024 but were unable to capture it and have attempted to encircle the city this year.
In mid-August, Russian troopsbriefly broke through north of Pokrovsk, advancing about 10 kilometers (6.25 miles) near Dobropillia before Ukrainian units pushed them back.
The summer offensive resulted in minimal gains, with Moscow capturing just 2,033 square kilometers (785 square miles), or 0.3% of Ukraine’s territory.
Speaking in Beijing on Wednesday after viewing a military parade with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, Putinsaidhe would continue fighting if a peace deal cannot be reached.
He praised Russian forces’ advances, claiming they were making progress “on all fronts” and had weakened Ukraine’s military.
If there was no peace deal, he said, “then we will have to resolve all our tasks militarily.”
Zelensky, whoarrived in Paristhe same day for talks with European allies, said he has seen no signs that Moscow is serious about ending the war.
With no signs of a Russian withdrawal, Ukraine and its allies are working to strengthen Kyiv’s army.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the effort “the most important security guarantee we can provide,” while European Commission President Ursula von der LeyensaidUkraine must become “a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders.”
European countries are funding purchases of US weapons, with Zelensky hoping for $1 billion in monthly acquisitions.
Last week, the USapproved the sale of 3,350 missileswith ranges up to 450 kilometers (280 miles), worth $825 million.
Ukraine is also developing new weapons at home, including theFlamingo cruise missile, capable of flying 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles), and using artificial intelligence to coordinate drone swarm attacks.

Following the House of Representatives, the Senate has also spoken out in favour of this.
On Tuesday, it approved an amendment to the Civil Code submitted by the government by 33 votes to four with seven abstentions. The House of Representatives had already approved it in May. The aim of the bill is to clarify that violence in parenting is not permitted and thus contribute to the prevention of violence.
+ Almost half of children in Switzerland experience domestic violence
The government bill provides for two new sentences in the Civil Code. The first enshrines the absence of violence in law. According to the second, the cantons must ensure that parents and children can turn to counselling centres together or individually in the event of difficulties in parenting.
One in five children in Switzerland regularly experiences psychological violence. This was revealed in a study presented by the organisation Child Protection Switzerland in November 2024.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland is closing its border with Belarus on Thursday at midnight local time as a result of Russia-led military exercises taking place in Belarus, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday, amid escalating tensions between Minsk and Warsaw.
Russia and Belarus' large-scale military exercises, known as the ""Zapad"" drills, have raised security concerns in neighbouring NATO member states Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. ""Zapad-2025"" (West-2025) will be held in western Russia and Belarus.
""On Friday, Russian-Belarusian manoeuvres, very aggressive from a military doctrine perspective, begin in Belarus, very close to the Polish border,"" Tusk told a government meeting.
""Therefore, for national security reasons, we will close the border with Belarus, including railway crossings, in connection with the Zapad manoeuvres on Thursday at midnight.""
Asked about the duration of the border closure, Interior Minister Marcin Kierwinski said it would only be reopened when the government was sure ""there was no more threat to Polish citizens"".
The Belarusian Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the Polish charge d'affaires to complain about the border closure which it said ""caused significant difficulties"". It described the measure as ""an abuse of its geographical position"".
""The temporary suspension of passage indicates rather an intention to conceal one's own actions than the existence of any threat from Belarus,"" it said.
Lithuania's border guard said on Tuesday the protection of its border with Belarus and Russia would be strengthened due to the exercises.
STRAINED RELATIONS
Already strained relations between Poland and Belarus have hit new lows since Minsk's ally Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Poland has already closed most of its border crossings with Belarus, with only two still operating.
On Thursday, Belarusian media reported that a Polish national had been arrested in Belarus on suspicion of espionage for having documents related to the Zapad exercises.
Tusk said on Tuesday that Poland arrested a Belarusian spy and would expel a diplomat who ""supported the aggressive action of the Belarusian state against Poland"". He added the arrest was the result of cooperation with the Czech Republic and Romania.
Prague said on Monday it would expel a Belarusian diplomat it accused of espionage, while in Romania, anti-organised crime prosecuting unit DIICOT said it was investigating a 47-year-old Moldovan former senior intelligence agency chief for treason.
The Belarusian Foreign Ministry also denounced the expulsion of the diplomats as ""groundless"" and ""an element of coordinated provocative policy with the Czech side...with the aim of boosting tension in international relations and within the region.""
The Zapad-2025 exercises will include drills on the possible use of nuclear weapons and the Russian-made, intermediate-range hypersonic Oreshnik missile, according to the Belarus defence minister.
NATO is holding drills on its side of the border at around the same time. Both Poland and Lithuania began exercises earlier this month, with allied troops taking part.

The EU on Friday slapped Google with a massive 2.95 billion euros ($3.47 billion) antitrust fine for favoring its own advertising services, drawing a furious rebuke from President Donald Trump and a threat of fresh tariffs against Europe.
Google vowed to appeal the decision by the European Commission, which accused the US firm of distorting competition in the 27-nation bloc.
""Google abused its dominant position in adtech, harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers. This behavior is illegal under EU antitrust rules,"" EU competition chief Teresa Ribera said.
Trump, who has threatened to go after Europe for its rules on the digital market and content policing, lashed out at the decision, which brings Google's total EU liabilities to nearly 10 billion euros.
""Very unfair, and the American taxpayer will not stand for it!"" Trump said on his Truth Social network, a day after hosting top tech leaders including Google CEO Sundar Pichai at the White House.
""As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand,"" he added, warning that if the fine is confirmed, he will launch proceedings to impose tariffs as retaliation.
The dustup came as the EU is still waiting for the United States to make good on a promise to lower tariffs on cars under a trade deal agreed in July.
In its decision, Brussels ordered Google to end its ""self-preferencing practices"" and take steps to cease its inherent conflicts of interest.
""Google has 60 days to inform the Commission on how it plans to do so,"" Ribera said.
""If it fails to propose a viable plan, the Commission will not hesitate to impose an appropriate remedy.""
She said that ""at this stage, it appears that the only way for Google to end its conflict of interest effectively is with a structural remedy, such as selling some part of its adtech business.""
Google said the commission's decision was wrong and it would appeal.
""It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,"" said the firm's global head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland.
Advertising is Google's financial bedrock. The firm's parent company Alphabet in July reported quarterly profits of $28.2 billion, largely from ads.
In its decision, the commission noted that Google not only sells advertising on its own websites and apps, but also acts as an intermediary for firms wanting to place ads elsewhere to appear on mobile and computer screens.
The European Publishers Council, a media industry group that had filed a complaint over the practices probed by the EU, said a fine was not enough.
""Without strong and decisive enforcement, Google will simply write this off as a cost of business while consolidating its dominance in the AI era,"" said its director Angela Mills Wade.
In a similar case, a US federal judge earlier this year decided against Google over its adtech practices. A trial to decide the remedies opens in Virginia on September 22.
Friday's announcement marked the third fine announced in a week against the Alphabet-owned Google.
A US federal jury on Wednesday ordered Google to pay about $425 million for gathering information from smartphone app users even when people opted for privacy settings.
The same day, France's data protection authority fined the search giant 325 million euros for failing to respect the law on internet cookies.
The group notched a major win, however, on Tuesday when a US judge rejected the American government's demand that Google sell its Chrome web browser.
The landmark antitrust ruling, coming after Google was found to have illegally maintained monopolies in online search through exclusive distribution agreements, did, however, impose sweeping data sharing requirements to restore competition.
As the EU's competition watchdog, the commission has hit Google with multiple fines in recent years.
It fined the online giant 4.1 billion euros in 2018 for abusing the market dominance of its Android operating system, and in 2017 slapped a 2.4 billion euos fine for anti-competitive practices in the price comparison market.

AI generated Text-to-speech
As Russian troops grind into eastern Ukraine, the Kremlin is advancing on another front in its battle for total control. This time, the target is its own population.
Taking a page from the Chinese playbook, Moscow is pushing its citizens to use a messaging app that gives the government access to user data, while isolating them from the rest of the internet.
The app, called Max, has drawn comparisons to China’s WeChat for its lack of end-to-end encryption and a privacy policy that allows authorities to access personal information such as chat logs, contacts, photos and location data.
“The app’s makers are basically saying they’ll hand everything over,” said Mikhail Klimarev, head of the exiled Russian Internet Protection Society.
To register on Max, a user must provide a Russian or Belarusian phone number, which in turn requires a government ID, meaning that any data collection is traceable to an individual.
“Anything you do on there will be available to the FSB,” Klimarev added, referring to Russia’s Federal Security Service.
Earlier this month, Max — whose logo is an innocuous speech bubble on a bluish background — announced that its user base had grown from 1 million people in early June to 30 million in September.
While that’s still far fewer than its rivals — WhatsApp remains by far the most popular messaging app in Russia, with an estimated96 million users, followed by Telegram with some 90 million users — Max has a powerful backer: the state.
It was only this June that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law for the creation of a “national messenger,” with Russian tech company VK chosen to develop it soon after. The company is effectively controlled by the state gas company Gazprom and Yuri Kovalchuk, a top ally of Putin. It’s run by the son of Putin’s aide, Sergei Kiriyenko. Both men are under U.S. sanctions.
As of the beginning of this month, all new phones sold in Russiamust be pre-installed with the app.
Meanwhile, Russia’s telecoms agency Roskomnadzor this summer began blocking calls on WhatsApp and Telegram. While the government described the move as an effort to protect users from scammers and terrorists, WhatsApp, owned by Meta,condemnedit as an attempt “to violate people’s right to secure communication.”
Independent mediareportthat civil servants, bank employeesand hospital staff have faced pressure to switch to Max. Meanwhile, the app is being promoted by officials at various levels and in social media campaigns asreliable and safe.
In a widely circulatedvideoposted online by a blogger in western Russia’s Penza, city loudspeakers can be heard grimly warning residents not to upload footage of  drones, before abruptly switching to promote Max as a way to “communicate conveniently and securely.”
A parallel campaign has featured Russian celebrities and influencers singing the app’s praises on social media. In onevideo, an influencer showed surprise that it worked “even inside the parking lot.” Аnotherbloggerwas blown away that it could be used “even in the elevator.”
Though still under development, Max is being touted as a tool that will, like WeChat, eventually include government, banking and commercial services.
VK and the Russian president’s press office did not reply to requests for comment. In comments carried by the state news agency TASS Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that WhatsApp and Telegram should remain in Russia as “competition” to Max.
Max is the latest step in Putin’s ambition to control the internet.
In 2019 the Russian president signed a law to create a “sovereign internet,” shielded from foreign influence. And since Putin’s all-out attack on Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has cracked down on online anti-war activism, with hundreds of criminal cases filed,accordingto OVD-Info, a police monitoring organization.
Thousands of websites have been blocked, and this summer the government criminalized searching for content designated as “extremist,” such as information connected to the anti-corruption foundation of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, what Russia calls the “LGBT” movement and even Meta. Advertising VPNs, a tool that allows Russians to elude identification and bypass censorship, has also been outlawed.
Sarkis Darbinyan, co-founder of the internet rights group RKS Global, described Max as the final brick in the Kremlin’s effort to build its own version of China’s Great Firewall.
“It’s trying to control communication between citizens, not just their behavior on public platforms,” Darbinyan said.
Like other tech experts, he said there’s nothing to stop Max from handing the authorities a user’s entire communication history, including unsent drafts and deleted messages. Draft dodgers, journalists, those in the LGBTQ+ community and other politically vulnerable groups should be worried, he said.
“It’s a spook in your pocket,” Darbinyan added.
Since a Russian or Belarusian phone number is required, the app is difficult to access abroad, isolating residents from relatives and contacts outside the country, just as the government restricts other forms of communication.
Max’s rollout has not been without friction.
The video from the parking lot has become the butt of countless memes, and Russia’s jingoistic military bloggers, many of whom have amassed huge followings on Telegram, have publicly criticized it as digital overreach.
According to a report by independent news outlet Meduza, government officials are also wary of the app.
Maxim, a 27-year-old schoolteacher from Moscow, whose surname is being withheld for safety reasons, said he wouldn’t be installing Max and criticized the measures against WhatsApp and Telegram.
“It’s an attempt by the government to limit our ability to write and communicate with each other,” he said. “I already can’t call abroad in a simple way like I used to.”
Nikolai Petrov, a senior analyst at the London-based New Eurasian Strategies Centre, said the Kremlin’s recent rush for digital control could have been influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump’s push for peace in Ukraine.
“For Vladimir Putin, it is very important to silence any potential voices of protest from across the entire political spectrum,” Petrov said, “including ultranationalists,” who he said would be against anything short of Ukraine’s total capitulation.
But like many independent Russian analysts, Petrov said he sees no sign the Kremlin is genuinely interested in peace. Moves like the rollout of Max are geared toward “ensuring complete control over the situation, no matter how the events unfold,” he said.
Just a few years ago, the Chinese model of a controlled internet seemed technologically and politically unthinkable in Russia. Not anymore.
“Today the Kremlin controls 90-95 percent of communication,” Petrov said. “Tomorrow it’ll be 99 percent.”

Israel responds with travel bans,oof-BidenGinsburged,2025-09-08 23:00:07,143,39,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Monday ratcheted up his criticism of Israel’s actions in the 23-monthIsrael-Hamas war, to which Israel responded by banning two left-wing Spanish ministers from the country.
Sánchez made the comments while announcing a raft of measures he said his government was taking to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to address thehumanitarian crisiscaused by its military offensive in the Gaza Strip.
“This is not self-defense, it’s not even an attack – it’s the extermination of a defenseless people. It is a violation of all humanitarian laws, and despite that, the international community is failing to stop this tragedy,” Sánchez said.
Besides formalizing an arms embargo, which the Spanish government says has been de facto in effect since October 2023, Spain will ban ships carrying fuel for Israel’s armed forces from passing through Spanish ports, and increase its humanitarian aid toward Gaza in 2026 to reach 150 million euros ($176 million), he said.
The measures would need to be approved in Parliament.
Other steps included a pledge to increase aid for the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, and to impose an embargo on goods made in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Additionally, anyone who directly participates in what Sánchez termed the “genocide” in Gaza would not be allowed to enter Spanish territory, he said.
“We know that all these measures will not be enough to stop the invasion or the war crimes, but we hope that they will serve to add pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government to alleviate some of the suffering that the Palestinian population is enduring,” Sánchez said.
Leading genocide scholars pass resolution saying Israel's actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide. Israel lambasted the accusation, saying it is based on a ""campaign of lies"" by Hamas. Jeremy Diamond has details.
International Association of Genocide Scholars: Israel’s actions meet the legal definition
In response, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Sánchez was trying to divert attention from the corruption scandals affecting his Socialist Party, and characterized the Spanish government’s actions as “antisemitic.”
Saar said on X that Israel had banned Spain’s labor minister, Yolanda Díaz, and Youth Minister Sira Rego from traveling to the country. Both belong to the government’s left-wing coalition partner Sumar. Saar said the ministers would be prohibited from entering Israel because they had made statements calling Israel a “genocidal state” and supported efforts to sanction or boycott Israel.
Spain’s government has been an outspoken critic of Israel’s war in Gaza, which began after Hamas-led militants killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on October 7, 2023, and abducted 251 hostages. Israel’s offensive has killed more than 64,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants.
Last year, Spain joined Norway and Ireland to formally recognize a Palestinian state and was the first European country to ask a UN court for permission to join South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza.
On Monday, Saar downplayed the effect the Spanish government’s actions would have on Israel.
“If they want to hold or halt defense connections with Israel,” Saar told reporters, “who do you think will lose from that? We don’t need Spain to protect the land of Israel.”

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — In a highly rare exercise of wartime legal restraint, Israel’s Supreme Court ruled Sunday that the Israeli government has deprived Palestinian detainees of even a minimum subsistence diet and ordered authorities to increase the amount and improve the quality of food served to deprived Palestinian inmates.
Although it’s the job of the Supreme Court to advise the government of the legality of its policies, the Israeli judiciary has seldom taken issue with its actions in the 23-month Israel-Hamas war.
Since Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, Israel has largely rejected growing international criticism of its conduct by arguing that it was doing what was necessary to defeat Hamas.
The Israeli army has detained large numbers of Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank on suspicion of militant ties. Thousands have been released from months of detention in camps and jails without charge totell of brutal conditions, includingovercrowding, scant food supplies, inadequate medical attention and scabies outbreaks.
As Israel’s highest tier of accountability, the Supreme Court hears complaints from individuals and organizations against Israeli government actions, such as its practice ofrestricting food and medical supplies to Gazaor, in this case, what two Israeli human rights groups described in their complaint as the security establishment’s “systemic policy” of depriving Palestinian prisoners of food.
The three-judge panel ruled unanimously that the Israeli government had a legal duty to provide Palestinian prisoners with three meals a day to ensure “a basic level of existence” and ordered authorities to fulfill that obligation.
In an unexpected 2-1 decision, the court furthermore accepted the petition filed last year by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, or ACRI, and the Israeli rights group Gisha, siding with their allegations that the government’s deliberate restriction of prisoners’ food in Israeli detention facilities has caused Palestinians to suffer malnutrition and starvation during the Israel-Hamas war.
“We are not speaking here of comfortable living or luxury, but of the basic conditions of survival as required by law,” the ruling said. “Let us not share in the ways of our worst enemies.”
Palestinian authorities have recorded the deaths at least 61 Palestinians in Israeli custody since the war started. In March, a 17-year-old Palestinian in Israel prisondied of what doctors said was likely starvation.
IsraeliNational Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the prison system, boasted last year that he degraded the conditions of security prisoners to the bare minimum required by Israeli law.
Ben-Gvir, who leads a small far-right ultranationalist party, lashed out at the court ruling Sunday.
“Are you from Israel?” he asked the judges, arguing that while Israeli hostages in Gaza have no one to help them, Israel’s Supreme Court defends Hamas “to our disgrace.” He vowed the policy of providing prisoners with “the most minimal conditions stipulated by law” would continue unchanged.
ACRI called on authorities to implement the verdict immediately. In a post on social media platform X, the rights group said Israel’s prison service has “turned Israeli prisons into torture camps.”
“A state must not starve people,” it said. “People must not starve people — no matter what they have done.”

Israelhas ordered the demolition of the two men's homes and said every structure built without permission in the towns of Qatanna and Qubeiba would be demolished.
Defence minister Israel Katz added that 750 people - who he said are the men's relatives and fellow villagers - will have their permits to work in Israel removed.
Analysis:The bus shooting has exacerbated already high tensions
Israel says demolishing the homes of attackers' relatives and neighbours is a deterrent to future assaults - but human rights groups and Palestinians consider the practice a form of collective punishment, prohibited by international law.
Benjamin Netanyahuvisited the scene of the shooting at Ramot Junction on Monday and has been assessing, with his heads of security, what happened.
Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday
The Israeli prime minister sent condolences to the families of the victims and said Israel was ""in an intense war against terror on several fronts"".
Among the dead in the shooting was a man of about 50 years old, three men aged around 30 and a woman aged about 50.
It is understood a total of about 15 people were injured, with six in a serious condition."

President Donald Trump on Sunday defended a massive immigration raid by federal agents on an electric-vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia operated by South Korean automaker Hyundai. South Korea says it has reached a deal with the U.S. for the release of detained South Korean workers.
Local leaders and immigrant activists speak out against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid on a Hyundai plant in rural Georgia
The South Korean government announced Sunday that 300 workers who were detained after a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A lawyer for several workers detained at a Hyundai factory in Georgia says many of the South Koreans rounded up in the immigration raid are engineers and equipment installers brought in for the highly specialized work of getting an electric battery plant online.
Atlanta immigration attorney Charles Kuck, who represents four of the detained South Korean nationals, told The Associated Press on Monday that many were doing work that is authorized under the B-1 business visitor visa program. They had planned to be in the U.S. for just a couple of weeks and “never longer than 75 days,” he said.
“The vast majority of the individuals that were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that were South Korean were either there as engineers or were involved in after-sales service and installation,” Kuck said.
The raid Thursdayat thebattery factoryunder construction at Hyundai’s sprawling auto plant west of Savannah resulted in the detainment of 475 workers, more than 300 them South Koreans. Some were shown being shackled with chains around their hands, ankles and waists in video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

(Corey Bullard/U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement via AP)
South Korea’s foreign minister was flying to the U.S. on Monday to secure his citizens’ return on a charter flight toSouth Korea,where many people have expressed confusion, shock and a sense of betrayal.
Speaking with reporters, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the Hyundai plant raid sends a clear signal.
President DonaldTrump said the workers “were here illegally,”and that instead, the U.S. needs to arrange with other countries to have their experts train U.S. citizens to do specialized work such as battery and computer manufacturing.
But immigration lawyer Kuck said no company in the U.S. makes the machines that are used in the Georgia battery plant, so they had to come from abroad to install or repair equipment on-site — work that would take about three to five years to train someone in the U.S. to do, he said.

“This is not something new,” Kuck said. “We’ve been doing this forever, and we do it — when we ship things abroad, we send our folks there to take care of it.”
While neither government has revealed details about all the workers’ visas, it’s not unusual for foreign companies to save time and money by sending workers from abroad to set up U.S. factories, and then train U.S. workers, said Rosemary Coates, executive director of the Reshoring Institute, a nonprofit that encourages U.S. manufacturing.
“We saw the same thing happening in the ‘80s with Japanese carmakers setting up U.S. factories, and in the ‘90s with German carmakers,” she said.
A B-1 visitor for business visa allows foreign workers to stay for up to six months, getting reimbursed for expenses while collecting a paycheck back home. There are limits — for example, they can supervise construction projects but can’t build anything themselves — but if it’s spelled out in a contract, they can install equipment, Los Angeles immigration lawyer Angelo Paparelli said.
Also, South Korea is one of 41 countries whose citizens can use the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which provides a visa waiver if they can provide “a legitimate reason’’ for their visit, and this basically gives them B-1 visa status for up to 90 days, said immigration attorney Rita Sostrin in Los Angeles.
Advocates called for the detained workers to be released during a news conference Monday at a church in Savannah, about 25 miles east of the site where Hyundai began producing electric vehicles a year ago.
They included Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition of Atlanta, who also said many of the detained South Korean workers had special skills needed to get the battery plant running.

Daniela Rodriguez, executive director of Migrant Equity Southeast, said immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela also were detained. She said the group’s Savannah office has been flooded with calls from family members of workers who they can’t reach and presume are detained.
Even some workers who weren’t detained feel unsafe about returning to their jobs at the site, she said.
Workers described seeing armed agents and military-style vehicles during the raid, Rodriguez said, while drones and helicopters hovered overhead. She said one woman who had a work permit and wasn’t detained told her: “We felt like we were being followed as animals, like they were hunting for us.”
A Savannah labor union leader said local unions have complained that Hyundai and its contractors were improperly using South Korean workers for basic construction that falls outside the visa waiver rules.
Christi Hulme, president of the Savannah Regional Central Labor Council, said unions that are part of her council believe Korean workers have been pouring cement, erecting steel, performing carpentry and fitting pipes.
“Basically our labor was being given to illegal immigrants,” Hulme said.
Spokespersons for Hyundai’s Georgia EV factory and the adjacent battery plant did not immediately reply to an email message seeking comment.
Appearing before his departure at a legislative hearing where many lawmakers lamented the American operation, Foreign Minister Cho Hyun called the raid by South Korea’s close ally “a very serious matter.”
“If U.S. authorities detain hundreds of Koreans in this manner, almost like a military operation, how can South Korean companies investing in the U.S. continue to invest properly in the future?” said Cho Jeongsik, a lawmaker from the liberal governing Democratic Party.
Some lawmakers called for retaliatory investigations of Americans who allegedly work illegally in South Korea.
Experts say the raid won’t likely prompt any major tit-for-tat measures given how muchthe country depends on the U.S. for securityin deterring potentialNorth Koreanaggression and other spheres of cooperation, including business ties.
This was the Homeland Security agency’s largest workplace raid yet as it pursues itsmass deportation agenda, and it targeted Georgia — a symbol of bilateral cooperation where many large South Korean businesses operate and plan future investments. Only weeks ago, South Korea promised hundreds of billions in U.S. investments to reach a tariff deal. Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung held theirfirst summitin Washington on Aug. 25.
“The way that Trump is pressuring the Korean government and inflicting damages on its people is very rough and unilateral,” said Kim Taewoo, former head of Seoul’s Korea Institute for National Unification. “Can this be forgotten easily in South Korea? In a long-term perspective, it won’t be good for U.S. national interests as well.”

In his regular public address, Zelenskyy said Russia had launched a total of 810 drones in one wave, including over 400 Shahed loitering munitions.
His tally indicates that nearly a fifth of the drone wave was downed that evening byinterceptor drones— an emerging low-cost air defense that Ukraine is rushing to produce at scale.
""Of course, not everything is being shot down yet, and we still need to further strengthen our air defenses,"" Zelenskyy said inhis address.
Interceptor drones, originally made to catch and destroy reconnaissance craft, are high-speed uncrewed aerial systems that must fly fast enough tochase down their targetmidair and crash into it.
Many of these are first-person-view drones that feed live camera footage to a pilot who must fly the system into its target. With Russia's growing use of the Shahed, Ukraine is now pivoting its interceptor development to fight loitering munitions.
As with much of Ukraine's homegrown drone technology, the effort is largely decentralized, driven by a range of local manufacturers. Each produces its own drone, which is sold or donated to Ukrainian air defense troops in coordination with the government.
""This is a top priority,"" Zelenskyy said on Sunday. ""Russians keep the number of Shaheds in massive strikes at the level of 300 to 400 per strike, and our interceptors must reach a matching level. This is realistic.""
The rest of Ukraine's air defense system relies on jamming, air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air missiles, andmobile fire groups, which are vehicle crews equipped with mounted machine guns.
But they've often been overwhelmed by the sheer number of drones Russia launches in one wave. Moscow has increasingly started accumulating attack drones and ballistic missiles to launch them in greater numbers at the same time.
The Shahed-136,originally of Iranian design, has been a staple of those nightly barrages. The drone is known to fly roughly at a top speed of 115 mph, so an interceptor must usually be faster to catch up to the Shahed after detecting the Russian craft.
The Kremlin also deploys a similar drone, known as the Gerbera, designed to mimic the Shahed in a bid tooverwhelm Ukraine's air defenses. Kyiv thus hopes interceptors can soon be used as a cheap, reliable way to counter the onslaught. One Shahed is roughly estimated to cost Russia about $35,000 per unit, while many interceptors typically cost between $2,000 and $6,000 each.
Zelenskyy said on Sunday that his government has been securing financing and contracts for interceptors.
""Developing this interceptor technology, deploying it, training crews, all of this saves lives,"" he said.
Ukraine said that the drone attack on Sunday — the one referred to by Zelenskyy — was Russia's biggest wave so far. Roughly 56 drones made it past Ukrainian air defenses, with at least one impacting Kyiv's parliamentary headquarters, officials said.
At least four people, including an infant, were killed in the attack, Ukrainian authorities said.

Robert Johnson, the billionaire co-founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET), has donated $500,000 to Virginia Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears' gubernatorial campaign after she was targeted by a racist sign at an Arlington County school board meeting.
Newsweekreached out via email to Johnson through his hotel investment company, RLJ Lodging Trust, and the Earle-Sears campaign for comment.
""VirginiaDemocratsunanimously, forcefully and unequivocally condemned the racist sign in Arlington—period,"" Lamont Bagby, a Black state senator and former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, toldNewsweekin part via email on Friday.
Johnson's hefty donation, first reported by Politico, comes afterRepublicancandidate Earle-Sears was greeted with a sign targeting her last week at an Arlington County, Virginia, school board meeting.
The incident has since garnered millions of views on social media due to what was scribed on the sign: ""Hey Winsome, if trans can't share your bathroom, then blacks can't share my water fountain.""
Earle-Sears, who has served in her current role since 2022, called the display ""a shame,"" telling localABCaffiliate 7News that Democrats are ""spewing hate."" Some Virginia Democrats, in remarks toNewsweekand on social media, have condemned the sign.
The sign was held by a Democratic volunteer who, according to 7News, has been canvassing for Democrats for years.
It has prompted individuals like Johnson, an entrepreneur and business magnate who formerly supported Democrats, includingHillary Clintonin 2008 and 2016, andTerry McAuliffein a previous state gubernatorial election, tocontributeto the Earle-Sears campaign.
Johnson, in a statement provided to Politico, said he was ""so appalled by that racist diatribe ... that I choose to show the voters of Virginia how Black Brothers stand up to defend and support their Black Sisters.""
Virginia Democrats, including Lamont Bagby, a Black state senator and former member of the Virginia House of Delegates, refuted claims from Earle-Sears andRepublicansthat members of his party supported the sign's message.
""Virginia Democrats unanimously, forcefully and unequivocally condemned the racist sign in Arlington—period,"" Bagby toldNewsweekvia email on Friday. ""Winsome Sears' actions and rhetoric mirrorDonald Trumpand his attacks on Black institutions and leaders, undermining the very progress our communities have fought for.
""It is no surprise she's even cast doubt on the legacy ofBrown v. Board of Education, invoked slavery to attack diversity programs, and supported defunding public schools in Black communities and cutting community health centers that all Virginians rely on for care. We've come too far, and we won't allow Virginia to go backwards.""
Bagby, nor the Virginia Democrats, remarked on Johnson's half-million-dollar donation.
Virginia Representative Abigail Spanberger, who is running as the Democratic nominee for governor, wrote in an X post on August 22 that the sign was ""racist and abhorrent.""
""Many Virginians remember the segregated water fountains (and buses and schools and neighborhoods) of Virginia's recent history,"" Spanberger said. ""And no matter the intended purpose or tone and no matter how much one might find someone else's beliefs objectionable, to threaten a return of Jim Crow and segregation to a Black woman is unacceptable. Full stop.""
The Arlington Democratic Committee, which helped organize the rally to protest Earle-Sears, stated that the woman holding the sign is not affiliated with them and that they are not familiar with her, according to 7News.
""What happened in Arlington wasn't just about a meeting,"" Virginia Democrats' Vice Chair Marc Broklawski wrote on X last weekend. ""It was about the climate Winsome Sears is creating, one where contempt is currency and neighbors are turned against each other.""
In 2008, Johnson supported Hillary Clinton overBarack Obamaand was even described as a ""HillRaiser"" at the time. A joke he made then about Obama believed to reference the eventual president's past marijuana use was downplayed by the Clinton campaign, and it later led to Johnson issuing an apology to Obama—who he wanted to pick Clinton as his running mate.
Johnson, however, later made a remark that Obama would not be theDemocratic Party's nominee if he were not Black. Johnson said at the time: ""I make a joke about Obama doing drugs [and it's] 'Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man.'""
Johnson also attempted to urge Black Americans to give Donald Trump a chance following his 2016 victory, noting how he personally knew Trump for years. That included meeting Trump at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Virginia Lieutenant Governor Winsome Earle-Sears to 7News:""Remember who I am. I'm an immigrant to this wonderful country, and not only that, but I'm a Black woman, and so I'm second in command in the former capital of the Confederate States. For her to talk about a water fountain that Blacks—she started with me and then she went to Black people in general—can't be at her water fountain. When did you start owning the water fountains, my good friend? And I thought the water fountains belong to everybody. Are we going back to Klan days now?""
TheVirginia gubernatorial electionwill be held on November 4, 2025, to elect a replacement for the term-limited incumbent Republican GovernorGlenn Youngkin.
A poll published by Roanoke College last week showed Spanberger leading Earle-Sears, 46-39 percent. She has led her Republican counterpart in every major poll released in the past two months, including a Virginia Commonwealth University poll in July showing her with a 12-point lead. The Decision Desk HQ average in early August showed Spanberger leading with an average of 45.2 percent compared to 36 percent for Earle-Sears.

Inside the gated compounds live some of India's richest, while in the slums nearby live poor migrant workers -  mostly domestic helpers, garbage-pickers and daily-wage workers - who keep the affluence going.
Last month, local authorities rounded up hundreds of these workers, most of whom say they are Bengali-speaking Muslims from India's West Bengal state, in a ""verification"" drive targeting illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.
The suspects were detained and kept at ""holding centres"" where they were asked to provide documents to prove their citizenship. Many allege they were beaten and mistreated by police during the process. Police officials deny these allegations.
""I had my voter and national ID cards, but they told me they were fake. I spent six days not knowing my fate before I was finally released,"" said Ather Ali Sheikh, a daily-wage worker, who has lived in the city for 15 years.
The action has left indelible scars on the social fabric of the city, which prides itself on its cosmopolitan culture. Hundreds of workers have fled overnight - abandoning jobs, homes and, in some cases, even families in their haste to escape.
""I still don't understand why they suddenly came after me,"" Mr Sheikh said. Behind him, his wife hurriedly packed their belongings - torn clothes, old utensils and school books - into flimsy boxes.
""Was it because of my language, my religion or because I am poor? "" Mr Sheikh continued, his face hardening with anger. ""Why weren't the rich Bengali residents held up?""
Police in Gurugram deny targeting any particular community. ""Neither religion nor class has anything to do with the drive,"" public relations officer Sandeep Kumar told the BBC.
He added that out of the 250 people picked up, only 10 have been identified as illegal migrants and will actually be deported.
""Everyone else was released. No one was mistreated at the centres. We have been completely fair and objective.""
Meanwhile, trepidation is being felt on other side of the city as well.
With no workers left, heaps of trash have been overflowing from public bins and dump yards on to the streets, inconveniencing residents.
""Our house help and her husband, who worked as a driver, both left and now we have no help,"" said Tabassum Bano, who lives in one of the complexes.
Crackdowns on alleged illegal immigrants from Muslim-majority Bangladesh are not new in India. The countries are divided by a  porous border 4,096km (2,545-mile) long, and have seen waves of movement of people on both sides.
But these efforts seem to have intensified under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
In recent months, hundreds of people, including a veteran Muslim officer of the Indian Army, have been arrested on suspicion of being illegal migrants.
In the north-eastern state of Assam, where the issue has been a potent flashpoint for decades, authorities have been""pushing back"" hundreds of Bengali-Muslimsinto Bangladesh on suspicion of them being ""illegal Bangladeshis"".
Deportations are also under way in Delhi, where some 700 people were picked up and flown out to border states in the last six months.
This has had a chilling impact on the marginalised community.
In Gurugram, a sense of shock prevailed over their dust-blanketed colonies.
""For years, we have cleaned and collected their garbage. Now we are being treated like it ourselves,"" said Rauna Bibi.
A domestic help, Rauna's husband had returned from West Bengal the same day the detentions began. When he heard about it, he was so terrified he left again - this time, without informing his wife.
""For three days, I wondered if he was picked up; whether he was even alive,"" Rauna said. ""When we finally spoke, he said he didn't call because he did not want any trouble.""
But it was not her husband's behaviour that bothered Rauna, or the fact that he was now jobless. It was the theft of her pride - and the comfort of belonging to a place - that hurt her the most, making her feel absurdly insignificant.
""Unlike poverty, I can't fight this with my hard work,"" she said. ""If they pick us, I wouldn't know how to survive. This slum, the work we do and the houses we clean - this is our entire life.""
Mr Kumar says the recent action is based on a home ministry notice from May that lays down new guidelines for deporting illegal immigrants.
Under the order, all states are required to set up a special task force along with holding centres to ""detect, identify and deport/send back illegal immigrants settled from Bangladesh and Myanmar"".
Each person would be given 30 days to prove their citizenship, during which authorities would send their documents back to their home districts for verification.
If they fail to confirm the details, the suspects would be taken by the police ""under proper escort, in groups as far as possible"", and handed over to the border forces for deportation.
Critics, however, have questioned the order, saying it does not specify the basis on which a person is made a suspect.
""On the face of it, it's nothing other than the fact that you speak Bengali, have a Muslim name and live in shanty,"" said Aakash Bhattacharya, of the national council of the All India Central Council of Trade Unions which advocates for workers' rights.
What is worse is that none of the suspects are being given certificates confirming their citizenship had already been verified, he added.
""This means they can be put through the same process again, making them extremely vulnerable.""
Mr Kumar says the detentions in Gurugram were made on the basis of strong preliminary evidence.
""We checked their phones and found suspicious contacts from Bangladesh. Some of them also failed to answer questions about their ancestry during interrogation,"" he said.
Suhas Chakma, a human rights worker, says that the policy is not necessarily religious-specific.
""The arrest of the Muslims appears to be more as they constitute about 95% of Bangladesh's population,"" he explained.
But for a country that has seen an influx of refugees for decades, India does need a wider refugee law to address many of these complex issues, he added.
For now, Bengali-Muslims are living with a deep sense of foreboding.
Many of them have been sleeping with documents tucked under the pillow in case  misfortune strikes.
""We were already fighting the harsh reality of our lives. Now we have to fight this too,"" said Rabi-ul-Hassan, a resident of Jai Hind camp, a massive slum located in one of the poshest corners of Delhi.
Three weeks ago, authorities cut off electricity in the area, instantly plunging some 400 people into darkness.
The action came after a court ruled that the slum-dwellers, who say they have lived there for generations, were squatting on private land.
""They did this even when the area is recognised as a legal slum by the city's own urban planning organisation,"" said Abhik Chimni, a lawyer who is challenging the order.
Since then residents have been in some kind of stupor, dazed, angry and tired. ""The heat is unbearable. The food keeps rotting and the children don't stop crying. At night, we try to sleep outside but then mosquitoes bite us,"" said Baijan Bibi.
""I am so exhausted,"" she continued, ""that sometimes I wonder if it's better to live in a holding centre. At least there will be a fan there, right?""
The US President wants to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine.

BEIJING (AP) — The body camera hung from the top of the IV drip, recording the slightest twitch made by Yang Guoliang as he lay bloody and paralyzed in a hospital bed after a police beating with bricks.
By then, surveillance was nothing new for the Yang family in rural China, snared in an intricate network based on U.S. technology that spies on them and predicts what they’ll do.
Their train tickets, hotel bookings, purchases, text messages and phone calls are forwarded to the government. Their house is ringed with more than a dozen cameras. They’ve tried to go to Beijing 20 times in the past few years, but masked men show up and grab them, often before they depart. And last year, Yang’s wife and younger daughter were detained and now face trial for disrupting the work of the Chinese state — a crime carrying a sentence of up to a decade in prison.
Yet the Yangs say they are not criminals. They are simply farmers trying to beg Beijing to stop local officials from seizing their 1 1/2 acres of land in China’s eastern Jiangsu province.
“Every move in my own home is monitored,” Yang said, sitting behind black curtains that block him from the glare of police lights trained straight at his house. “Their surveillance makes me feel unsafe all the time, everywhere.”
The AP obtained tens of thousands of pages of classified and internal documents that show how U.S. companies designed and marketed systems that became the foundation for China’s digital cage. (AP Video/Serginho Roosblad, Marshall Ritzel)
Across China, tens of thousands of people tagged as troublemakers like the Yangs are trapped in a digital cage, barred from leaving their province and sometimes even their homes by the world’s largest digital surveillance apparatus. Most of this technology came from companies in a country that has long claimed to support freedoms worldwide: the United States.
Over the past quarter century, American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, playing a far greater role in enabling human rights abuses than previously known, an Associated Press investigation found. They sold billions of dollars of technology to the Chinese police, government and surveillance companies,despite repeated warningsfrom the U.S. Congressandin the mediathat such tools were being used toquash dissent,persecute religious sectsandtarget minorities.
Critically, American surveillance technologies alloweda brutal mass detention campaignin the far west region of Xinjiang — targeting, tracking and grading virtually the entire native Uyghur population to forcibly assimilate and subdue them.
U.S. companies did this by bringing “predictive policing” to China — technology that sucks in and analyzes data to prevent crime, protests, or terror attacks before they happen. Such systems mine a vast array of information — texts, calls, payments, flights, video, DNA swabs, mail deliveries, the internet, even water and power use — to unearth individuals deemed suspicious and predict their behavior. But they also allow Chinese police to threaten friends and family and preemptively detain people for crimes they have not even committed.

For example, the AP found a Chinese defense contractor, Huadi, worked with IBM to design the main policing system known as the “Golden Shield” for Beijing to censor the internet and crack down on alleged terrorists, the Falun Gong religious sect, and even villagers deemed troublesome, according to thousands of pages of classified government blueprints taken out of China by a whistleblower, verified by AP and revealed here for the first time. IBM and other companies that responded said they fully complied with all laws, sanctions and U.S. export controls governing business in China, past and present.
Across China, surveillance systems track blacklisted “key persons,” whose movements are restricted and monitored. In Xinjiang, administrators logged people as high, medium, or low risk, often according to 100-point scores with deductions for factors like growing a beard, being 15 to 55 years old, or just being Uyghur.

Some tech companies even specifically addressed race in their marketing. Dell and a Chinese surveillance firmpromoted a “military-grade” AI-powered laptop with “all-race recognition” on Dell’s official WeChat accountin 2019. And until contacted by AP in August, biotech giant Thermo Fisher Scientific’s website marketedDNA kits to the Chinese policeas “designed” for the Chinese population,including “ethnic minorities like Uyghurs and Tibetans.”
While the flood of American technology slowed considerably starting in 2019 after outrage andsanctions over atrocities in Xinjiang,it laid the foundation for China’s surveillance apparatus that Chinese companies have since built on and in some cases replaced. To this day, concerns remain over where technology sold to China will end up.
For example, 20 former U.S. officials and national security expertswrote a letter in late Julycriticizinga deal for Nvidia to sell H20 chips used in artificial intelligence to China, with 15% of revenues going to the U.S. government. They said no matter who the chip is sold to, it will fall into the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.
Nvidia said it does not make surveillance systems or software, does not work with police in China and has not designed the H20 for police surveillance. Nvidia posted on its WeChat social media account in 2022 that Chinese surveillance firms Watrix andGEOAI used its chips to train AI patrol dronesandsystems to identify people by their walk, but told the AP those relationships no longer continue. The White House and Department of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.
Thermo Fisherand hard drive makerSeagate promoted their products to Chinese police at conferencesand trade shows this year, according to online posts. Officers stroll the streets of Beijing with Motorola walkie talkies. Nvidia and Intel chips remain critical for Chinese policing systems, procurements show. Andcontracts to maintain existing IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft software and gear remain ubiquitous,often with third parties.
What started in China more than a decade ago could be seen as a cautionary tale for other countries at a time when the use of surveillance technology worldwide is rising sharply, including in the United States. Emboldened by the Trump administration, U.S. tech companies are more powerful than ever, andPresident Donald Trump has rolled back a Biden-era executive ordermeant to safeguard civil rights from new surveillance technologies.
As the capacity and sophistication of such technologies has grown, so has their reach. Surveillance technologies now include AI systems that help track and detain migrants in the U.S. andidentify people to kill in the Israel-Hamas war. China, in the meantime, has used what it learned from the U.S. to turn itself into a surveillance superpower, selling technologies to countries like Iran and Russia.
The AP investigation was based on tens of thousands of leaked emails and databases from a Chinese surveillance company; tens of thousands of pages of confidential corporate and government documents; public Chinese language marketing material; and thousands of procurements, many provided by ChinaFile, a digital magazine published by the non-profit Asia Society. The AP also drew from dozens of open record requests and interviews with more than 100 current and former Chinese and American engineers, executives, experts, officials, administrators, and police officers.
Though the companies often claim they aren’t responsible for how their products are used, some directly pitched their tech as tools for Chinese police to control citizens, marketing material from IBM, Dell, Cisco, and Seagate show. Their sales pitches — made both publicly and privately — cited Communist Party catchphrases on crushing protest, including “stability maintenance,” “key persons,” and“abnormal gatherings,”and named programs that stifle dissent, such as “Internet Police,”“Sharp Eyes”and the “Golden Shield.”
Other companies, like Intel, Nvidia, Oracle, Thermo Fisher, Motorola, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Western Digital, creator of mapping software ArcGIS Esri, and what was then Hewlett Packard, or HP, also sold technology or services knowingly to Chinese police or surveillance companies. Four practicing lawyers said sales like those uncovered by AP could potentially go against at least the spirit, if not the letter, of U.S. export laws at the time, which the companies denied.
In 2009, Chinese defense contractor Huadi worked with IBM to build national intelligence systems, including a counterterrorism database, used by the Chinese military and China’s secret police, the Ministry of State Security. Chinese agents sold IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to the same ministry and to Chinese police, including in Xinjiang, through the 2010s, leaked emails and marketing posts show. IBM said it has no record of its i2 software ever having been sold to the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.
Nvidia and Intel partnered with China’s three biggest surveillance companies to add AI capabilities to cameras used for video surveillance across China, including Xinjiang and Tibet, until sanctions were imposed. Nvidia said in a post dating to at least 2013 that it collaborated with a Chinese police research institute on advanced surveillance technology.
IBM, Oracle, HP, and ArcGIS developer Esri sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of geographic and mapping software to Chinese police that allows officers to detect when blacklisted Uyghurs, Tibetans or dissidents stray out of provinces or villages. As late as 2019, with detentions in Xinjiang well underway, Dell hosted an industry summit in its capital. Dell and then-subsidiary VMWare sold cloud software and storage devices to police and entities providing data to police in Tibet and Xinjiang, even in 2022 after abuses there became widely known.
Huadi worked with IBM to construct China’s national fingerprint database; IBM told AP it never sold “fingerprinting-specific product or technology” to the Chinese government “in violation of US law”. HP and VMWare sold technology used for fingerprint comparison by Chinese police, while Intel partnered with a Chinese fingerprinting company to make their devices more effective. IBM, Dell, and VMWare also promoted facial recognition to Chinese police. China’s police and police DNA labs bought Dell and Microsoft software and equipment to save genetic data on police databases.
In 2016, Dell boasted on its WeChat account that its services assisted the Chinese internet police in “cracking down on rumormongers.” Seagate said on WeChat in 2022 that it sells hard drives “tailor made” for AI video systems in China for use by police to help them ”control key persons,” despite facing backlash for selling drives in Xinjiang.

“Everything was built on American tech,” said Valentin Weber, a researcher at the German Council on Foreign Relations who studied the use of U.S. tech by Chinese police. “China’s capability was close to zero.”
IBM, Dell, Cisco, Intel, Thermo Fisher and Amazon Web Services all said they adhere to export control policies. Seagate and Western Digital said they adhere to all relevant laws and regulations where they operate.
Oracle, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and tech conglomerate Broadcom, which acquired VMWare and cloud company Pivotal in 2023, did not comment on the record; HP, Motorola and Huadi did not respond, and Esri denied involvement but did not reply to examples. Microsoft told AP it found no evidence that it “knowingly sold technology to the military or police” as part of updates to the “Golden Shield”.

Some U.S. companies ended contracts in China over rights concerns and after sanctions. For example, IBM said it has prohibited sales to Tibet and Xinjiang police since 2015, and suspended business relations with defense contractor Huadi in 2019.
However, sanctions experts noted that the laws have significant loopholes and often lag behind new developments. For example, a ban on military and policing gear to China after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre does not take into account newer technologies or general-use products that can be applied in policing.
They also noted that the law around export controls is complicated. Raj Bhala, an expert in international trade law at the University of Kansas, said the issues the AP described fell into “the kind of gray area that we put in exams.”
“It would raise concerns about possible inconsistencies, possible violations,” said Bhala, who emphasized he was speaking generally and not about any specific company. “But I really stress ‘possible.’ We need to know more facts.”
While German, Japanese and Korean firms also played a role, American tech firms were by far the biggest suppliers.
The Xinjiang government said in a statement that it uses surveillance technologies to “prevent and combat terrorist and criminal activity,” that it respects citizens’ privacy and legal rights and that it does not target any particular ethnicity. The statement said Western countries also use such technology, calling the U.S. “a true surveillance state.” Other government agencies did not respond to a request for comment, including China’s police and authorities in the Yangs’ province.
This technology still powers the police database that controls the Yangs and other ordinary people.An estimate based on Chinese government statisticsfound at least 55,000 to 110,000 were put under residential surveillance in the past decade, andvast numbers are restricted from travel in Xinjiang and Tibet. China’s cities, roads and villages are now studded with more cameras than the rest of the world combined, analysts say — one for every two people.
“Because of this technology … we have no freedom at all,” said Yang Guoliang’s elder daughter, Yang Caiying, now in exile in Japan. “At the moment, it’s us Chinese that are suffering the consequences, but sooner or later, Americans and others, too, will lose their freedoms.”

Back when China was emerging from the chaotic violence of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, three in four Chinese were farmers, including the Yangs. They lived in a three-room home of tiles and pounded earth nestled among the lush, humid fields of the Yangtze River delta.
After Chairman Mao Zedong’s death that year, Beijing’s new leaders opened China to the world, and American tech firms like HP and IBM rushed in. But there were hard limits on how much change the government would accept. In 1989, the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests rattled Beijing,which sent tanks and troops to shoot students.
Soon after, Beijing began planningthe “Golden Shield,”aimed at digitizing China’s police force.
In 2001, the 9/11 al-Qaida attacks turbocharged interest in surveillance technology.One researcher claimed authorities could have foiled the attack by unearthing connections between hijackers through public information in databases.
American companies cashed in, selling the U.S. billions of dollars in surveillance technologies they said could prevent crime and terror attacks.
They spotted the same sales opportunity in China. Researchers warned surveillance technologies would be“instruments of repression”in the hands of authoritarian states. Yet IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and other American companies clinched orders to supply Beijing’s “Golden Shield.”
“China didn’t have this kind of thing before,” said Wang, a former Chinese police official in Xinjiang who asked to be identified only by last name for fear of retaliation. “These concepts all came from the West.”
Soon, disturbing stories emerged.Chinese police blocked sensitive news, pinpointing dissidents with unnerving precision. They stalked adherents of the Falun Gong sect banned by authorities. Congress demanded explanations from tech companies.
In 2008,documents leaked to the pressshowed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web.Followers sued Cisco, which is now petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to throw out the lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit.
At a human rights conference in February, then-Cisco lawyer Katie Shay said companies had a responsibility to understand how customers might misuse their technology for “surveillance and censorship.”
“A lot of people have suffered at the hands of their government, and I want to acknowledge that pain,” said Shay, who left Cisco in June. “I also will say that Cisco disputes the allegations of Cisco’s involvement.”
Cisco told the AP it is committed to human rights, but the court allegations may “open the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services.”
As Cisco was summoned before Congress, IBM partnered with a Chinese defense contractor on Phase Two of China’s “Golden Shield.”
Classified government blueprints obtained by AP show that in 2009, IBM worked withHuadi, the state-owned subsidiary of China’s biggest missile military contractor spun off from China’s Ministry of Defense, to build out predictive policing.
“Consolidate Communist Party rule,” read the Huadi blueprint, which showed the databases would track hundreds of thousands of people online.
In response to AP’s questions, IBM referred to any possible relationship it may have had with Chinese government agencies as “old, stale interactions”:
“ ... If older systems are being abused today — and IBM has no knowledge that they are — the misuse is entirely outside of IBM’s control, was not contemplated by IBM decades ago, and in no way reflects on IBM today.”
Back in 2009, Beijing needed the technology urgently to quash critics bonding online. Among them were the Yangs.

In April that year, local authorities ordered the Yangs and more than 300 other families in their village off their land. Developers coveted their prime lakefront property for “Western-style” apartments and villas, with fountains, football fields and shopping centers.
The Yangs had no idea police were installing systems that could target families like theirs. They just knew their land was being seized — in return for just a unit in a five-floor walk-up, too many stairs for their elderly mother to climb.
The Yangs and other farmers across China filed complaints.
“I discovered the way the government took our land was illegal,” Yang Caiying said. “They cheated us.”

In July 2009, three months after the Yang land was seized,riots erupted on the other side of the country in Xinjiang. Gory images of a Uyghur lynched at a toy factory spread online, angry Uyghurs took to the streets, and hundreds were killed.
Once again, American firms pitched their technology as the solution.
The government sent troops and cut Xinjiang’s phone and internet connections. In secret meetings, officials concluded that police had failed to spot the danger signs because they couldn’t identify Uyghurs deemed separatists, terrorists, and religious extremists, three engineers then working for the Xinjiang government told AP.
At the time, Xinjiang police and data systems were already running on American technology including IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft, the engineers said, which AP verified by reviewing government contracts. But the databases were unconnected.
So Xinjiang launched an ambitious initiative to fuse data from all available sources, including banks, railways, and phone companies, into a central database. Officials demanded complete information on all suspicious individuals and their relatives going back three generations, according to the engineers, who described specific meetings in which they participated. Two asked to remain anonymous, fearing for their family in China; the third, Nureli Abliz, is now in Germany.
Soon, lucrative contracts went up for bidding. Among those seeking to profit was IBM.
“Prevent problems before they happen,” IBM promised Chinese officials. In an August 2009 pamphlet, IBM cited the Xinjiang riots and said its technology could help the government “ensure urban safety and stability.”
IBM executives fanned out across the country to court Chinese officials.In December 2009, they set up a new “IBM Institute for Electronic Governance Innovation” in Beijing. In 2011, IBM acquired i2, a software program designed to prevent “terrorist threats.” IBM touted i2’s ability to analyze Chinese social media and licensed a Shanghai-based firm called Landasoft to sell it to China’s police,corporate records show.
Chinese police purchased tens of millions of dollars’ worth of products from companies like IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and Microsoft to upgrade the “Golden Shield” policing systems, a leaked accounting ledger acquired by AP from a whistleblower shows.
In the confrontation between the Chinese state and its critics, American technology tipped the scales of power.
In 2011, thieves ransacked the Yangs’ house, hunting for their property deed. They didn’t find it.

Two years later, bald men with tattoos and gold chains smashed down their door, shattered windows and flipped furniture to bully them out of their home anyway. Yang’s mother dropped to the floor in terror. Doctors diagnosed a heart attack, but the Yangs didn’t have money for a pacemaker.
Furious, the Yangs sued local police. In June 2015, a judge ruled their land had been seized illegally. The Yangs celebrated.
But just weeks after the ruling, officers identified human rights lawyers through the “Golden Shield” technology,cuffed hundreds of them and pressed them into police vans across China. One lawyer later recalled howpolice monitored his messages on human rights in WeChatbefore they grabbed him, shackled him to a chair, and tortured him.
Overnight, China’s budding rights-defense movement was dealt a fatal blow — and with it, the Yangs’ case. The Yangs were called in and curtly told the judgment was being overturned, their lawsuit dismissed without trial.
“We really had too much faith in the law, you know?” Yang Guoliang said, his hands clenched in fists. “It turned out to be worthless.”

In the meantime,Beijing was transforming Xinjiang into the most heavily surveilled place on earth, sweeping around a million people into camps and prisons.
When bombs tore through a train station in Xinjiang’s capital hours after a visit by leader Xi Jinping in 2014, Xi demanded a crackdown.
“He was super angry,” said Abliz, one of the engineers with the Xinjiang government. “They concluded they weren’t surveilling Uyghurs closely enough.”
The next year, in April 2015, Abliz attended a closed-door exposition in Xinjiang. A booth ran by Landasoft, the former IBM partner, caught his eye.
After years as a vendor of IBM’s i2 police surveillance analysis software to Xinjiang police, Landasoft had struck out on its own, touting i2-like software it said could detain extremists before they caused trouble. The similarity was no coincidence: Landasoft’s software was copied from i2, according to leaked emails and records.
In this two-image composite taken from screenshots, marketing materials obtained by the AP show IBM’s i2 software, left, later being replicated by China’s Landasoft’s iTap software to show how connections were drawn between individuals considered suspicious. (AP Photo)
“The platform is developed based on i2,” a Landasoft project manager wrote in an email.
It used a proprietary data visualization system developed by i2. The software powered what was called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, or IJOP, with the authority to trigger arrests.
Abliz went numb.
“I thought then that this was the end of humanity,” he said.

Landasoft did not respond to repeated requests for comment. IBM said it cut ties with Landasoft in 2014 and was not aware of any interaction between Landasoft and the Public Security Bureau in Xinjiang.
In the autumn of 2015, months after the Xinjiang expo, Landasoft signed contracts with Xinjiang police, emails show. Workers installed millions of cameras and wiredover 7,000 police outposts, often built just hundreds of meters apart.Nearly 100,000 officerswere recruited to pound on doors and collect names, addresses, fingerprints and face-scans.
Though Chinese hardware was favored, foreign software was irreplaceable for its performance and compatibility with China’s American-built systems, engineers told AP. That included server and database software from Oracle and Microsoft and cloud software from VMWare, which Dell acquired in 2016.
In this image from a screenshot, a 2014 slide from an internal VMWare marketing presentation obtained by AP demonstrates how police in China’s southwest Yunnan province used their cloud software to centralize data management and access across disparate police bureaus. (AP Photo)
In late 2016, the crackdown began. Internal documents, a leaked copy of the Landasoft software and interviews with 16 former Xinjiang police officers, officials and engineers reveal how the system worked.
Landasoft’s software combined data fed into a central police database to compilea dossier on vast swaths of Xinjiang’s population, tagging them with categories like “went on pilgrimage” or “studied abroad.” Administrators then questioned them, computed risk scores and decided who to detain.
Hundreds of thousands of people were tagged “untrustworthy”, leaked messages show.Leaked documents show the IJOP flagged 24,412 people as “suspicious” in just one week in 2017, leading to most being detained.
“They thought it better to grab thousands of innocents than let a single criminal slip free,” Abliz said.
The technology was crude and flawed. Landasoft emails show engineers frantically fixing a software bug to release hundreds of people categorized as high-risk. And surveillance cameras often misidentified people, a former Xinjiang police officer found when he checked their ID cards.
Yet officers were told “computers cannot lie” and that the IJOP’s listed targets were “absolutely correct,” Abliz said. The software’s orders were often obeyed fearfully, unquestioningly.
“The tech companies told the government their software is perfect,” Abliz said. “It’s all a myth.”

The all-encompassing surveillance forced total compliance: Officers arrested colleagues, neighbors informed on each other.
In May 2017, Kalbinur Sidik, a teacher now in the Netherlands, was summoned to her district government office in a yellow brick apartment building in Xinjiang’s capital. A young Uyghur woman, fresh from college, rose and introduced herself as a local official. Sidik, the woman explained, was being appointed as the head of her building, responsible for collecting information on neighbors.
“What’s this data going to be used for?” Sidik asked.
The woman looked at a computer, with a Landasoft program running and lists of names and tags: “Goes out at night,” “Overseas phone,” “unemployed.” One button stood out: “Push Alert.”
The woman clicked it, and the screen filled with names. These people, the woman explained, would be detained and interrogated for suspected ties to terrorism. Sidik’s eyes widened.
“I hated her for what she was doing,” Sidik said. “I knew those people would disappear.”
Xinjiang officials issued arrest quotas, Sidik and five other former officers and administrators said. Sidik watched with horror as the number of people who attended her compound’s weekly mandatory flag-raising ceremony shrank, from 400 to just over 100, as residents were arrested.
At the district office, she observed the logos popping up on screens: Oracle,Microsoft, Intel. The AP found evidence of products from all three companies used in Xinjiang’s policing and data systems during the crackdown, along withEsri, Seagate, Western Digital, Nvidia,Thermo Fisher, andVMWare, then owned by Dell, which advertised cooperation with Xinjiang authorities on its website.
Sidik asked her neighborhood official where it all came from.
“We’ve spent a lot of money to import foreign technology,” she recalls the official telling her.
Among those caught in the digital dragnet was Parida Qabylqai, an ethnic Kazakh pharmacist at a military hospital in Xinjiang.
In February 2018, Qabylqai was flagged by the IJOP for visiting her parents in Kazakhstan. At first, her boss thought it was a mistake.
“You’re a good person, you shouldn’t be listed,” she recalled him saying. Then he checked the IJOP and spotted her name.
“It’s really serious! You’re going to end up in the camps,” he blurted out in shock.
An officer pressed a confession into her hands.
“What did I do wrong?” Qabylqai asked.
“Just sign!” the officer shouted.
Qabylqai was cuffed, hooded, and whisked to a camp, where cameras watched her day and night, even peering at her naked body in the toilet. Guards barking over speakers ordered her not to speak or even to move.
“They did things to us that no human being should ever have to experience,” she said. “But they said my name was listed by the IJOP, so they didn’t need to explain anything.”
Even enforcers of the system weren’t spared.
In 2018, Liu Yuliang, a civil servant in Xinjiang, was ordered to the home of a young police officer in his village. He and dozens of others stood, silent, as the officer embraced his sobbing, pregnant wife.
The officer had forced many people into the camps. Then he himself was flagged for detention.
Too fearful to resist, Liu went along with the arrest, just as the young officer had done before him.
Landasoft software alerted police when flagged people did anything labeled suspicious, like going out at night or logging on the internet repeatedly.Liu was sent to knock on doors, questioning residentswhose “eyes filled with fear.”
As police swept Xinjiang, Landasoft purchased software from Pivotal, a cloud company later acquired by Broadcom, emails show. And Landasoft registered accounts on both Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in 2018, seeking to expand cloud offerings to police clients, emails show.
AWS said Landasoft “consumed very limited cloud services for a brief period” and not for software in the Xinjiang crackdown. Microsoft said Landasoft used Azure services through a self-service portal retired in 2021, and that any Landasoft data was deleted.
The Xinjiang government told the AP: “There is absolutely no such thing as ‘large-scale human rights violations.’”
Liu eventually resigned and returned to his hometown in eastern China, trying to forget what he had seen and done. But he noted with unease the new cameras and checkpoints being installed around his home.
Four days later, state security called and summoned him for questioning. The all-seeing surveillance apparatus had followed him home.
“The Xinjiang model is being copied everywhere, in every city in China,” Liu said.
In 2024, Liu left China, ignoring an airport officer who warned that wherever he went, he would be watched.
“This technology has no emotions,” Liu said. “But in the hands of a government that doesn’t respect the law, it becomes a tool for evil.”

The Yangs are still trapped by U.S. technology.IBM, Dell, HP, Cisco,andSeagateservers, switches and drives power police systems targeting them, maintenance contracts dating to this year show.IntelandNvidia chipsprocess data.Oracle and VMWare softwarerun the database.
But the harder the Yangs push, the harder the system pushes back.
In February 2023, they went to the National Public Complaints Administration in Beijing with a letter. Two days later, police grabbed them from their hotel and drove them home.
The Yangs persisted, trying to plead their case to Beijing. In the following months, they were seized at bus and train stations, beaten at a hospital and abducted by ambulance.

Last July, Yang’s mother tried again. She carried a letter for Chinese leader Xi Jinping:
“They’re using violence and kidnapping to bar me from petitioning and seeking medical treatment ... We beg you, General Secretary, to save us.”
Outside Beijing’s leadership compound, burly men in black tackled Yang’s mother to the ground. She was jailed for over a month, questioned, strip-searched, force-fed medication and deprived of food and water. In October, she and Yang’s sister disappeared.

The Yangs’ house is now the last left standing. The father lives alone.
His relatives have cut contact, unnerved by the flock of police that tail him. Thousands of pages of documents stashed in drawers, stuffed in bags, and piled in boxes in a bathtub chronicle every step of their 16-year quest for justice.
In April, Yang was sent criminal charges showing how much police had spent to stop the family’s “abnormal petitioning.”
The cost: About $37,000.

Health officials are urging customers to throw out any of the affected meals they may still have in their possession.
Metabolic Meals is reaching out directly to customers who purchased the contaminated products to notify them of the outbreak.
Salmonella symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps and fever, according to the CDC. In some cases, symptoms may also include headache, nausea and vomiting.
Health officials said symptoms may start just hours after eating contaminated foods and typically last as long as 7 days. The young, the old and the immunocompromised are at risk of more severe symptoms, which may require hospitalization.

BANGKOK (AP) — Former Thai Prime MinisterThaksin Shinawatrawas taken to Bangkok’s Klong Prem Central Prison on Tuesday after the Supreme Court said he must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions related to graft and abuse of power charges.
The court’s decision came after a hearing to decide whether officials had mishandled his return to Thailand in 2023 to begin serving the sentences.
A judge said that the enforcement of Thaksin’s penalty was not done properly, and therefore his detention in a police hospital did not count as serving prison time.
Following his return to Thailand aftermore than a decade of living in self-exile, Thaksin was sent to a suite at Bangkok’sPolice General Hospitalin the middle of the night, reportedly for medical reasons, after spending less than a day in prison. His eight-year sentence was then commuted to one year by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and he was released on parole after six months in the hospital.
The circumstances raised questions about whether he receivedspecial treatmentand many were suspicious whether he was genuinely ill.
The court’s statement Tuesday said evidence showed that Thaksin’s condition on that night was treatable by the prison’s hospital, but that he was instead sent directly to the police hospital without first being assessed by prison doctors, which was a violation of procedures.
It said that the police hospital’s request for an extension of his stay claimed that Thaksin needed urgent neck surgery, but a record showed that he received surgeries for a locked finger joint and tendonitis in his right shoulder, which were not serious conditions and not what originally sent him to the hospital. The court added Thaksin did not end up having neck surgery before his release.

It also said that Thaksin was believed to have intervened in the treatment procedures to avoid having to go back to the prison, and that he falsely claimed having a health condition in order to be sent to the hospital.
After Tuesday’s court hearing, Thaksin was sent to the Bangkok Remand Prison. The Department of Corrections said in a statement late Tuesday that he was processed and then moved to the nearby Klong Prem Central Prison, which detains prisoners who have received final convictions. He was filmed being taken into a prison van while wearing a blue prisoner uniform.
A message on his Facebook page, shared by his team shortly after the ruling, said that he accepted the court’s decision.
“I’d like to look into the future, to give conclusions to everything, whether the legal proceedings or the conflicts that were caused by or related to me,” read the post. “From today, although I’m without freedom, I still have freedom of thought for the benefit of the country and its people.”
Before the ruling, Thaksin arrived at the court with his family, including two of his children, Pintongta Shinawatra, andformer Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was removed from her position last month after a court found her guilty of an ethics violation fora politically compromising phone callwith Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen.
Paetongtarn spoke to reporters after the ruling, thanking the king for commuting Thaksin’s sentence. She said Thaksin would remain a spiritual leader in Thai politics and that he always thinks about working for the good of the country and Thai people.
“I’m worried about my father, but I’m also proud that he has created so many historic moments for the country,” she said. “It’s quite tough, but of course we are still in a good spirit, both my father and our family.”
Thaksin was prime minister from 2001 until a military coup ousted him in 2006 while he was abroad.
His ouster triggered nearly two decades of deep political polarization, pitting his supporters against opponents including better-off urban dwellers, ardent royalists and the military. He briefly returned in 2008 to face charges but skipped bail and fled abroad again, commencing a self-imposed exile lasting over a decade.
After leaving office, he faced a barrage of lawsuits and criminal charges he claimed were politically motivated.
Last month, a criminal court acquitted him ofroyal defamation, an offense also known as lese-majeste, which could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.times.co.nz/news/breaking-tom-phillips-missing-children-found-alive/,t3_1nbg42q,BREAKING - Tom Phillips' missing children found alive,Tisarwat,2025-09-08 06:14:39,7193,222,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Police have this afternoon, September 8, announced the two missing children of wanted Marokopa man Tom Phillips have been located and are safe and well.
Police Deputy Commissioner Jill Rogers told news media that one of Phillips’ children assisted police in the search for their two siblings.
The events of today began unfolding in Waikato this morning after a man was shot dead by police and a police officer was injured following an alleged burglary.
The area the incident happened in is near the location police have been searching for Phillips, who had been hiding from the authorities with his three children since December, 2021.
In a statement, Waikato Police said: “One man has died and a police officer has been seriously injured after an incident in Waikato overnight.
“Police were called at about 2.30am to a Waitomo address after reports of a burglary at a commercial property.
“During the response, a man and a police officer were shot.
“The man was provided immediate first aid, however died at the scene. The officer was taken to hospital, where he remains in a serious condition.
“A significant police operation is under way. Police ask media and members of the public to respect the police operation and cordons that are now in place to ensure nobody is put at risk.”
News media are reporting Phillips is suspected of carrying out the alleged ram-raid of the PGG Wrightson store in Piopio.
Rogers earlier said that just after 2.30am police received a call from a member of the public who said they believed they were witnessing a burglary in progress.
Two people were seen riding on a quad bike. At about 3.20am, police laid road spikes at an intersection, she said.
The quad bike went over the road spikes and came to a stop. A police officer came across the quad bike and was shot at.
The police officer was shot in the head, fell to the ground, and took cover.
A second police officer arrived at the scene and shot the alleged offender, who died at the scene.
The formal identification of the suspect has not yet taken place, but police believe he is Tom Phillips.
The injured police officer was flown to Waikato Hospital by helicopter. The officer received critical injuries.
Police have been in touch with Phillips’ family and they are providing the family with support.
The incident this morning was “deeply traumatic” for those involved.
The second person found at the scene is a child and they are being cared for, Rogers says.
The child was not injured. Police found multiple firearms at the scene and the officer who was injured was shot with a high-powered rifle.
Police provided the following statement about the alleged ram-raid this morning: “At about 2.30am today, police were called by a member of the public to a burglary at a commercial address in Piopio.
“The caller described two people breaking into a supply store – a male figure wearing a head torch and farm gear, and a shorter person, also wearing a head torch.
“After loading a quad bike with items, they left at about 2.45am and travelled north.
“Based on the descriptions provided, police believed the man was likely to be Tom Phillips, resulting in additional staff, and the police Eagle helicopter, being deployed.
“Responding police set spikes at the intersection of Te Anga and Waipuna Rds, about 3.20am.
“Several minutes later, the quad bike ran over the spikes, and came to a stop shortly after.
“The man fired multiple shots at the first attending police officer as he exited his vehicle at the scene, striking him in the head and shoulder.
“A second police unit was immediately on the scene. Police fired at the armed man, incapacitating him. Police provided first aid, however the offender died at the scene.
“A second person was detained at the scene, where multiple firearms were recovered by police, on and around the quad bike.
“The injured officer was airlifted to hospital about 4.50am.”
Earlier today, before Phillips’ two other missing children were found, police said: “A significant police presence is ongoing in Marokopa and urgent enquiries are being made to locate Phillips’ other children, whom we hold serious concerns for.
“The child at the scene is being provided wraparound support and we will not be providing comment on their location at this early time.
“Following the incident, we have been in contact with Phillips’ family and we will be working to provide them with all available support.
“We are also providing support to our staff member who was injured, and other staff at the scene. This has been a confronting and challenging event for them.
“We understand there will be a number of questions about the incident, but at this time, we are limited in the information we can provide.
“A critical incident investigation has been launched and we are now working to establish a complete timeline of events.
“The IPCA has also been notified, as is standard procedure for an incident of this nature.
“Further information will be released when it becomes available.”

A former Alaska Airlines pilotaccused of trying to cut the enginesof a passenger flight in 2023 while riding off-duty in the cockpit pleaded guilty or no contest to all charges against him on Friday, saying in court that he regretted endangering those on board as well as the damage he caused to his former profession.
Joseph Emerson reached the plea agreements because he wanted to take responsibility for his actions and hoped to avoid further time behind bars, said his attorney, Noah Horst.
Emerson was subdued by the flight crew after trying to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on 22 October 2023, while he was riding in an extra seat in the cockpit. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.
He was sentenced in state court to 50 days in jail, with credit for time served, plus five years of probation, despite a presumption that the convictions would bring 16 to 18 months in prison. He is due to be sentenced in November in the federal case; his attorneys will recommend probation, while prosecutors will be able to argue for a sentence of up to one year in custody.
Emerson told Cheryl Albrecht, the Multnomah county circuit court judge, that he recognized he had caused harm not only to those on board, but to society at large by reducing confidence in air travel and to the airline professionals who perform excellent work every day.
“It should not have happened, and I bear the responsibility for that,” he said.
Emerson told police he was despondent over a friend’s recent death, had takenpsychedelic mushroomsabout two days earlier, and hadn’t slept in more than 40 hours. He has said hebelieved he was dreamingat the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane’s fire-suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.
The airline has said that other members of the flight crew had not observed signs of impairment that would have barred Emerson from the cockpit.
A passenger on the flight, Alison Snyder, told the court the “consequences proposed today seem insufficient relative to Mr Emerson’s choices and actions, regardless of his explanations or circumstances”.
“Mr Emerson knew he was not fit to fly, a requirement for sitting in the cockpit,” Snyder said. “Joseph Emerson’s behavior that day showed he lacks the judgment to be a pilot and should never be allowed anywhere near a flight deck ever again.”
In court on Friday, Emerson reiterated that he had been unable to perceive reality for an extended period after taking the mushrooms, but “that doesn’t make this right”, he said.
Emerson also said he was grateful to the flight crew for restraining him and saving his life, along with those of everyone else on board. He called it “the greatest gift I ever got”, even though he lost his career and wound up in jail, because it made him confront his mental health challenges and reliance on alcohol.
“This difficult journey has made me a better father, a better husband, a better member of my community,” he said. “Today I get to be the dad I was incapable of when I had to use alcohol to deal with life as life is.”
Emerson, of Pleasant Hill,California, was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft.
He previously pleaded not guilty to all the charges, and in December 2023 he was released from custody pending trial, with requirements that he undergo mental health services, stay off drugs and alcohol, and keep away from aircraft.
On Friday, Emerson pleaded guilty to the federal count and no contest to the state charges, which carries the same legal effect as a guilty plea.
The conditions of the state agreement include five years of probation, 664 hours of community service – eight hours for each person he endangered – and $60,569 in restitution, nearly all of it to Alaska Air Group, Horst said.
Half of his community service can be performed at a pilot health non-profit Emerson founded after his arrest. He must also undergo assessments for drug and alcohol and mental health treatment, refrain from using any non-prescribed drugs, and keep at least 25ft (7.6 meters) away from operable aircraft unless he has permission from his probation officer."

A 14-year-old boy who has been homeschooled since the Covid pandemic will be going to university in late September after he aced his A-levels four years early.
Elias, from Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, will be studying biomedical engineering at Imperial College London after getting four A*s and an A in his exams.
The young high-flyer and his equally-talented little sister Ariel, 11, have been tutored by their older siblings Clara and Juliana, who are both students at Imperial.
Elias, who also got a grade 9 in GCSE English, said he was ""very satisfied"" with his results and could not wait to get started at university.
He said: ""I'm pretty excited and I'm also slightly nervous as well but I'm looking forward to it, extremely.
""My sisters can also help because they go to Imperial as well so it'll be quite fun since I'm going with my other siblings.""
Elias and Ariel, pictured with sisters Ella, Clara and Juliana (L-R), scored top grades in their exams
Elias achieved three of his A*s â in chemistry, maths and physics â last year, while he scored an A* in further maths and A in biology this year.
He said he was ""very grateful"" to his sisters and the rest of his family for their support, adding: ""They helped me out a lot, definitely, throughout my whole education journey.""
Meanwhile, Ariel received 9s in GCSE maths and chemistry last year before following those up with 9s in further maths and physics, along with an 8 in biology, this year.
She was a year younger than Elias was when he took his GCSEs and she has already started studying A-levels in maths, biology, chemistry and physics.
""I feel so happy that I got 9s last year for maths and chemistry, even though I started one year earlier than my brother,"" she said.
Both Elias and Ariel said they were very proud of each other, with the latter saying: ""If he can do that [get into university] I feel like I can also achieve the same.""
Ariel has already started studying her A-levels after getting top marks in her GCSEs
Clara, who is due to start a PhD in chemical engineering at Imperial, said she and Juliana, also a PhD student at the same university, would be accompanying Elias to his classes and had made preparations with the staff.
She said they initially had not planned to continue home-schooling their younger siblings, having started with just one or two subjects, but they ""accelerated"" Elias and Ariel's studies when they saw the progress they were making.
Clara and Juliana ensured their younger siblings' days of home-schooling were balanced, allowing time for breaks and fun activities like board games or sport.
""We're definitely all really proud of them because we did this all within a short timeframe,"" she added.
The sisters were hoping to tutor other children part-time during their own studies as they wanted to be ""open to help others"".
""We want to give hope to other talented students, that they can be home-schooled and expand their dreams,"" Clara said.

For more than two decades, the nonprofit APOPO has worked in Tanzania to train African giant pouched rats for lifesaving missions. With one of the best senses of smell in the animal kingdom, these rats can sniff out landmines, trafficked wildlife, disaster survivors and even detect tuberculosis.

MOROGORO, Tanzania (AP) — A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches:a ratwith a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.
Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro inTanzania’sUluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.
“Their sense of smell is incredible,” said Fabrizio Dell’Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. “These rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis — even tiny amounts of the bacteria — and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.”
In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled withland minesas part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angolaor Cambodia, where APOPO hashelped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.
From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these “hero rats” have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.
For decades APOPO has trained these “hero rats,” which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.
The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).
It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell’Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.
While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world’s most effective detectors oftuberculosis.
“Every day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,” said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. “It’s more spectacular to be on the minefield … but for TB … in terms of social impact, it’s tremendous.”
Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. TheWorld Health Organizationsaid last October in its most recent TB report thatthe disease had resurgedas the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.
In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.
APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania,EthiopiaandMozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.
With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.
False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.
“The benefits of using rats are significant,” said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. “They help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.”
TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.
While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.
“Human error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,” said Stanesloaus. “Using rats is a very effective initiative.”
APOPO’s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program’s inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.
Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.
The more existential challenge for these “hero rats” comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.
APOPO’s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO’s labs before treatment can be administered.
“It’s a big challenge,” said Cox. “Not being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB … never reaches us.”
Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.
Regulators may also challenge APOPO’s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.
APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.
Cox defends this approach.
“Our choice was to go for that last patient out there — to go for the social impact,” said Cox.

WASHINGTON, D.C.-The West Virginia National Guard (WVNG) has been directed by Governor Patrick Morrisey to support President Trump’s federal takeover by deploying troops to Washington, D.C., at the request of the Trump administration.
What we know:
Under the command of Maj. Gen. Jim Seward, the WVNG will deploy 300-400 skilled personnel, along with mission-essential equipment and specialized training, to the nation’s capital. The mission will be funded at the federal level.
The deployment comes as President Trump has moved to expand federal authority in the District. The President's plan includes extending federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department and directing the clearing of homeless encampments. The move has led to growing concerns among city officials and residents about the loss of D.C.'s local autonomy.
Governor Morrisey said, ""West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital."" He added that the mission ""reflects our shared commitment to a strong and secure America.""
Maj. Gen. Seward echoed the sentiment, stating, ""We stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region and contribute to the collective effort of making our nation’s capital a clean and safe environment.""

The federal government commissioned the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme to test the ways Australia could enforce the ban, and its final report was published on Sunday.
It looked at a variety of methods - including formal verification using government documents, parental approval, or technologies to determine age based on facial structure, gestures, or behaviours - and found all were technically possible.
""But we did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments,"" it said.
Verification using identity documents was cited as the most accurate method, but the report identified concerns that platforms may keep this data longer than required and was anticipating sharing it with regulators, both of which would leave users' privacy at risk.
Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.
Facial assessment technology was 92% accurate for people aged 18 or over, but there is a ""buffer zone"" - about two to three years either side of 16 - in which is it is less accurate. The report said this would lead to false positives, clearing children for accounts, and false negatives, barring users who should be allowed.
There are also privacy and accuracy concerns with parental approval methods, it said.
It recommended that the methods should be ""layered"" to create the most robust system, and highlighted that many of the technology providers were looking at ways to address circumvention, through things like document forgeries and VPNs (virtual private networks) which obscure the user's country.
Communications Minister Anika Wells said there was ""no one-size-fits-all solution"", that the report showed age checks could be ""private, efficient and effective"".
""These are some of the world's richest companies. They are at the forefront of AI. They use the data that we give them for a bevy of commercial purposes. I think it is reasonable to ask them to use that same data and tech to keep kids safe online,"" she told reporters on Monday.
""There is no excuse for social media platforms not to have a combination of age assurance methods in their platforms ready for 10 December.""
Under the ban, tech companies can fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take ""reasonable steps"" to bar those aged under 16 from holding accounts. These steps are still to be defined.
Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube are among the platforms affected.
Polling indicates most Australian adults support banning social media for children under 16.
However some mental health advocates say the policy has the potential to cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push children under 16 to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.
They suggest the government should instead focus on better policing of harmful content on social media platforms and preparing children for the reality of life on the web.
Wildlife experts say Mike Holston's actions in Far North Queensland were dangerous and cruel.
Thousands of koalas have died from the disease, with some estimates suggesting only 50,000 remain in the wild.
England have yet to decide on the 11 players who will play in the first Ashes Test against Australia, says coach Brendon McCullum.
As Erin Patterson was sentenced, her sole surviving victim Ian Wilkinson called for privacy and kindness.
She will serve a non-parole period of 33 years for killing three relatives and trying to kill another.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.keranews.org/criminal-justice/2025-09-03/tarrant-county-sheriffs-office-body-cameras,t3_1n84b41,Tarrant County TX sheriff refuses to give briefings requested by Commissioner Simmons on jail deaths,apache_spork,2025-09-04 08:12:00,5984,176,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn told county commissioners Wednesday he would not participate in any more briefings about deaths in jail custody called by County Commissioner Alisa Simmons. He let them know through an email, which was read aloud by another county staff member.
Simmons is a frequent critic of the jail, and alongsidesome community members,she has called on Waybourn to resign over his handling of deaths in custody. She requests briefings about jail issues at Tarrant County Commissioners Court meetings, some of which Waybournhas attended, andsome of which he hasn’t.
No one from the sheriff’s office showed up for the briefing called during the last commissioners court meeting. Simmons called it again for Wednesday’s meeting, and again, no one showed. Waybourn sent an email explaining his absence, which County Administrator Chandler Merritt read to commissioners.
""The repeated lack of civility displayed by the Precinct 2 commissioner towards Tarrant County staff is both hostile and unprofessional,” Merritt read. “I will not subject anyone from this office to that type of inappropriate treatment. Therefore, no one from this agency will participate in briefings requested by the Precinct 2 commissioner before this court.”
The sheriff’s office already sends out press releases about each death, Waybourn wrote in the email. If Simmons, journalists or members of the public have questions about jail deaths, they can submit a public records request, he said.
The briefings are for the public, not herself, Simmons said.
“If you don’t want your staff to come down here and take questions, that’s your responsibility in the first place. I didn’t ask you to send staff, I asked you to come down here,” she said. “And where are you? Big tall guy, big hat, guns, everything, and you can’t take questions from the citizenry? Your constituents?”
More than 70 people have died in jail custody since Waybourn took office in 2017, a number that has led to public outcry. Waybournhas defended his jail,arguing there will always be some deaths in custody — there's nothing he can do about someone who gets booked into jail already suffering from a terminal condition. He has also insisted jailers who do wrong face consequences.
Some deaths have raised suspicion and even led to criminal charges. Two jailers are awaiting trial for murder for the death ofAnthony Johnson Jr.last year.
Johnson Jr. died of asphyxiation after jailers pepper sprayed him, and one knelt on his back for more than a minute.
The county has paid outmore than $4.3 million in lawsuitsrelated to deaths and allegations of mistreatment in the jail. That includes the biggest lawsuit settlement in county history:$1.2 million to Chasity Congious, a woman who gave birth unattended in her cell in 2020. Her daughter died shortly after.
Other lawsuits have been dismissed. A judgespared Tarrant County from a lawsuitover Johnson’s death, ruling that the county’s policy and procedures did not lead to Johnson’s death.
The same judge also dismissed a lawsuit over the fentanyl overdose death of Trelynn Wormley, saying once again the lawsuitfailed to prove there was a systemic problem— in this case, letting drugs inside the jail.
In 2025, the sheriff’s office has reported five in-custody deaths. That includesKimberly Phillips, who died of starvation and dehydration, andCharles Stephen Johnson, who died by suicide.

The Air Force has offered full military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, the rioter who was fatally shot by police as she stormed the U.S. Capitol during theJan. 6 riot four years ago, officials said Thursday.
Babbitt, 35, was an Air Force veteran who went to Washington to protest Donald Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election, her family has said, and was among the rioters seeking to break into the House chamber.
And as Babbitt tried to climb through a broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker's Lobby, U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd fired one shot, killing her.
Although Byrd was cleared of wrongdoing by theJustice DepartmentandCapitol Police,Babbitt's death has remained a right-wing rallying cry that has cast her as a martyr.
""After reviewing the circumstances ofSrABabbitt’s death, the Air Force has offered Military Funeral Honors to SrA Babbitt’s family,” an Air Force spokesperson said.
The conservative legal group Judicial Watch had long been pushing for Babbitt to receive full military funeral honors and pushed the narrative that she was a victim of government misconduct.
""Ashli Babbitt’s patriotic and courageous service in the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard also merits favorable action on this request,"" the group wrote in a post Wednesdayannouncing the Air Force's decision.
Babbitt was a prolific social media user who embraced conspiracy theories.
Shebelieved in ""pizzagate,"" a viral disinformation campaign that falsely alleged that a child abuse ring was being operated by Democrats from a Washington pizza restaurant, andembraced QAnon,the convoluted conspiracy movement baselessly claiming — among other things — that Trump was secretly fighting an international cabal of criminals and pedophiles.
Babbitt's estatefiled a wrongful death lawsuitagainst the U.S. government in early 2024. Then, after Trump won the White House in November, his administration reacheda $5 milliondeal to settle the civil complaint.
A representative for Babbitt's family could not be immediately reached for comment Thursday.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/29/spirit-airlines-chapter-11-bankruptcy.html,t3_1n3j7a4,Spirit Airlines files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in a year,Panaka,2025-08-29 21:03:51,3141,182,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Spirit Airlineson Friday filed for bankruptcy protection for the second time in a year, just months after the country's largest budget carrier failed find to sturdy financial footing when it came out of Chapter 11 protection in March.
Spirit debtholders agreed in the airline's previousbankruptcyto exchange $795 million in debt for equity, but the carrieravoided bigger changesto cut costs, like getting rid of planes or more dramatically shrinking its footprint.
Spirit now says it will reduce its network and shrink its fleet, cuts that it said will reduce costs by ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" a year.
""Since emerging from our previous restructuring, which was targeted exclusively on reducing Spirit's funded debt and raising equity capital, it has become clear that there is much more work to be done and many more tools are available to best position Spirit for the future,"" Spirit CEO Dave Davis said in a news release on Friday.
In its filing, Spirit listed its assets and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion.
The carrier sought to reassure customers that they can continue to book and fly on Spirit after its bankruptcy filing.
""Virtually every major U.S. airline has used these tools to improve their businesses and position them for long-term success,"" Spirit posted on itsInstagram accounton Friday, written in white against a black background, uncharacteristic for the carrier that is often featuring its bright-yellow planes and tropical beaches.
Spirit, known for its bright yellow planes, had expected to come out stronger from its previous bankruptcy, which it entered in November and emerged from in March. But the airline was dragged down by continued high costs and weaker U.S. domestic travel demand.
In a court filing in December, Spirit had forecast a net profit of $252 million this year. Butearlier this month, it said it instead lost nearly $257 million since March 13, after it exited Chapter 11, through the end of June.
Spirit warned a few weeks ago that it might not be able tosurvive a yearunless it significantly increased its cash. It also said its credit card processor was seeking additional collateral. It then borrowed the entire $275 million available under its revolving credit facility and said that the card processor could hold back up to $3 million a day from the airline.
Spirit's shares are down 72% over the past month and down 45% in after-hours trading on Friday.
Labor unions warned pilots and flight attendants earlier this month that more changes could be ahead. Hundreds of flight attendants are already on voluntary leave, and Spirit has planned to furloughhundreds of pilotsthis year to cut costs.
""This bankruptcy will be harder and look different than last year, but we will keep you closely informed and stick together as we move forward,"" the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA told the carrier's flight attendants on Friday after Spirit's filing.
It said it expects more leaves will be offered. ""As we communicated a few weeks ago, we urge you to take an honest look at your personal situation, examine all your options, and prepare for all possible scenarios,"" the union said.
Spirit had struggled for years as it dealt with a glut of U.S. flights, a Pratt & Whitney engine recall and a failed takeover byJetBlue Airways, a deal that was blocked in court.
Spirit's aircraft lessors had reached out to rival airlines in recent weeks to gauge executives' interest in some of the carrier's planes, according to people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. Spirit said Friday that it has been ""actively engaged"" with its biggest lessors, debtholders and others to ""refine its path forward.""
The carrier is the United States' largest budget airline, followed closely by rivalFrontier Airlines, which has tried and failed to merge with Spirit repeatedly since 2022.
Frontier on Tuesday announced20 new routesthat compete with Spirit to win over its struggling competitor's customers.
Spirit has been an icon of budget travel and its bare-bones service — and fees for bags and everything else — became afavorite punchlinefor comedians.
Over the years, larger airlines likeAmericanandUnitedrolled out their own basic fares for price-sensitive customers, but with more perks on board like snacks and big global networks where loyalty members could use their miles for more destinations.
Another challenge was that many travelers, especially post-pandemic, have sought out pricier and more spacious seats on board, as well as more international travel. Spirit has tried to rebrand to bundle fares and provide more premium seating options, though competitors have still said they have an advantage in part because they have bigger networks and more brand loyalty.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/29/kash-patel-girlfriend-fbi-defamation-lawsuit.html,t3_1n3eoj6,FBI director Kash Patel's girlfriend sues ex-agent for defamation over Israeli spy claim,NewSlinger,2025-08-29 18:05:57,4108,189,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Alexis Wilkins, the longtime girlfriend ofFBIDirectorKash Patel, is suing an ex-agent and self-described whistleblower for defamation, alleging he called her a formerIsraelispy whose relationship with Patel is a ""honeypot"" operation.
The defendant, Kyle Seraphin, ""has maliciously lied"" about Wilkins by ""falsely asserting that she—an American-born country singer—is an agent of a foreign government, assigned to manipulate and compromise the Director of the FBI,"" Wilkins' attorneywrote in the lawsuitfiled Wednesday in federal court in Austin, Texas.
Wilkins accuses Seraphin, a conservative podcaster who calls himself a ""recovering FBI agent,"" of ""using this fabricated story as self-enriching clickbait.""
Wilkins is seeking at least $5 million in damages. The suit was first reported byReasonand highlighted Friday morning byCourt Watch.
Her legal complaint homes in on Seraphin's comments on ""The Kyle Seraphin Show"" on Aug. 22.
Patel ""has had his own little 'honeypot' issue that's been going on of late, so we're just going to acknowledge it real publicly,"" Seraphin said on the episode at the center of the lawsuit.
""He's got a girlfriend that is half his age, who is apparently is both a country music singer, a political commentator on Rumble, a friend of John Rich through [FBI deputy Director Dan] Bongino, who also now owns a big chunk of Rumble, and she's also a former Mossad agent in what is like the equivalent of their NSA.""
""But I'm sure that's totally because, like, she's really looking for like a cross-eyed, you know, kind of thickish built, super cool bro who's almost 50 years old who's Indian in America,"" Seraphin said sarcastically.
""Like it has nothing to do with the fact that uh we're really close to the Trump administration,"" he said. ""Anyway, I'm sure that's totally just like love. That's what real love looks like.""
Seraphin did not identify Wilkins by name, but her suit says his statement is ""obviously about her specifically.""
Wilkins, 26, said her long-term relationship with Patel, 45, began in January 2023 and has been public knowledge. Patel was confirmed as FBI director in February.
Seraphin, discussing the lawsuit at lengthon his showon Friday morning, noted that similar claims about Wilkins have previously surfaced in social media posts that have generated significantly more attention than his comments did.
By calling her a honeypot, Seraphin is suggesting that Wilkins is ""an agent of a foreign government who began a relationship with another for purposes of manipulating and compromising them,"" the lawsuit says.
""He is accusing Ms. Wilkins of being a spy for a foreign government, conducting espionage to undermine our national security and/or to manipulate federal law enforcement at the highest level, and even committing treason,"" her lawyer wrote.
""Ms. Wilkins is not even Jewish, much less Israeli, and has never set foot in Israel ... The notion that her relationship with Dir. Patel is part of some plot against her country is vile and ridiculous.""
Seraphin, on his show, said he never made those claims.
The suit argues that since Seraphin ""trades on his experience"" as a former FBI counterterrorism agent, he cannot claim that he comments were mere hyperbole.
It also notes that Seraphin met with both Patel and Wilkins ""at a conservative political event roughly two years ago,"" before he was confirmed as FBI director.
Seraphin said on his show Friday morning that he had no recollection of having met them.
NBC News reportedin January that Patel had reached out to Seraphin and two other conservative former special agents prior to being nominated to lead the FBI.
Patel ""keeps tabs on me and the guys that he's helped out, and also we share information about FBI stuff,"" Seraphin told NBC at the time.

NEW YORK --A doctor who sexually abused sedated patients at a New York City hospital and raped women who were unconscious at his home has been sentenced to 24 years in prison.
Zhi Alan Cheng admitted abusing seven women, including three female patients he was treating at New York-Presbyterian Queens hospital, the Queens district attorney’s office said. He had pleaded guilty in June to four counts of rape and three counts of sexual abuse and was sentenced Thursday.
Prosecutors also alleged Cheng abused an eighth woman who was a patient at the hospital. He entered an Alford plea on that charge, meaning that he did not admit guilt but acknowledged that prosecutors have enough evidence to convict.
Most of the victims had no memory of the abuse and were sedated. One of the women woke up in the middle of an assault after she had been sedated for a gastrointestinal procedure, prosecutors said.
Cheng, 35,was arrestedin 2022 after a female acquaintance discovered a video of him abusing her at his home while she was passed out. Searches of his home and devices uncovered video evidence of the doctor abusing women at his home and workplace, according to prosecutors. They also discovered liquid anesthesia.
Cheng has been barred from practicing medicine. Prosecutors have said that New York-Presbyterian officials cooperated in the criminal investigation.

At a news conference on Wednesday afternoon in Regina, Insp. Ashley St. Germaine said RCMP executed a search warrant at a privately owned decommissioned school in Richmound at around 4:30 a.m CST.
Didulo and her followers have been living for two years in the village of approximately 118 people, located 365 kilometres west of Regina, near the Alberta border.
St. Germaine said RCMP got a report on Aug. 25 of one of the building's occupants possessing a firearm. That led to the investigation that culminated in the raid.
""A team of skilled and experienced senior officers was established to oversee this large and complex operation,"" she said.
More than 30 police vehicles from multiple jurisdictions, including two tactical vehicles, were at the scene, St. Germaine said.
A livestream video, posted by Didulo to her followers on Telegram at 5:51 a.m. CST on Wednesday, captured the moment when two officers wearing tactical gear burst into a room where Didulo was standing.
""Leave the phone down. You're under arrest,"" one officer says in the video.
Didulo surrenders to officers and the camera is pointed at the floor for a few minutes. Voices off camera then remark that the phone is livestreaming before the video ends.
'Queen of Canada' livestreams her own arrest as RCMP deploy to cult headquarters in Sask.
St. Germaine said all 16 arrests had been made by 6 a.m. CST.
The investigation is in its early stages, St. Germaine said, with investigators still searching the building and interviewing the arrested. She said the identities of all the people and their connections to Didulo had not yet been confirmed.
""At this time, no charges have been laid,"" St. Germaine said.
Richmound's village council declined to comment, deferring to RCMP.
Vanessa Johnson, a resident of Richmound, said the raid came as a surprise.
""We didn't really know that anything was going to happen,"" Johnson said.
Johnson said she was flooded with calls about the news and went to go witness the event. She said the RCMP's report about replica guns doesn't surprise her.
""One of the cult leaders was walking up and down my street, which is quite a bit,"" she said. ""They really have talked about shooting people bringing boots on the ground.""
Johnson said the news is a huge relief for a small community that has felt frustrated and scared.
""Our spirits are so lifted. I feel so happy,"" Johnson said. ""This is the best day of my life.""
Didulo and her followers have been living in the former school in Richmound for two years.
Christine Sarteschi, a professor at Chatham University who researches and monitors cults, said Didulo's followers believe she is the ""Queen of Canada.""
""[Didulo] tells them that she is the ultimate authority, that she is the ruler under natural law. She is effectively the supreme ruler of all the land. She tells them they don't have to pay taxes,"" Sarteschi said in an interview on Wednesday.
""It's anything Romana says and the followers truly believe what she says.""
The cult began as part of the larger Q-Anon movement — which believes there is a secret cabal running the government — and has now evolved into a sovereign citizen movement, Sarteschi said.
Sovereign citizens, also known as freemen of the land, believe laws don't apply to them.
Didulo's followers also don't believe in vaccination and are convinced their leader has alien powers, Sarteschi said.
""I think that they're attracted to her because she says things that appeal to them,"" Sarteschi said.
Didulo's followers have disrupted local residents since settling in Richmound.
In July, the village office closed its doors to the public outside pre-arranged appointments, citing harassment and intimidation toward staff.
Rick Manz, the owner of the property and one of Didulo's followers, was charged in July with assault, resisting arrest and uttering threats.
Having cult in town like 'living next to dormant volcano,' says Richmound, Sask., resident

Updated on:  August 26, 2025 / 8:05 PM EDT/ CBS News
Less than a week afterunveiling a controversial new logothat prompted the company'sstock value to take a diveand even President Trump to weigh in, Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday that it will return to its old logo.
""We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,"" the popular Southern-themed restaurant chainannouncedin a post to social media. ""We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain.""
Last week, the restaurant chain suddenly announced it was changing its logo to remove the image of a man sitting in a chair leaning against a barrel, and replacing it with a logo that only featured the chain's name.
The Tennessee-based Cracker Barrel, which has more than 650 locations in 44 states, saw a Wall Street revolt of sorts, as it lost a staggering nearly $100 million in market value after releasing the new logo, which was part of an ongoing effort to update its image by adding new menu items and redecorating its stores.
""Rather than just showing one person, we wanted to feature lots of people,"" the company said on its website of the new logo. ""The idea was to celebrate the diversity of all our guests with a logo that represented our continued passion for pleasing people of all races, colors, and genders.""
The move also drew criticism from customers and some conservative commentators, who saw the change as potentially politically motivated. Branding expert Nick Yeonakis told CBS News the original logo was a ""throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.""
""So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,"" he said.
On Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump called on Cracker Barrel to scrap the new logo.
""Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,"" Mr. Trumpwrotein a Truth Social post.
Mr. Trump followed up Tuesday eveningby praisingthe company for returning to the old logo, writing that ""all of your fans very much appreciate it.""
And in apostto X, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich said he spoke by phone with Cracker Barrel executives on Tuesday, who ""thanked President Trump for weighing in on the issue of their iconic 'original' logo. They wanted the President to know that they heard him, along with customer response (the ultimate poll), and would be restoring the 'Old Timer.'""
Cracker Barrel has seen its growth slow in recent years after its business soared in the 1990s. In 2024, it reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.
According to the company, the iconic logowas createdin 1977 on the back of a napkin by a designer named Bill Holley ""with the goal of creating a feeling of nostalgia with an old-timer wearing overalls.""

Intel and the government announcedthe deallate on Friday. Under it, Intel will get $5.7 billion in grants that officials had allocated but not yet paid under former President Biden's CHIPS and Science Act. The government gave Chipzilla an additional $3.2 billion under the Secure Enclave program, which is supposed to be used to develop high-security chips for US government and military use. Intel has already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants so far, giving it quite the war chest.
""It is my Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of Intel, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,"" President Trumpannouncedon his social media site Truth Social.
""I negotiated this Deal with Lip-Bu Tan, the Highly Respected Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for Intel.""
Indeed, Intel's shares closed the day up more than 5%, giving the company a market cap of nearly $110 billion, which would make the US government's stake worth about $11 billion. That said, the government did not pay nothing for the shares, although it used money that had already been allocated under previous programs, so no new money was spent.
Intel has been desperately trying to drum up more funding as it seeks to regain its position as one of the top chipmakers in the world. The cash will give it a much-needed lifeline to rebuild its advanced chip-making capabilities and move production stateside and away from Asian vendors like TSMC.
The deal also represents a personal win for the relatively new CEO, who took overin March. At the start of the month, the president wascalling forTan's resignation as he was ""highly CONFLICTED,"" but after some frantic diplomacy he's now back in the government's good books it seems.
""As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the US, Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world’s most advanced technologies are American made,"" said Tan in a statement.
""President Trump’s focus on U.S. chip manufacturing is driving historic investments in a vital industry that is integral to the country’s economic and national security. We are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance US technology and manufacturing leadership.""
In addition to taking a 10 percent stake, the government reserves the right to buy an additional 5 percent of the company at $20 per share, a considerable discount on the current stock market price of around $25. The government won't have a seat on the board, and has said it will back the current management with ""limited exceptions.""
""Intel is excited to welcome the United States of America as a shareholder, helping to create the most advanced chips in the world,"" said the United States Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. ""As more companies look to invest in America, this administration remains committed to reinforcing our country’s dominance in artificial intelligence while strengthening our national security.""
Rumors about the investment havecirculatedfor a while and, on the face of it, looks like a very good deal for American taxpayers. For decades Intel has spent tens of billions propping up its share price with stock buybacks and returns to investors, while failing to get to grips with advanced chip design and manufacturing.
Under the circumstances just handing them money with nothing to show for it would look like a dumb move. Now the US has a direct stake in a domestic chip company that could prove both lucrative, and also is necessary to ensure the US gets its chips from a friendly supplier in the homeland. ®

An online fundraiser on GoFundMe organized by the NAACP raises money for a Rochester family on May 7, 2025. (AP Photo/Terry Tang, File)
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota prosecutors filed misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges Tuesday against a womanaccused of using a racist sluragainst a Black child at a playground — an incident the woman has since used to raise more than $800,000 after she appealed for help with relocating.
“Defendant wrongfully and unlawfully engaged in offensive, obscene, abusive, boisterous, or noisy conduct, or in offensive, obscene, or abusive language that would reasonably tend to arouse alarm, anger or resentment in others,”the criminal complaint alleges.
A social media video of the April incident, in which the woman admitted to using the slur, has garnered millions of views. It showed a man confronting her for using the slur toward the child. She then appeared to double down on the racist term and held up a middle finger to the man who challenged her.
As of Tuesday, she had raised over $800,000 on the Christian fundraising platform GiveSendGo — including many donations that came in after the charges were announced — with a stated goal of $1 million. In her last update, in June, the woman claimed she was the victim of “silly misinformation.”
“Big things are happening regarding our future,” she wrote. “Life-changing events are at play, and we have all of YOU to thank for that! I won’t go into specifics, but just know that all is well on our end. ... Keep standing up for yourselves, and keep fighting for the First Amendment!”

The woman was charged by summons with three counts of disorderly conduct. Each count carries a maximum potential penalty of 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine, though actual sentences in Minnesota tend to be lighter. Her arraignment was set for Oct. 29.
“This was a situation that deeply affected many people, especially our communities of color, and caused real turmoil in our community,” Mayor Kim Nortonsaid in a statement.“We acknowledge the lasting impact this incident has had, not only on those directly involved and across our community, but also in the broader conversations happening at the state and national level.”
While the complaint lists a Rochester address for the defendant, it wasn’t immediately clear if she was still living there, given her stated intention to relocate. The complaint indicated that police attempts to make contact with her were unsuccessful. Court records said she was representing herself.
Initial reports said the young victim was 5 years old, but the criminal complaint said he was 8. The child’s father told police his son is autistic, and due to his disability, he doesn’t understand typical social boundaries and requires intensive parental supervision. At some point while at the park in Rochester, the child took an applesauce pouch from someone else’s diaper bag, it said.
The father saw this and chased him to try to retrieve the food pouch. The defendant also saw it and chased the child, who climbed on playground equipment to try to get away. She repeatedly called him the racial epithet, the complaint said, and grabbed the food item from him.
A different person, who recorded the confrontation on his phone, asked her why she used the slur. The complaint said she admitted to using it and said she could “if he acts like one.” When pressed, the complaint said, she turned her anger to the witness, called him the same epithet, and when confronted about her “hate speech,” she used expletives to indicate she didn’t care.
“Given the sensitive and complicated nature of this case, along with the high level of public attention, completing the necessary reviews and conversations with the victim’s family took longer than usual,” the office of City Attorney Michael Spindler-Krage said in the statement explaining the lengthy investigation.
The NAACP Rochester chapter started its own fundraising campaign for the child’s family. The GoFundMe page had raised $340,000 when it was closed in May, per the family’s wishes.
The organization has been working with the family to pursue legal action against the woman in the video, said the chapter’s president Walé Elegbede.
“Their child was victimized and traumatized with the racist and hateful rhetoric and actions,” he said. “It’s not just the child; the family was impacted.”
Elegbede commended the city attorney’s office for bringing charges, calling it the “first step” to pursue “justice and accountability”.
“If you have a child and you’re going to the park, you want to enjoy the park,” he said. “And if the child does something, a responsible adult will talk to the child with empathy, not with hate and vitriol. And that’s where she chose to take it. And when she had opportunities, there was no remorse whatsoever.”

In a landmark interview, Brown — who played 94 games for the Eagles between 2007 and 2016 — revealed his sexuality played a “huge” factor in his decision to retire.
“I played in the AFL for 10 years for the West Coast Eagles and I’m a bisexual man,” Brown toldThe Daily Aus.
Brown opened up on the weight that came with hiding his sexuality at the club and homophobia in the AFL, with the hope his decision could make others feel more comfortable coming out.
The public revelation comes against the backdrop of a spate of homophobic incidents in the league. Adelaide’s Izak Rankine was banned for four weeks for using a homophobic slur towards a Collingwood opponent a fortnight ago.
Brown said bisexuality is often misunderstood.
“Your sexuality, or being queer, for a man, only means you’re either gay or you’re not. There’s no in-between,” he said.
“Bisexuality (is believed to be) not a thing, it’s (seen as) made up to cover gay men or straight-presenting gay men.
“There’s a lot of assumptions out there... being a bisexual man can look different and it does look different.”
No AFL player has ever come out as queer before, and former league chief executive Gillon McLachlan told The West Australian’s Leadership Matters event in 2023 there was a “pressure” and a “weight” in being the first.
“I’m in this position strong and comfortable to, as Gil McLachlan says, take the burden. And if someone needed to do it, I’m in the space to do it,” Brown said.
“I don’t believe that this is about me. It’s not about Mitch Brown being the first at all. For me, it’s about sharing my experience so others can feel seen.”
Brown has previously been married to former Australian netballer Shae Brown and is in a current relationship with a female partner.
“In the locker room and in the spas, the chats were all geared around ‘who did everyone pick up on the weekend’? Or, you know, ‘she’s pretty hot’,” he said.
“It was never once an opportunity to speak openly or explore your feelings or questions in a safe way.
“I remember two people have a conversation around how they would feel having a shower next to a gay man and one of the players said ‘I’d rather be in a cage full of lions than have a shower next to a gay man’.
“There’s been so many times in my life that I’ve seen things or heard things and not said anything, in fear of people thinking that I was gay or bisexual.”
Brown said he had been approached around extending his career, but said he wanted to spend time meeting new people and exploring new conversations.
“I got to the end of my career and I was asked to play on for a couple more years and I was over it, I was done.
“One of the biggest reasons I wanted to finish up playing AFL was to meet new people, to meet a diverse range of people, men and women, different cultural backgrounds, and I craved new conversations.

“I craved talking to someone and not being judged. I craved the ability to choose who I wanted to be around rather than fit into a team.”
Brown was drafted by the Eagles with pick 16 in 2006 — weeks after they won the premiership. He battled a series of knee injuries that cruelled his career and played no more than 19 games in any season. He won the Eagles’ best clubman award in 2012.
West Coast responded in a social media post on Wednesday.
“We love you Mitch!” the post read.
“We’re proud of you and how you’re living your values to make footy and our society a better place.”

LGBTIQA+ advocacy group Health Equity Matters have thrown their support behind Brown.
“Today is a historic moment, not just for the AFL, but for our entire nation and for LGBTIQA people across Australia,” chief executive Dash Heath-Paynter said.
“Mitch Brown’s story demonstrates strength and honesty. Speaking openly about his sexuality in the context of elite Australian sport is inspiring and will give confidence to many Australians confronting similar questions of identity.
“For over a century of AFL competition, no male player has identified as openly bisexual or gay. Mitch’s announcement breaks through decades of silence and opens the door for others who may be on their own journey.”

An Italian master painting stolen by the Nazis from a Jewish art dealer in Amsterdam has been spotted on the website of an estate agent selling a house in Argentina, more than 80 years after it was taken.
A photo shows Portrait of a Lady by Giuseppe Ghislandi hanging above a sofa inside a property near Buenos Aires once owned by a senior Nazi official who moved to South America after the Second World War.
The painting,which features on a database of lost wartime art, was traced when the house was put up for sale by the official's daughter, Dutch newspaper AD reports.
The artwork is among hundreds looted from art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, who helped other Jews escape during the war.
Goudstikker died at sea in an accident escaping the Netherlands and is buried in England.
Over 1,100 works from Goudstikker's collection were bought up in a forced sale by senior Nazis after his death, including Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.
Post-war, some of the works were recovered in Germany and put on display in Amsterdam's Rijkmuseum as part of the Dutch national collection. Goudstikker's sole-surviving heir, daughter-in-law Marei von Saher, took possession of 202 pieces in 2006, AD reports.
But one painting, a portrait of the Contessa Colleoni by late-baroque portraitist Giuseppe Ghislandi, remained missing until now.
AD's investigationunearthed wartime documents suggesting it was in the possession of Friedrich Kadgien, an SS officer and senior financial aide to Göring, who fled to Switzerland in 1945 before moving to Brazil then Argentina, where he became a successful businessman.
Kadgien - described as a ""snake of the lowest sort"" by American interrogators  - died in 1979.  A US file seen by AD also said notes on Kadgien included the line ""Appears to possess substantial assets, could still be of value to us"".
The paper said it had made attempts over several years to speak to the late Nazi's two daughters in Buenos Aires about their father and the missing artworks, but to no avail.
But reporters had a stroke of good luck when one of Kadgien's daughters put the home, once owned by her father, up for sale with an estate agent specialising in expensive Argentine property.
""There is no reason to think this could be a copy,"" said Annelies Kool and Perry Schrier of the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands (RCE) who reviewed the images for AD.
Another looted artwork - a floral still-life by the 17th-century Dutch painter Abraham Mignon - was also spotted on one of the sister's social media, AD reports.
All attempts to speak to the sisters since the photo was spotted have failed, according to AD, with one telling the paper:  ""I don't know what information you want from me and I don't know what painting you are talking about.""
Lawyers for Goudstikker's estate said they would make every effort to reclaim the painting.
""My family aims to bring back every single artwork robbed from Jacques' collection, and to restore his legacy,"" von Saher said.

The Trump administration directed 40 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., to remove references to transgender people from their sex education programs or risk losing federal funding.
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services,sent letters Tuesdaydemanding that the health departments in these states and territories remove “all references to gender ideology” from their Personal Responsibility Education Program, or PREP. The program is a federally funded initiative created in 2010 to help prevent teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
“Accountability is coming,” acting Assistant Secretary Andrew Gradison said ina statement.“Federal funds will not be used to poison the minds of the next generation or advance dangerous ideological agendas. The Trump Administration will ensure that PREP reflects the intent of Congress, not the priorities of the left.”
The 40 states that received letters are: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  The five U.S. territories are: Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Links toall 46 letterswere included in the administration’s press statement. The ACF’s four-page letter to New York, for example, includes a bulleted list of course content that was flagged during a “medical accuracy review” earlier this year and “must be removed from New York’s PREP curricula and program materials.”
The content flagged for removal includes definitions of gender identity and gender expression and directives that program facilitators allow students to share their pronouns and “demonstrate acceptance and respect for all participants, regardless of personal characteristics, including race, cultural background, religion, social class, sexual orientation or gender identity,” according to the letter.
If New York’s health department declines to comply, it could lose more than $6 million in federal funds, according todata provided by ACF. The other states and territories stand to lose $300,000 to $4.6 million each.
Cadence Acquaviva, a spokesperson for New York's health department, said in an emailed statement that the department is reviewing the letter.
""The mission of the New York State Department of Health, under the leadership of Governor Kathy Hochul, remains the same,"" Acquaviva said. ""We will continue to promote and protect health and well-being for all, building on a foundation of health equity.”
Jonathan Modie, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority, said it is ""assessing federal changes and actions for any impact that they have on Oregonians.""
""OHA is committed to making sure people in every Oregon community can access the services they need,"" Modie said.
The letters come just days after the ACFterminated $12 million of California’s remainingPREP funding after the state’s health department declined to remove references to trans people from the curriculum, arguing that the references had already been approved by the agency, the materials were medically accurate and relevant to the statute, and ACF does not have the authority to take such an enforcement action, according toACF’s termination letterto the state.
California’s health department has 30 days to appeal.A spokesperson for the department said in a statement that the state maintains its position that its PREP curriculum “is medically accurate, comprehensive, and age-appropriate.”
“CA PREP sexual health education curriculum promotes healthy relationships and reduces the rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy, as well as leads to delayed sexual activity in youth — all outcomes that lead to a healthier state,” the spokesperson said.
In an emailed statement, Elana Ross, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, said, “If it’s a day ending in y, President Trump is attacking kids’ safety, health, and access to education as part of his culture war.”
The action from ACF is part of the Trump administration’s ongoing effort to prohibit federal recognition of trans people and penalize the use of federal funds for any program that includes or mentions them.
In the first few weeks of his presidency, Trump issued executive orders declaring that there areonly two unchangeable sexes;prohibiting trans people from enlisting and serving in the military; barring trans girls and womenfrom competing on female sports teamsin federally funded K-12 schools and colleges; andbarring federal fundingfrom going to hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors. The federal government has taken several actions against providers of transition care,resulting in more than 20 hospitals over the last few months rolling back or endingtheir gender-affirming care programs for minors and some young adults.
Federal officials have also removedmentions of transor intersex people from agency websites, including fromthe websitefor the Stonewall National Monument commemorating the site of the 1969 Stonewall uprising in New York, which is widely considered a turning point in the modern gay rights movement.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Leo, who typically refrains from speaking off the cuff, expressed unusually forceful concern on Tuesday about the consequences of Israel's strike in Qatar.
""There's some really serious news right now: Israel's attack on some Hamas leaders in Qatar,"" the pontiff told journalists outside his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo.
""The entire situation is very serious,"" Leo said. ""We do not know how things will go. It is really serious.""
Leo, the first U.S. pope, has tended to take a diplomatic approach that is more muted than his predecessor, Pope Francis. Leo usually sticks to the Vatican's careful diplomatic language, but has been ramping up criticism of Israel's military campaign in Gaza.
The pope met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog at the Vatican last week, after which the Vatican said Leo had lamented the ""tragic situation in Gaza"" with Herzog.
Leo spoke on Tuesday after news that Israel had launched a strike in Doha, which it said was aimed at top Hamas leaders including Khalil al-Hayya, its exiled Gaza chief and top negotiator.
""We must continue working and insisting on peace,"" the pope told the journalists, who also asked for comments about the situation in Gaza.
Leo also said that he had tried to call the pastor of Gaza's sole Catholic Church, Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, who spoke frequently with Francis.
The Vatican had not previously said whether Leo has spoken personally with Romanelli. The pastor did not respond to a Reuters inquiry earlier this week.
Leo spent the day on Tuesday in Castel Gandolfo, about an hour's drive south of Rome, and was headed back to the Vatican in late afternoon.

According to a source in the Main Intelligence Directorate whospoketoUkrinformon September 8, Ukrainian cyber specialists launched a massive DDoS attack targeting the Russia`s network infrastructure that supports online fuel payments, including the use of fuel cards on the morning of September 7.
The attack disabled the “Advanced Payment Systems” platform, which manages RosPetrol fuel cards, as well as servers belonging to Rostelecom and Lukoil. Intelligence estimates put the financial losses for Russia at between $1 million and $3 million.
That same day, Ukrainian cyber forces struck the infrastructure of Russian telecom operator K-Corp. More than 700 switches and 13 servers in two data centers were taken offline, bringing the company’s operations to a complete standstill, HUR reported.
K-Corp was deliberately targeted because it provides telecommunications services to the Russian defense giant Kalashnikov Concern—directly complicit in the killing of hundreds of Ukrainian civilians, including women and children.
In addition, dozens of Russian online platforms were hacked, with their homepages displaying a message marking Ukraine’s Military Intelligence Day.

Three years have passed since the Saeima adopted amendments to the Immigration Law and obliged Russian citizens living in Latvia to prove their knowledge of the state language. 46% passed the test at A2 level in 2023. The rest were given a two-year deadline, which will expire in the next few months.
At the same time, with the 2024 changes to the Immigration Law, the deadline for 841 Russian citizens to apply has already expired. According to Latvian Television's De Facto programme, the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs (PMLP) has already sent letters notifying them that they have until 13 October to leave Latvia.
Representatives of the Immigration Service of the State Border Guard are the ones who inspect Russian citizens who have not responded to the request of the Latvian Migration Service to submit documents and secure their right to stay in Latvia. Most of the time, Russian citizens without valid documents are not found, as it turns out that they have already left the country. However, if they are found, they are punished administratively, and deportation proceedings are initiated.
""The drawing up of a report starts the expulsion procedure. The person is either detained and placed in a detention centre for foreigners in detention or, if there are humanitarian reasons, he or she is allowed to stay in his or her home until the end of the expulsion procedure. Because we have to understand that these are people who have lived here for a long time - for several decades. These properties are theirs, so they have the conditions for which they can stay in their place of residence. The information is then collected and sent to the Office for Citizenship and Migration Affairs, and then they decide whether to apply voluntary departure or forced expulsion from the Republic of Latvia,"" said Lieutenant Colonel Gatis Ruža, Head of the Rīga Service of the State Border Guard.
The amendments to the Immigration Law were adopted by the previous Saeima three years ago, when the elections were a week and a half away. Among other conditions, the new law also requires Russian citizens who were previously Latvian citizens or non-citizens to have their knowledge of the national language tested. Soon after, the law was amended again, allowing applicants to study the language and take the language exam within two years. According to Maira Roze, the head of the PMLP, there are 3871 persons in this group, for whom all social guarantees were maintained for this period.
The number of people applying for a repeat Latvian language test is currently increasing. One has tried to prove their proficiency as many as eight times.
According to the PMLP, the extended period will expire in the first half of next year for the majority of Russian citizens who would have to retake the language test and pass the security check. In January it will expire for 410 people, in February - 462, in March - 821, in April - 1,158 and in May - 548.
In total, 25,300 Russian citizens were affected by the first amendments to the Immigration Law. The majority of them - 16 thousand - received a permanent residence permit of the European Union. Around one thousand received a temporary residence permit, mostly on the basis of family reunification, less often on the basis of employment. 2.6 thousand people left on their own.
There is a small minority of Russian citizens who have shown no interest in settling their obligations with the country and have not responded to the invitation to leave voluntarily. A decision on forced expulsion is then taken.
So far, 10 people have been expelled. In such cases, the Russian citizen is allowed to collect his belongings and, in agreement with the Russian side, is taken to the border or allowed to fly out.
De Facto spoke to Nikolay, a Russian citizen affected by the latest amendments to the Immigration Law. He is 74 years old. He is retired but works as a mechanic in a company in Rīga. Although he has lived in Latvia for 37 years, he has not learnt Latvian. He says he has made do with Russian. Now he is taking Latvian language courses but it is not easy. He failed his first test. He has just had a second attempt. Asked what he thought about the potential risk of deportation, Nikolay said: ""I don't know. I don't pay much attention to it. But I think that my children, my grandchildren - they all work for Latvia. And I work too. Why should I leave? I don't know who I'm disturbing here. I don't understand.""
In this group of Russian citizens, about 2,000 people have to pass a language test. They have until the end of September to do it. No extension is being given here. However, 841 Russian citizens have not responded to the requirements themselves. They have missed the deadline to apply for the exam. That is why notices have already been sent to leave Latvia by mid-October.
""841 letters have gone out to people. Here again, people appeared who had heard nothing, seen nothing and only when they are no longer paid a pension do they realise that something is wrong. Then they call. Why am I not being paid my pension? We tell them: you have no residence permit. They ask: where is my residence permit? We say: you should comply with the law,"" said the head of the PMLP.
Alongside the language test, all Russian nationals are subject to a security check. In the past two years, the services have identified 327 Russian citizens who have been refused a residence permit as posing a potential risk to Latvia's national security. Another seven Russian citizens affected by the changes in immigration procedures were placed on the so-called black list on the recommendation of the State Security Service.

Brazilian PresidentLuiz Inacio Lula da Silvahas criticised the deployment of United States naval forces to the Caribbean, calling them a source of strain that could undermine peace in the region.
The South American leader expressed concern on Monday over the concentration of US forces, seen by some as a possible prelude to an attack onVenezuela.
“The presence of the armed forces of the largest power in the Caribbean Sea is a factor of tension,” Lula said during the opening of a virtual BRICS summit.
The US has said its military forces are in the region to counter drug trafficking. But the deployment has been paired with US threats against the government of Venezuelan PresidentNicolas Maduro, whom US President Donald Trump’s administration has accused of being closely linked with drug trafficking groups.
The Trump administration has provided no evidence for those claims and has often used vague allegations of connections to drug trafficking or criminal groups to justify extraordinary measures both at home and abroad.
Last week, the US carried out an unprecedented lethal attack on what the Trump administration said was a boat transporting drugs from Venezuela. Analysts have said the extrajudicial strike, which killed 11 people, waslikely illegal, but US officials have promised to carry out more attacks in the region.
Maduro has said the deployment is part of an effort to depose his government and called on the military and civilians to make preparations for a possible attack.
As the Trump administration takes aggressive steps to advance its priorities on issues such as trade, immigration and drug trafficking, some countries are seeking to bolster ties with powers like China.
Addressing the virtual BRICS conference via video call on Monday, Chinese PresidentXi Jinpingcalled for more cooperation in areas such as technology, finance and trade, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.
“The closer the BRICS countries cooperate, the more confidence, options and effective results they will have in addressing external risks and challenges,” he was quoted as saying.
Officials from India – a country, like Brazil and China, that has become a recent target of the Trump administration’s severetariff policies– also called for greater collaboration.
“The world requires constructive and cooperative approaches to promote trade that is sustainable,” External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said in comments published by India’s Ministry of External Affairs. “Increasing barriers and complicating transactions will not help. Neither would the linking of trade measures to nontrade matters.”
The virtual conference came aweek after leadersfrom China, Russia, India and other Eurasian nations gathered in Tianjin, China, where they presented a vision of a new international order at a moment of widening rifts between partner nations and the US.
The Trump administration recently targeted a Venezuelan boat it said was carrying drugs.
Trump is failing on several foreign policy fronts. So he decided to open up a new one against Venezuela.
Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro has accused the US of planning a military takeover.

The White House asked Ukrainian officials ahead of the meeting if Zelensky would wear a suit, according to a report
I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read ourPrivacy notice
Ukrainian president VolodymyrZelenskyarrived for hismeeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Officewearing an all black suit, but no tie – months after he was derided for his lack of formal dress during his previous, andnow infamous, visit to the White House.
The Ukrainian president wore a jacket, previously described as “suit-style” but not a full suit, as well as a black shirt during the sit-down Monday. His fashion choice was noted by members of the media who had criticized him in February.
“First of all, president Zelensky, you look fabulous in that suit. You look good,” said MAGA reporter Brian Glenn, who last time had asked the Ukrainian leader “Do you even own a suit?”
“That’s the one that attacked you,” Trump said to Zelensky, to which he replied with a knowing smile: “I remember.” The Ukrainian president then noted to Glenn: “You are in the same suit. I changed, you have not,” drawing laughter from the room, as well as Trump.
Zelensky’s black jacket was the same he wore to a June NATO summit in the Netherlands, which also marked the first time he had donned a business-style jacket since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in Ukraine in 2022 — and the fashion choice reportedly impressed Trump.
White House asked Ukrainian officials if Zelensky would wear a suit ahead of Monday’s meeting in Washington, D.C., with top European leaders and Trump, two sourcestoldAxios.
One Trump advisor jokingly told the outlet that “it would be a good sign for peace” if Zelensky dressed up Monday, but added, “We don’t expect him to do it.” They also did not expect the Ukrainian leader to wear a tie.
The high-stakesmeeting comes months after the president welcomed Zelensky into the West Wing in February, and madejabs about his customary military-style attire, jokingly telling the press, “he’s all dressed up today.”
However, it was Vice President JD Vance who more annoyed than Trump by the Ukrainian leader’s understated fashion choices on that occasion, particularly that he was without a tie, according to Axios.
Trump’s irritation during Zelensky’s last visit, whichdescended into a shouting match,was about more than just his fashion choices, and the president’s advisors say this time should go more smoothly.
""They've traveled very, very far, both of them. Zelensky will not show him pictures of dead children and then act like it's somehow his fault. The president has learned to just sort of like, you know, file away any irritations and go forward,” a Trump advisor toldAxios.
However,Monday’s meeting seemingly had a far more positive outcome,with Zelensky latertelling reporters that the bilateral with Trump had gone well. “I think that we had a very good conversation with President Trump, very good,” he said. “And it really was the best one, or, sorry, maybe the best one will be in the future.”
He also invited Trump to future peace talks with Putin, saying that he would be “happy” for the U.S. president to participate in trilateral talks, which Trump has expressed hope in.
“I think when we set that up, when we do — I think it's going to be when, not if — I think you're going to see some very, really positive moves,” he said. The president said he is set to talk to Putin later today following a wider meeting with other European leaders.
These key leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, are now discussing “possible exchanges of territory” and security guarantees for Ukraine.
Trump has not ruled out sending U.S. troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees for the nation. Trump said the issue would be one of the topic discussed with the leaders.

In sworn testimony presented to the Senate on Monday, Cezarah “Sarah” Discaya and Pacifico “Curlee” Discaya – a married couple – claimed that corrupt politicians and Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) officials routinely pressured them for illicit payments, sometimes name-dropping House Speaker Martin Romualdez and his ally Zaldy Co as supposed beneficiaries.
Six construction companies founded by the couple and their son, Gerrard William Francisco Discaya, bagged 345 solo and joint projects worth 25.2 billion Philippine pesos (US$440.6 million), dubbing them the “king and queen of flood control”. A total of nine construction companies are linked to Discaya and her husband, handling infrastructure projects related to flood control, roads and building construction.
Two of the Discayas’ companies, Alpha & Omega General Contractor & Development Corporation and St. Timothy Construction Corporation, were named in a list of the top 15 contractors that hogged 100 billion pesos worth of government flood control projects since 2022.
In an affidavit read aloud during a Senate Blue Ribbon Committee hearing, the Discayas said lawmakers had demanded “no less than 10 per cent and even up to 25 per cent” of contract values, calling such payments “standard procedure” in public infrastructure bidding."

Russian forces were spotted mocking Trump’scapitulationto Vladimir Putin during their peace summit by attaching American flags to their vehicles as they rode into battle in Ukraine.
Video footage first shared by Kremlin propaganda network RT showed Russian troops cruising into battle in a captured American M113 APC, which they described as a “trophy,” while flying both the U.S. and Russian flags in tandem.
Using a captured American M113 APC, now emblazoned with russian and US flags, russia is sending a signal of its “peace intentions” in the frontlines of Zaporizhzhia region.pic.twitter.com/HQh9cztNnV
“How should this be understood? Russian propagandists are showing a video where Russian equipment goes on the attack with flags of Russia and the USA,”saidAndriy Yermak, the head of Ukraine’s Presidential Office and Volodymyr Zelesnky’s right-hand man.
“In fact, Russians are using United States symbols in their own terrorist, aggressive war with the killing of civilian people. Maximum audacity,” he added.
The move comes just hours before President Trump meets with Zelensky and other European leaders for high-level peace talks at the White House following his summit with Putin in Alaska last Friday.
While little official progress was made during the meeting, Trump has since beenparroting Russian talking pointsand putting pressure on Zelensky to accept a peace deal which many view as overly-favorable to the invading forces, demanding Ukraine cede its occupied territory to Russia in exchange for freezing the frontlines.
“President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to,” Trump said in a rant onTruth Socialon Monday, which also saw him demand Ukraine stay out of NATO and accuse Barack Obama of escalating the conflict in Ukraine by “giving” Crimea to Russia in 2014, when it was illegally annexed by Kremlin forces.
“The Russians have already declared the United States an ally and are storming Mala Tokmachka in M113 armoured personnel carriers... with Russian and American flags,” said Petr Andryushchenko, Ukraine’s head of the Centre for the Study of the Occupation.
“This is the logical conclusion to all of Trump’s absurdity. And all of this is on the official propaganda channel of Russia Today. There are no words.”
Putin meanwhile has shown no desire to submit to the president’s wishes, and flaunted his authority by launching a fresh wave of missile strikes in Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia ahead of the summit on Monday which have killed seven civilians and injured 20 more.
Six children aged 6 to 17 were among those injured in the attack on Kharkiv, with a toddler and 16-year-old boy confirmed dead as a result of the attack,Reutersreports.
Responding to the attack, Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks were “demonstrative” proof of Russia’s intentions and showed they had no intention of ending the war.
“Russians are deliberately killing people, particularly children,” Zelensky said. “As of now, seven people have been killed as a result of the drone strike in Kharkiv, the youngest being a girl who is only a year and a half old, and dozens have been injured, including children.”
He added: “Putin will commit demonstrative killings to maintain pressure on Ukraine and Europe, as well as to humiliate diplomatic efforts”.
“That is precisely why we are seeking assistance to put an end to the killings. That is why reliable security guarantees are required. That is why Russia should not be rewarded for its participation in this war.
“The war must be ended. And it is Moscow that must hear the word: ‘Stop.’”
Trump however has continued to urge Kyiv to “make a deal” with the Russian autocrat, previously telling Zelensky that “Russia is a very big power, and they’re not.”

Israelhas ordered the demolition of the two men's homes and said every structure built without permission in the towns of Qatanna and Qubeiba would be demolished.
Defence minister Israel Katz added that 750 people - who he said are the men's relatives and fellow villagers - will have their permits to work in Israel removed.
Analysis:The bus shooting has exacerbated already high tensions
Israel says demolishing the homes of attackers' relatives and neighbours is a deterrent to future assaults - but human rights groups and Palestinians consider the practice a form of collective punishment, prohibited by international law.
Benjamin Netanyahuvisited the scene of the shooting at Ramot Junction on Monday and has been assessing, with his heads of security, what happened.

The Israeli prime minister sent condolences to the families of the victims and said Israel was ""in an intense war against terror on several fronts"".

It is understood a total of about 15 people were injured, with six in a serious condition."

President Donald Trump said he was ready to sanction Russia after Moscow launched its largest air attack against Ukraine since thestart of the war on Sunday, setting Kyiv’s government headquarters on fire and killing at least five, including one infant.
Forty-four more were injured in the attack that the Ukrainian Defense Department said included over 800 Shahed-typestrike drones, 9 Iskander-K cruise missiles, and 4 Iskander-M ballistic missiles, which hit residential apartments and set ablaze the main government building where ministers meet.

It was the second mass Russian drone and missile attack to target Kyiv in as many weeks, and comes less than a month after Trump's high-stakes peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaskafailed to achieve a ceasefire.

Trump has been under mounting pressure from allies toimpose greater sanctionson Russia for its continued attacks on Ukraine, but the president continued to insist that he could negotiate an end to the war even as Putin showed little interest in halting his invasion.
Asked by reporters on Sunday if he was ready to impose a second round of sanctions against Russia following the attack, Trump said: “Yeah, I am.”
Trump's envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, wrote on X that Russia “appears to be escalating”, and that the attack “was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier called on Trump to punish Putin for the devastating attacks.

“Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have already begun long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,” Zelensky said on X. “It has been repeatedly said in Washington that sanctions will follow a refusal to talk…The world can force the Kremlin criminals to stop the killings – all that is needed is political will.”
Zelensky added that he had spoken to French President Emannuel Macron about boosting Ukraine’s air defenses.
Soon after the talks in Alaska, Trump said he was working to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelensky. But Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said thatno such meeting was in the works.
In recent days, Trump had continued to insist that talks between Zelensky and Putin are possible despite a ratcheting up of Russian attacks.
“I've been watching it, I've been seeing it, and I've been talking about it with President Putin and President Zelenskyy,”Trump told CBS earlier this week.""Something is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done.""

Timur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, said on Telegram that more than 90 rescuers, more than 160 police officers, and more than 200 utility workers were working Sunday at the site of the attack in the district of Svyatoshyn in Kyiv. This is the first time since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that its strikes have hit and damaged the government headquarters in the center of the city, which lies close to Zelensky’s office.
Zelensky said people were injured or killed in other parts of the country that also came under attack last night, including Kryvyi Rih, Dnipro, Kremenchuk and Odessa.
The attack also comes just days after a meeting of Ukraine's allies in Paris, with over 30 countries participating in discussions for security guarantees for Kyiv. Top U.S. official and United States Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff  was in attendance at the meeting where Zelensky gave a “special thanks” to Trump for “all his efforts to end this war and for America’s readiness to provide support to Ukraine on its part.”

During the meeting, European world leaders, including French President Emanuel Macron, accused Russia of stalling peace negotiations.
“If Moscow doesn’t want to respect these conditions, we will have to take further steps with the U.S.,” Macron said. “The key argument here is that there are no limitations for the defence of Ukraine.”

A U.S. official familiar with the matter confirmed toRolling Stonecertain details regarding the Trump-signed directive, which was first reportedbyThe New YorkTimes. Other knowledgeable sources, working in or close to this iteration of the Trump White House, say that unlessMexicogives Trump what he wants, this administration is serious about attacking its neighbor to the south. And according to administration officials and others familiar with the Trump administration preparations, it’s not a bluff: This American president wants to violently breach Mexico’s sovereignty — if and when he feels like it. He, after all, effectivelycampaigned on doing soduring his 2024 bid.
Just don’t call any of this a plan for an invasion, U.S. government officials implore.
Speaking about the new directive, a senior administration official says, “It’s not a negotiating tactic. It’s notArt of the Deal. The president has been clear that a strike … is coming unless we see some big, major changes.”
Indeed, this seems less like a negotiating tactic and more like a Mafia-style intimidation campaign, with the supposed goal of extorting the Mexican government into miraculously solving America’sfentanylcrisis. But that doesn’t make the threat to Mexico’s sovereignty any less real.
In response to Trump’s directive to target drug cartels, Mexico PresidentClaudia Sheinbaumlast week rejected the use of U.S. military forces in Mexico. But earlier this week, Mexicoextradited 26 alleged cartel membersto the United States in a move hailed by Attorney General Pam Bondi as part of the Trump administration’s “historic efforts to dismantle cartels and foreign terrorist organizations.” The fugitives face a variety of federal and state charges, including drug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, and money laundering. Among those apprehended are leaders from major drug cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG).Editor’s picksThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So FarThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All TimeThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time100 Best Movies of the 21st Century
A similar transfer occurred in February, when 29 cartel members were sent to the United States by the Mexican government. Both transfers came in the wake of saber-rattling by the Trump administration. The moves, according to experts tracking cartel operations, are an attempt to stave off U.S. military intervention and preserve ongoing trade negotiations.
For years, Trump and other leaders in the Republican Party have openly threatened Mexico with an American invasion, citing the fentanyl crisis and drug cartels as a justification. The GOP and its leaderare not shy aboutthis: Theyopenly talk aboutit andembrace itas if it’s sound policy.
At a Decembereventheld at Harvard University to discuss the 2024 election,Rolling Stoneasked several Trump lieutenants why the then-president-elect and other Republicans kept talking so much about invading Mexico. James Blair, now a White House deputy chief of staff, replied with a straight face that candidate Trump “never” proposed invading Mexico. (As recently as late January, the presidenttold reportersthat he absolutely was not taking the possibility of sending U.S. special ops into Mexico off the table. “Could happen,” he said, adding that “stranger things have happened.”)
The administration took a first step in January, when the State Department declared eight cartels — the Sinaloa cartel, CJNG, the Northeast cartel, the Michoacán family, the United Cartels, and the Gulf Cartel — to beforeign terrorist organizations. The Salvadoran MS-13 and the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang were also on the list. This designation triggers U.S. sanctions, including asset freezes, restrictions on financial transactions, and prohibitions on U.S. citizens and organizations providing support. But Geoffrey Corn, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, says the terror designations don’t authorize the use of force.Related ContentWe Read the Extremely Creepy Epstein Birthday Book So You Don't Have ToEverything We Know So Far About the Murder of Iryna ZarutskaMAGA Finally Gets Some New Epstein Files. They're Not HappyAmerica’s Problems Aren’t That Complicated
“You have to make a credible argument that the U.S. faces an armed attack,” says Corn, a retired U.S. Army judge advocate officer who served as the Army’s senior law of war adviser. “This characterization that we’re under attack by these cartels is essential to using the president’s war powers.” (The terror designations also provided the justification to ship hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.)
He argues that the Trump administration has characterized migration as an invasion, so it isn’t a stretch to think they’d consider the shipment ofdrugsas an attack. Corn admits he could craft an argument that drugs are an attack, Mexico is unable to prevent use of its territory for this attack, and special operations raids are thus a proportional response. But is that a viable policy? America tried to shoot its way out of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with disastrous effects.
“It is really easy to get the United States into a war and very hard to get us out,” Corn tellsRolling Stone, adding that there is little to check military adventurism after the attacks on Sept. 11. “It’s gotten too easy to go to war.”
And Trump, despite campaigning as a peace president, seems eager to rely on the military as his hammer,deploying troops to Los Angelesto quell protests against immigration raids andnow to Washington, D.C., after a group of teens allegedly beat up a Trump administration staffer known as “Big Balls.”
“When your only tool is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail,” Corn says.
Rolling Stonereported in November that Trump’s incoming administration was considering a “soft invasion” of Mexico, in which American special operations would be sent covertly to assassinate cartel leaders. Potential plans on the table at the time included everything from drone strikes and commando raids, airstrikes on cartel infrastructure or drug labs, sending in military trainers and “advisers,” and waging cyber warfare against drug lords and their networks.
But a former intelligence officer who’s been tracking the issue says the new Trump directive is bigger than just the Mexican cartels. The focus is on interrupting cartel operations throughout the region. Before the terror announcement, the U.S. military and CIA were already increasing surveillance flights of Mexican drug cartels. The drone flights are part of the ongoing blitz of surveillance flights likely intercepting and decrypting cell phone signals near the southernborder.
U.S. officials say since Trump was sworn back into office in January, there have been multiple Pentagon, White House, and intelligence-strategy meetings on how to use the American military for cartel operations, and that the president and some of his top advisers have personally demanded items like target lists for potential drone strikes on Mexican territory. A Defense Department source says units at Fort Bragg are preparing target packages. The source declined to share which unit or who the targets might be, but the North Carolina post is home to both the Army Special Operations Command and the Joint Special Operations Command, which oversees Delta Force and Seal Team Six.
A federal agent working on the southern border says there has been an “extreme refocusing” on cartel operations in the past few months. In the blood sport of interagency cooperation, the agent says there was a real sense of cooperation, including intelligence sharing with agencies usually focused on external threats.
If, or when, Trump decides to blow something up in Mexico, he will be presented with an already prepared menu of options, sources say, which would include possible targets like high-profile cartel hubs or leadership hideouts, or drug-making facilities, as identified by American intelligence gathering. Stefano Ritondale, a former Army intelligence officer who uses the handle All Source News on X, says if the Trump administration does act, the target will likely be big and symbolic.
“Why piss off the Mexican government for a chemist or arms dealer or money launderer?” says Ritondale, who also works as chief intelligence officer for Artorias, a private intelligence and data analysis company.
In such a scenario, the president, according to those who’ve spoken to him about this, would want a target deemed important enough to drug-lord operations that he could go on TV to make a national address and tout the historic nature of the military operation,as he did with thedeath of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
If Ritondale was betting, his money is on Nemesio Oseguera, also known as El Mencho, the leader of CJNG. The U.S. government has offered a reward of $10 million for information leading to his arrest, one of the highest bounties ever offered.
“El Mencho is the only person worth doing it,” he says.
One of the six designated cartels, CJNG, is considered by the Mexican government to be the most powerful drug cartel in Mexico. With assets estimated at $20 billion, CJNG generates revenue from drugs like fentanyl and cocaine as well as extorting the tortilla, avocado, lime, and chicken industries. Fuel theft and counterfeit timeshare dealing also provide a revenue stream. On Wednesday, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned four individuals and 13 companies in Mexico fortimeshare fraudorchestrated by the CJNG.
Another target might be Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, a key leader within Los Chapitos. Known as “El Chapito,” the faction’s primary business is international drug trafficking, and it has dominated smuggling fentanyl into the United States.
“The narcos are paying attention,” says Mica Treviño, who runs CartelInsider.com, a website dedicated to researching the cartels. “For now, their focus is still on their rivals. Even so, nobody’s missing the fact that the U.S. is circling overhead, watching every move.”Trending StoriesJustin Baldoni Accused of 'Verbal Abuse' on Second Project: 'I Had Repeated, Negative Interactions'We Read the Extremely Creepy Epstein Birthday Book So You Don't Have ToSinger D4vd 'Cooperating' After Woman's Body Found in Car Registered to HimEverything We Know So Far About the Murder of Iryna Zarutska
A strike against a cartel leader would likely do little to accomplish the mission of stopping the flow of drugs across the southern border.Carolyn Gallaher, a professor studying guerrilla and paramilitary violence at American University’s School of International Service, toldRolling Stonein January that a campaign to decapitate the cartels would only create a succession crisis that would be settled with violence, and would ultimately do little to accomplish the administration’s goals of stemming the flow of drugs. This sentiment is echoed by the agent near the border.

Source: Zelenskyy in an interview with French weekly news magazineLe Point, as reported byUkrinform
Quote: ""Some elements of the media claim that if Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from the eastern regions of our country, it will bring peace there. But this is not true. Putin seized Crimea to use it as a springboard to encircle the south.
He seized part of our country's east in 2014 to use it as a springboard for the complete occupation of these regions. If tomorrow we were somehow to leave Donbas, which will not happen, we would open up an unprotected space for Putin next to the one-and-a-half-million city of Kharkiv. He would also seize the industrial centre of Dnipro, which would open up new opportunities for him.""
Details: Zelenskyy believes that Europeans should broaden their perspective and imagine what would have happened if Putin's original plan – to seize all of Ukraine – had succeeded.
Quote: ""If Putin had managed to seize our entire country, he would have used it in the same way, as a springboard. Whether he does this or not will depend on how strong Europe is. If Europe is strong, he is unlikely to do anything, but if it is weak, it will suffer from Russia's actions.""
Details: Zelenskyy noted that the distance between Moscow and Paris is less than 3,000 kilometres.
Quote: ""But the missiles that Russia is using against Ukraine today have a range of 2,500 kilometres. We ourselves have missiles with a range of 3,000 kilometres. And war drives technological development here, in Europe, but also in Russia. With such technological development there can no longer be any distant wars.
Believe me, in two years the Russians will have many missiles – and so will we – with a range of 5,000 kilometres. The sea will not protect anyone, the ocean will not protect anyone. In this respect, the weapons that Russia uses today are not so different from nuclear delivery systems.""
Details: Zelenskyy reiterated that it is Ukraine's fate that will determine how much the war affects Europe and where its eastern border will lie.
Quote: ""If Ukraine does not hold out, that border will be Poland or perhaps Germany. Europe was once divided in this way. The eastern border of West Germany was the border of the western world. Today everything depends on us, on how far we allow Russian ambitions to go.""
Background: Zelenskyy believes that ascenario similar to that of South Korea, in that no real peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War but the country still managed to prosper, could take place in Ukraine.

European Commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic and Commissioner for Agriculture Christophe Hansen will be inDelhithis week to lead the negotiations, their first visit since February this year when the College of Commissioners travelled to India.
These two Commissioners, who are equivalent to Cabinet Ministers, will be leading a 30-member negotiating team from Brussels and will meet their counterparts in Delhi, Commerce MinisterPiyush Goyaland Agriculture MinisterShivraj Singh Chouhan.
The EU visit is aimed at expediting the negotiations to seal the final deal. Talks between India and the EU have gained urgency in the light of the tariff war unleashed by the Trump administration.
The upcoming round of negotiations assumes significance as it follows the announcement of the EU-US deal. The EU has indicated flexibilities for the US on the contentious Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).
Officials in the Commerce and Industry Ministry said Delhi will now push for similar concessions since the EU had earlier taken a rigid approach on CBAM in negotiations with India.
Herve Delphin, EU Ambassador to India, had toldThe Indian Expressat its Idea Exchange programme in June that the EU’s CBAM was not a trade measure and “not part of trade and the FTA”.
“It’s about compliance with our climate agenda to accelerate decarbonisation,” Delphin had said.
In an interview with The Indian Express on September 3, Urjit Patel, India’s newly appointed Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund, said, “The US has basically driven a truck through CBAM”.
Negotiations over CBAM are crucial as the Indian industry has begun facing the impact of the regulation that is to come into effect January 1, 2026.
Pankaj Chadha, Chairman, Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) of India, said, “The annual compliance cost to meet CBAM requirements for a MSME is around Rs 15 lakh. We have asked for support from the government. We are already facing challenges in the US market.”
Experts said that unlike the US – its recent 50 per cent steel and aluminium tariffs are harsh but clearly defined – the EU’s trade barriers are complex and opaque. Data showed that steel and aluminium shipments to the EU dropped by 24.4 per cent – from $7.71 billion to $5.82 billion in FY25 compared to the previous financial year.
On September 4, Prime Minister Modi and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Antonio Costa spoke on phone and discussed “early conclusion of the India-EU FTA”.
According to sources, the two sides have to negotiate about 26 or 27 chapters in all – each of them tackling different issues and themes – as part of the trade agreement.
Of these 27 chapters, the two sides have been able to close or conclude negotiations on 11 chapters so far — these include intellectual property rights, customs and trade facilitation, transparency, good regulatory practices, mutual administrative assistance, small and medium enterprises, sustainable food systems, dispute settlements, competition and subsidies, digital trade and anti-fraud practices. They are expected to conclude the chapter on capital movements in the next round of negotiations, sources said.
The substantial progress in the digital trade chapter is significant since India’s booming service sector could benefit the most from integration with the EU. The digital trade chapter in trade negotiations typically addresses rules and commitments related to online commerce and sticky issues such as cross-border flow of data and digital services.
Commerce Ministry officials have said that they have fast-tracked EU trade negotiations by holding monthly talks with the 27-member bloc. In the last 12 months, India and the EU had conducted four rounds of negotiations.
The chapters on sanitary and phytosanitary issues and agriculture are expected to be one of the most contentious ones, apart from the issues related to whisky, cars, automobiles.
Sources said Agriculture Commissioner Hansen’s visit is crucial since agriculture has been a hot-button issue for India and Europe. It is learnt that the two sides have agreed to keep “dairy, sugar and rice out of the agriculture trade negotiations”.
The two sides, sources said, have seen a window of opportunity in the current geo-economic and geo-political climate, given the Trump administration’s tariffs on strategic US partners like India and the EU.
Delhi is keen to conclude the deal with the EU by the end of the year, and they are looking at a full-trade deal, as they negotiate with the US on the trade deal.
Sources said the US administration’s actions are “spurring” the India-EU negotiations so that they can close the deal by the end of the year. This will be in time for the India-EU leaders’ summit early next year – the deadline under which the two sides are working on.
Besides India, the EU is also negotiating trade deals with Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and UAE.
As one of India’s largest trading partners, the EU accounted for €124 billion worth of trade in goods in 2023 or 12.2% of total Indian trade. India accounted for 2.2% of the EU’s total trade in goods in 2023. Trade in services between the EU and India reached €59.7 billion in 2023, up from €30.4 billion in 2020.

The planned operation was conducted by Somali security forces in coordination with the US Africa Command, which has been instrumental in neutralizing the militants using air surveillance.
According to the security teams, the planned operation was conducted in the Ceel-dhiiqo Weyne area, located between Ceel-lahelay and Ceel-garas in the Galgaduud region. The al-Shabaab fighters have frequented the Galgaduud region for a while.
Among those killed were senior Al-Shabaab leaders who are said to be responsible for a series of attacks across the country. The government is yet to publish the names of the senior leaders, but termed the outing as 'successful'.
The operation also left at least 13 other fighters critically injured, and they have been taken into custody for questioning. The US Africa Command is said to have participated in the air raid as the local forces commandeered ground combat.
Security forces also targeted a facility where more than 400 militants were being trained. Efforts are underway to pursue the remaining fighters who fled towards the Ceelbuur district, officials said in a statement, Saturday.
The government of Somalia is closely monitoring Al-Shabaab movements across the country, with the long-term strategy being to defeat the militants for the stabilisation of the country. The African Union is also closely working with Somali troops.

Israel and India have signed a bilateral investment agreement to expand mutual trade during far-right Israeli Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich’s trip to the South Asian country, which deepened its ties with Israel under Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The agreement, signed in New Delhi by Smotrich and Indian Minister of Corporate Affairs Nirmala Sitharaman, aims to boost trade and investment flows between the two countries. Sitharaman stressed the need for greater collaboration in “cybersecurity, defence, innovation and high-technology”.
The deal marked “an important strategic step for our joint vision”, said Smotrich, who has been sanctioned by several Western countries for his links to illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank.
“The agreement reached today between Israel and India reflects our economic growth, innovation and mutual prosperity,” he wrote on X.
“This agreement will open new opportunities for investors in both countries, strengthen Israeli exports, and provide businesses with the certainty and tools to grow in one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing markets.”
India’s Ministry of Finance described the deal as a “historic milestone”, adding that it will foster cooperation in “fintech innovation, infrastructure development, financial regulation, and digital payment connectivity”.
The deal comes as Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has caused a global outrage. More than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its brutal war on Gaza in October 2023.
Bilateral trade stood at $3.9bn in 2024, while current mutual investments are worth about $800m, according to official figures. But the bulk of the trade between the two countries is in the domain of defence and security, with New Delhi being Israel’s largest weapons buyer.
Last year, Indian firms also sold Israel rockets and explosives during Israel’s war on Gaza, anAl Jazeera investigationrevealed.
The agreement comes as New Delhi moves closer to Israel, even as Israel faces growing political isolation over its genocidal war on Gaza. India was one of the first countries to reach out to Israel after the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel led by Hamas, condemning it as “an act of terror”.
Indian authorities have cracked down on pro-Palestine protests, even criminalising them in some cases, whileallowing pro-Israel rallies.
India still supports the so-called two-state solution for the resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it has abstained from several United Nations resolutions that have been critical of Israeli rights violations against Palestinians.
In 2024, India also abstained from a UN General Assembly vote calling for an “immediate, unconditional and permanent” ceasefire in Gaza.
Indians make up the largest group of foreign students in Israel, while Israeli construction companies have sought permission to hire up to100,000 Indian workersto replace Palestinians whose permits were revoked after Israel launched its brutal war on Gaza in October 2023.
India has also refused to condemn Israel’s war on Iran, and declined to support theShanghai Cooperation Organisation’s(SCO) condemnation of Israeli attacks. But after United States President Donald Trump’s 50 percent tariffs on India, which took effect late last month, New Delhi this month signed an SCO declaration that condemned the US-Israeli bombing of Iran.
India has also moved to mend its ties with rival China, in a setback for years of US policy using New Delhi as a counterweight to Beijing.
China and India should be partners, not rivals, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Modi on the sidelines of the SCO summit in Tianjin.

ByJohn T Psaropoulos
Ukraine has pounded Russia’s refineries with deep strikes in the past week, worsening its petrol shortages and causing Moscow to extend a ban on exports of petroleum products.
Russia responded with a deadly attack on Kyiv and a barrage of statements portraying Moscow’s “special military operation” as a success and Ukraine as teetering on the edge of surrender.
Russian President Vladimir Putin used his appearance at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to suggest Russian energy exports to China and India were booming, but reports suggested that Moscow is heavily discounting its crude to hold onto clients.
Ukraine’s European and regional allies are meeting on Thursday to try to finalise security guarantees in case a ceasefire should come about, while calling on US President Donald Trump to use sanctions to press Putin into direct negotiations with Kyiv.
Russia redeployed marines and paratroopers – elite units – from Ukraine’s northern Sumy region to the eastern region of Donetsk on September 1, suggesting it may be preparing a renewed push for the city of Pokrovsk, which Ukraine has identified as a Russian key tactical objective in the east since August 2024.
Russia last week gave up on an offensive for Dobropillia, a town whose capture would have enabled an encirclement of Pokrovsk from the north, after stiff Ukrainian resistance.
Ukrainian Armed Forces Commander-in-Chief OleksandrSyrskiiconfirmed that Dobropillia and Pokrovsk remained among the most intense battle zones along the front last week, along with Lyman, a city further north.
Between Lyman and Pokrovsk lies the so-called “fortress belt” of cities – Sloviansk, Kramatorsk, Druzhivka and Konstiantynivka – considered one of Ukraine’s most heavily fortified sections of the front, suggesting Russia may be intending its encirclement rather than head-on assault.
Ahead of Putin’s visit to Tianjin, China, on Sunday to attend the SCO summit, Russian Chief of the General StaffValery Gerasimovon Saturday said the Russian “unstoppable offensive” had seized more than 3,500 square kilometres (1,350 square miles) and 149 settlements since March.
“Gerasimov is inflating most of his claims,” the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, assessed, concluding that Russian gains stood at 2,346sq km and 130 settlements since March.
The ISW also disagreed with Russian Defence MinisterAndrei Belousov’s claim on Friday that “at the beginning of the year, we were liberating 300–400 square kilometres monthly, and this figure has reached 600–700 square kilometres”.  The ISW said Russia had taken 445sq km in July and about 500sq km in August.
Ukraine’s head of the Center for Countering Disinformation, AndriyKovalenko, also disagreed with Gerasimov’s claim to have captured half of the city of Kupiansk in the north.
“All the fantasies of Russian war correspondents about control over half of the city of Kupiansk up to the centre do not correspond to reality,” he wrote on the Telegram messaging service. “The traditional tactic is that runners with flags run around, they are filmed by a drone, and then propagandists do their job.”
Russia did score operational success in the western Black Sea for the first time since 2022, when it had lost its flagship guided missile cruiser Moskva and control over Zmiinyi Island.
On August 28, theRussianMinistry of Defence said it had sunk the Ukrainian reconnaissance shipSimferopolin a drone strike at the mouth of the Danube river. Surface kamikaze drone footage depicted an approach towards a ship matching the Simferopol, and separate footage recorded an explosion.
Ukraine pioneered the use of naval drones to sink Russian ships in the western part of the Black Sea. This may be the first recorded instance of Russia successfully using the same tactics and doing so at the very edge of European Union territorial waters.
On the same day, Russia conducted one of its largest aerial attacks on Kyiv, aiming much of its salvo of 598 drones and 31 missiles there.
Thedeathtoll eventually reached 26, including four children, after a residential building in the Darnytskyi neighbourhood was destroyed bytwo missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy laid flowers there the following day.
Between August 28 and September 3, Russia launched 2,189 drones and 108 missiles in all at Ukraine’s cities behind the front line. Ukraine intercepted 88 percent of the drones and 79 percent of the missiles.
Ukraine struck back in the Black Sea on August 28, when its military intelligence rendered the Kalibr-carrying shipBuyan-Minoperable, after striking it with two drones.
But its main effort was on Russian soil.
On the same day, Ukrainian drones struck the Kuibyshev refinery in Russia’s Samara region, 1,000km east of Ukraine. They also struck the Afipsky refinery in Krasnodar Krai, some 400km from unoccupied Ukraine.
The two refineriescan processover 13 million tonnes of oil a year, just under 5 percent of Russia’s total capacity, said Ukrainian officials,and are keyto the Russian war machine.
Industry sources toldReutersthat Kuibyshev’s two primary refining units had been hit and all oil processing had stopped. Processing had resumed only a week earlier, after a Ukrainian strike on August 2.
On Friday,Kovalenkosaid drones had struck the Krasnodar and Syrzan refineries, both of which have been struck before. Geolocatedfootageconfirmed the Syrzan hit, andKrasnodarofficials admitted a fire in their facility.
Reuters estimated that in August alone, Ukraine had taken out 17 percent of Russian refining capacity.
Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces commanderRobert “Magyar” Brovdiput the figure at 21 percent.
Russia last weekextendedan export ban on refined petroleum products by a month, until October 31, to maintain “a stable situation in the domestic fuel market”. The ban has been in force since March 1.
Russian officials havedocumentedpetrol rationing in Russia and the occupied territories. Russia saidit would seekto raise its exports of crude oil by 200,000 barrels a day, because it couldn’t process the oil itself.
Crude oil sells for less than refined products anyway, but reports last week suggested Russia was heavily discounting its crude in an effort to retain customers. According toBloomberg, Indian refiners were being offered a $4 a barrel discount compared with Brent crude prices, up from $2.5 a week before and $1 in July.
Ukraine has also sought to limit Russian exports, which bring cash for its war economy.
Last week, officials at the Ust-Luga export terminal near St Petersburg said the terminal would operate at half of its capacity due to pipeline damage from Ukrainian drones.
Ukraine has been developing its own long-distance kill vehicles to strike deep inside Russia without Western weapons, whose use is often restricted.
Last month, it unveiled its first heavy cruise missile, the FP-5, nicknamed the Flamingo, capable of a 3,000km range carrying a 1,150kg warhead, and on Monday may have made afirst battlefield useof that missile against a Russian border post near occupied Crimea.

""No sanctions will be able to force the Russian Federation to change the consistent position that our president has repeatedly spoken about,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskovtolda Russian state media reporter.
The comments come as the European Union is preparing a 19th package of sanctions targeting Russian banks and the energy sector, BloombergreportedSept. 8. U.S. President Donald Trump has also repeatedlythreatenedto implement secondary sanction on Russian oil if Moscow's invasion continues, although he has yet to do so.
Peskov further claimed that sanction ""turned out to be absolutely useless in terms of exerting pressure on Russia.""
Despite Peskov's claims, sanction have undeniably played an impact on Russia's economic fortunes, vastly limiting the country's trade with international partners, and weakening the country's ability to sell oil to fuel the country's war machine.
Following an initial economic surge led by the country's defense industry following the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, Russia's economy has continued to face uncertainty amid highinflation, slowedeconomic growth, and near-recordinterest rates.
Despite the challenges faced by Russia's economy, Moscow has shown no indication it is ready to halt its war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedlyrepeatedly refusedto attend an in-person meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky, brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Russian military officials have echoed the Kremlin's sentiments, with the chief of the General Staff of the Russian army, Valery Gerasimovstatingon Aug. 30 that ""the implementation of the tasks of the (full-scale invasion of Ukraine) by the Joint Group of Troops will continue by conducting offensive actions.""
Russia has continued to launch attacks at Ukrainian cities in recent weeks.
Overnight on Sept. 7, Moscow launched itslargest-ever drone attackon Ukraine, killing at least 5 people and injured 44 others. The attack also struck a government building, the Cabinet of Ministers building in Kyiv, for the first time.
In recent days, Trump has claimed that he is prepared to begin a ""second phase"" ofsanctionson Russia, as U.S. officials have grownincreasingly criticalof Russia's attacks on civilians.
Zelensky said on Sept. 7 following the large-scale attack on Kyiv that Ukraine is ""counting on a strong reaction from America. This is what is needed."" The U.S. president has repeatedly called on the United States to implement further economic pressure to weaken Moscow's war machine.

The bombing took place around 11 a.m. while local residents lined up to receive pensions, according to officials. The casualties included local pensioners and employees of Ukrposhta, Ukraine's national post service, who were delivering the payments.
The number includes 990 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

Correspondence between Egypt and Israel has been completely cut off, with no progress in talks to secure a truce in Gaza, one senior intelligence official said.
Negotiations are currently ongoing between Israel and the US, whileQatarhas a minimal role as a mediator, with no concrete results on the horizon.
“Repeated Egyptian intelligence missions to Israel recently returned home empty-handed. The last delegation received no clear or positive responses, only hollow promises to reply to Washington’s latest peace proposal,” the source told MEE.
“Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is determined to invade, destroy and occupy Gaza.”
Hamas this week accepted the latest ceasefire proposal, but Israel has rejected it - despite reportedly signing off on it in the first place.
Some Israeli allies have attempted to lay the blame for the impasse on Hamas’ recent successful attacks on soldiers. However, Egyptian sources say these were not a major factor.
'For Netanyahu, success in taking over Gaza is a matter of dignity to restore his prestige - even if it means sacrificing the hostages. That’s why Israel has ignored Washington’s proposal'
- Egyptian intelligence source
“Even before the Hamas operations, it was clear from the latest visits of Egyptian security delegations that the Israeli side was never serious about pursuing a ceasefire or dealing with the issue with the gravity it deserves,” the source said.
Egyptian and Qatari intelligence officials have repeatedly pressed the US to support a truce, allow humanitarian aid into Gaza and secure the release of captives held by Hamas.
“But there has been no response, as Washington has given its full blessing to every Israeli move,” the source said.
Nevertheless, the source saidEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisihas instructedGeneral Intelligence Service chief Hassan Rashadand other officials negotiating the Gaza ceasefire “to continue contacts with all regional and international parties to secure a truce”.
MEE revealedlast month that Egypt has for months been training Palestinians from the occupied West Bank to take over security in Gaza if a ceasefire is reached.
Another high-level intelligence source, meanwhile, revealed to MEE that Israeli leaders are considering a symbolic deadline:7 October, marking the two-year anniversary of the war.
On that date, they are planning to raise the Israeli flag over Gaza City and declare it fully occupied.
“For Netanyahu, success in taking over Gaza is a matter of dignity to restore his prestige - even if it means sacrificing the hostages. That’s why Israel has ignored Washington’s ceasefire proposal, which Hamas has already agreed to,” the second official told MEE.
Though Israel says it is pursuing the war to free the remaining captives taken by Hamas on 7 October 2023, senior ministers insist they are not a priority, while military leaders warn that only a ceasefire deal will secure their release.
Meanwhile, Netanyahu has vowed to fully and indefinitely occupy Gaza City.
Egyptian intelligence agencies now predict that Washington will treat the Israeli captives as collateral damage, as the Israeli government has.
“We expect a devastating escalation, brutal street battles and suicide attacks by Hamas that could test the occupation army’s capacity to handle resistance - or force it back to the negotiating table if losses mount,” the second source said.
Egypt was the first Arab country to normalise relations with Israel. And despite widespread public sympathy for the Palestinian cause, Egypt and Israel have maintained strong ties since signing their US-sponsoredpeace treatyin 1979.
Under the treaty, the Sinai Peninsula was divided into zones with strict limits on the deployment of troops and heavy weaponry. Over the years, exceptions have been negotiated, particularly after Egypt’s 2013 coup, when the Egyptian military increased its presence in northern Sinai to combat aninsurgency.
But the genocide has pushed bilateral relations to one of their lowest points in decades. Cairo sees the Israeli war on Gaza as a threat to border stability, a blow to its diplomatic efforts and a potential risk to the durability of the peace treaty.
A key point of contention between Egypt and Israel is the Israeli control of the Philadelphi Corridor, a narrow strip along the Sinai-Gaza border that it seized in May 2024.
While Egypt argues the move violates the treaty, Israel says it is a necessary buffer to prevent arms smuggling.
The Israeli takeover of the border area has also fully enforced the siege on Gaza, where famine has been declared after months of forced starvation.
Egypt-Israel ties have become even more strained recently as Israeli and American officials promote the idea of expelling Palestinians from Gaza into Sinai - a concept that is anathema to Cairo.
“The Israeli army even considered strikes along the border fence with Egypt to partially demolish it and push Palestinians from Gaza into Egyptian Rafah border crossing against Cairo’s will,” the second intelligence source said.
“The Egyptian armed forces strongly oppose the idea of relocating Palestinians to Egypt. Cairo has made it clear that any military strike on its border would trigger a direct response and might involve the Egyptian army in a war with Israel.”
On 19 August, MEErevealedthat Egypt had deployed around 40,000 forces along the Egyptian border with Gaza to hinder the possible passage of Palestinians into Sinai.
'The gas deal is Israel’s largest ever with Egypt; it’s not something Netanyahu would lightly jeopardise'
- Security analyst
In what appears to be an indirect response to Egypt’s attempt to secure its border, recent unconfirmedreportsin the Israeli media suggest that Israel has considered freezing its $35bn natural gas deal with Egypt.
According to the reports, Israel would cite “violations” of the peace treaty linked to Egypt’s deployment of extra troops in Sinai. Neither government has commented publicly on the claims.
A security analyst, who asked to be unnamed for security reasons, suggested to MEE that the reports are less about energy policy than political leverage.
“The gas deal is Israel’s largest ever with Egypt; it’s not something Netanyahu would lightly jeopardise,” the analyst said.
“But by hinting at freezing it, he is sending a signal: accept a mass influx of Palestinians into North Sinai after a full invasion of Gaza or pay the price economically,” the analyst added.
“It’s about coercion, not commerce. Netanyahu knows Egypt is already dealing with an energy shortfall. Threatening to block gas supplies aims to force Cairo into decisions it has so far turned down.”

U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is blocking America's closest intelligence allies from receiving updates on Russia-Ukraine peace talks in a shock move that upends decades of tight cooperation.
That effectively cuts America's Five Eyes partners — the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand — out of the loop, stunning the intelligence community that has relied on the network since the end of World War II.
In a July 20 directive signed by Gabbard,reported by CBS, the U.S. intelligence community was given orders to classify all analysis and information related to the Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations as ""NOFORN,"" or no foreign dissemination, meaning the information cannot be shared with any other country or foreign nationals.
While it carved out exceptions for diplomatic channels and battlefield intelligence for Ukraine, it strikingly excludes sharing from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, one of the closest spy networks in the world.
""When you talk about Five Eyes, you're talking about a lot of integrated systems and capabilities,"" said Philip Davies, director of the Brunel Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies in London.
Davies added that there has been a lot of speculation that sharing with the U.S. is being dialed down by the other four members because of ""the vagaries of the Trump administration.""
The move by Gabbard is the second major curb on intelligence-sharing by President Donald Trump's administration this year. In March, the U.S.abruptly cut Kyiv offin a bid to pressure Ukraine into talks with Russia. That move rattled Europe’s spy chiefs, who quickly convened in Paris to ramp up their own support to Ukraine — including beefing up intelligence from European satellites.
Meanwhile, earlier this weekThe Wall Street Journal reportedthat the U.S. could once again use intelligence-sharing as a pressure mechanism to encourage Kyiv to agree to a potentially disadvantageous deal with Moscow.
“It is quite a sad read,” one European intelligence official said of the latest Gabbard decision, after being granted anonymity to speak candidly. “We don’t feel it yet, but it is not a good direction. It is said [Gabbard] is strongly pro-Russian.”
Trump’s behavior has added momentum to intelligence being part of Europe’s push for strategic autonomy and reducing reliance on the U.S. This spring's suspension of battlefield information — crucial for Ukrainian soldiers — was the final push many in Europe’s services needed to begin to shed decades of siloed thinking and start working toward joint intelligence that not only informs national governments but feeds directly into policy debates in Brussels.
One sign of this shifting climate came on April 11 at the annual Single Intelligence Analysis Capacity meeting in Brussels chaired by the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas. While in the past the event was often skipped by national intelligence heads, this year's meeting was attended by senior European spy chiefs.
On Wednesday, Gabbard separatelyannounced plansto overhaul her office, cutting hundreds of staff and consolidating teams focused on countering malign influence and cyber threats.
The Commission president wants to clean house with a review of legislative proposals that have become stuck in negotiations.
Confusion reigns over whether Moscow was behind the incident.
The plane also had an electronic backup system using radio beams that enabled it to land — no paper maps required — Bulgarian authorities found.
The European Commission president’s trip comes on the heels of an announcement by Germany’s Rheinmetall that it plans two new factories in Bulgaria, making the country Europe’s largest gunpowder manufacturer."

Quote:""I have no reason to believe Putin on any point. He will only be willing to negotiate if it is to his advantage. At the moment, by continuing the war, he has all the advantages on his side, from his point of view. He is securing territorial gains.

He sees how other heads of state and government around the world, I'll just mention Shanghai as an example, are dealing with him at conferences.""
Details:Merz was clear that in order to change the Kremlin's position, conditions must be created that would force Russia to seek a way out of the war. In his opinion, this can primarily be done by economic means – by exhausting Russia's war economy.
Quote:""At the moment, he [Putin] has absolutely no reason to come to a ceasefire or even a peace agreement. We have to create the reason. Militarily, that will be difficult, but economically it can be done. We must ensure that Russia is no longer in a position to maintain its war economy.""
Details:As an example, Merz suggested introducing tariffs for countries that continue to trade actively with Russia.

Published:September 05, 2025 at 5:33AM EDT
OTTAWA -- The Canadian economy lost jobs for the second month in a row and the unemployment rate climbed to its highest level since May 2016, excluding the pandemic period, Statistics Canada reported on Friday.
The weaker-than-expected reading of the labour market prompted financial markets to increase the odds the Bank of Canada will cut its key interest rate target later this month.
The unemployment rate ticked up to 7.1 per cent in August as the economy lost 66,000 jobs for the month. The monthly jobs report comes after the July labour force survey that showed a loss of 41,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 6.9 per cent.
A poll of economists heading into the release had expected August to show a gain of 10,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to rise to seven per cent for the month, according to LSEG Data & Analytics.
Leslie Preston, managing director and senior economist at TD, said the unemployment rate has now risen half a percentage point since the start of the year, but noted it could have been worse.
“Looking at that unemployment rate of 7.1 per cent, it would be even higher if we weren’t simultaneously having a slowdown in labour force growth,” she said.
“We had 31,000 fewer people in the labour force this month. So if we hadn’t had that, the unemployment rate would be even higher.”
The Canadian economy has been under pressure from the tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump.
While exporters have been adapting to ensure their goods are eligible to enter the U.S. tariff-free under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement on trade, the steel, aluminum and auto sectors continue to face specific tariffs.
Royal Bank senior economist Claire Fan said the trade dispute is taking its toll on Canadian labour markets.
“The worsening trend in the summer also mirrors condition south of the border -- job growth in the U.S. largely ground to a halt since May and the unemployment rate has also edged higher,” Fan wrote in a report.
While the weak job numbers help make the case for rate cuts, the August inflation figures to be released on Sept. 16, the day before the next Bank of Canada interest rate decision, are expected to weigh heavily on the policymakers at the central bank.
Preston said TD’s expectation is that the Bank of Canada will cut its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point twice by the end of the year, but the timing of that is less clear.
“The Bank Canada did act somewhat pre-emptively early in the year, cutting interest rates two times, and they’ve been on hold since then. They are wary of doing too much and potentially kicking off a bout of higher inflation,” she said.
Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics suggested the jobs report makes a September rate cut by the Bank of Canada “almost certain.”
“A September cut from the Bank of Canada looks almost nailed on, with the prospect of another cut before the end of the year looking increasingly likely too,” Ryan wrote in a report.
Statistics Canada said Friday there were 60,000 part-time jobs lost in August, while the economy shed 6,000 full-time jobs.
Employment fell across several industries in August.
The professional, scientific and technical services industry lost 26,000 jobs, while transportation and warehousing lost 23,000 positions and the manufacturing sector lost 19,000 jobs.
The construction industry added 17,000 jobs.
Average hourly wages rose 3.2 per cent on a year-over-year basis in August, following a year-over-year gain of 3.3 per cent in July.
The Bank of Canada’s next interest rate decision is set for Sept. 17.

The UN postal cooperation agency said it is working on “the rapid development of a new technical solution that will help get mail moving to the United States again”.

GENEVA – Postal traffic to the United States plunged more than 80 per cent following Washington’s imposition of new tariffs, with 88 operators worldwide fully or partially suspending services, the Universal Postal Union (UPU) said on Sept 6.
The UPU, the United Nations’ postal cooperation agency, is working on “the rapid development of a new technical solution that will help get mail moving to the United States again”, its director-general Masahiko Metoki said in a statement.
US President Donald Trump’s administration announced in late July that it was abolishing atax exemption on small packagesentering the United States from Aug 29.
tax exemption on small packages
The move sparked a flurry of announcements from postal services, including in Australia, Britain, France, Germany, India, Italy and Japan,that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted.
that most US-bound packages would no longer be accepted
The UPU said data exchanged between postal operators via its electronic network showed that traffic to the United States was down 81 per cent on Aug 29, compared to a week earlier.
“Furthermore, 88 postal operators informed the UPU they have suspended some or all postal services to the US until a solution is implemented,” it said.
These included operators in 78 UN member states – including two in Bosnia and Herzegovina – and in nine other territories including Macau and the Cook Islands.
The US changes places the burden of customs duty collection and remittance on transport carriers or “qualified parties” approved by the US Customs and Border Protection agency.
“Carriers, such as airlines, signalled they were unwilling or unable to bear this responsibility,” while postal operators had not yet established links to those approved parties, “causing major operational disruptions”, said the UPU.
The UN agency said it was working on a “Delivered Duty Paid” solution which will soon be integrated into its customs declaration platform.
It enables post operators “to calculate and collect the required duties from customers at origin”, the agency said.
In the meantime, the UPU said that, as of Sept 5, postal operators could access a calculator via a software interface that can be plugged into their retail and counter systems.
Mr Metoki has written to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to convey member countries’ concerns surrounding the upheaval.
UPU figures show that over the past 12 months, inbound traffic to the United States, from all categories of mail, comprised 15 per cent of global postal traffic.
Of that, 44 per cent came from Europe, 30 per cent from Asia, and 26 per cent from the rest of the world.
The majority was likely to be small packages – the international mail product most often used for e-commerce goods, said the UPU.
Based in the Swiss capital Bern, the UPU was established in 1874 and counts 192 member states. It sets the rules for international mail exchanges and makes recommendations to improve services. AFP

BANGKOK (AP) —Anutin Charnvirakul, a veteran politician best known for successfully lobbying todecriminalize cannabisin Thailand, became the country’s prime minister after receiving a royal endorsement Sunday.
Anutin, 58, succeedsPaetongtarn Shinawatraof the Pheu Thai Party, who wasdismissed last weekafter being found guilty of ethics violations overa politically compromising phone callwith neighboring Cambodia’s Senate President Hun Sen.
The phone call took place before a border dispute between the two nations turned into a deadlyfive-day armed conflict in Julythat raised fears of a full-blown war in the region.
Thailand’s new prime minister served in Paetongtarn’s Cabinet as a deputy prime minister and an interior minister, but resigned from his positions and withdrew his party from her coalition government after news of the leaked phone call caused public uproar.

Anutin received a letter of appointment in a ceremony at his Bhumjaithai Party’s headquarters in Bangkok, attended by senior members of parties expected to join his coalition government. They wore white civil servants’ uniforms used for royal and state ceremonies.
“I’d like to take an oath that I determine to perform my duties to my fullest capabilities, with honesty and virtue,” he read out a statement after receiving the endorsement.
Speaking to reporters after the ceremony, Anutin said his government will seek to address the country’s urgent problems, including the economy, the border conflict with Cambodia, natural disasters and crimes.
He also said he will commit to an earlier promise he made to rewrite the constitution and call an early election “to return power to the people to decide on the future of the country.”
He won the vote in Parliament on Friday with support from the main opposition People’s Party. In exchange for their votes, Anutin has promised to dissolve Parliament within four months and organize a referendum on the drafting of a new constitution by an elected constituent assembly.
The People’s Party said it would remain part of the opposition, leaving the new government potentially a minority one. The party, which runs on progressive platforms, has long sought changes to the constitution, imposed during a military government, saying they want to make it more democratic.
Pheu Thai said after Anutin won the vote that it would become an opposition party.
Anutin successfully petitioned forthe decriminalization of cannabis, which happened in 2022. There was a backlash against the policy and cannabis is now being morestrictly regulated. He was also a health minister during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was accused of tardiness in obtaining vaccine supplies.
During the Pheu Thai-led government, he has been embroiled in scandals, including suspected collusion in last year’s Senate election to give an unfair advantage to some candidates, and a land dispute involving property claimed by the state that has belonged to the family of his Bhumjaithai mentor, Newin Chidchob.
Anutin became the third prime minister of Thailand in two years after the 2023 general elections. The People’s Party, then named the Move Forward Party, won the most seats but was kept from power when military-appointed senators, who were strong supporters of Thailand’s royalist conservative establishment, voted against the party’s candidate because they opposed its policy seeking reforms to the monarchy.
The Senate no longer holds the right to take part in the vote to elect a prime minister.
The Pheu Thai Party, which at the time came second in the elections, later had one of its candidates, real estate executiveSrettha Thavisin, approved as prime minister to lead acoalition government. But he served just a year before the Constitutional Court dismissed him from office for ethical violations.
Srettha’s replacement, Paetongtarn, the daughter of formerPrime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, also lasted just a year in office. Her government was already greatly weakened when the Bhumjaithai Party abandoned her coalition in June.

Officials deny it had military features",Barma1eo,2025-09-06 23:47:02,71,5,N/A,N/A,N/A,"In Poland, in a field near the village of Majdan-Sełce in Lublin Voivodeship, about 50 km from the border with Ukraine, a “Gerbera” decoy drone crashed.
The fall of the unidentified object was reported bytvn24.
According to the spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, “it did not have any military characteristics.”
However, visually, this unidentified object is a Russian-made “Gerbera” decoy drone, used to overload air defense systems during attacks on Ukraine.
One of the photos clearly shows pre-flight inspection markings — a so-called check-up — on a fragment of the drone:
The date of the inspection is also visible — September 2, marked as “2.09”. The large letters “БГ” stand for the Russian abbreviation “боеготовый” (combat-ready).
The other markings with letters and plus signs next to them indicate the operability of each system (power supply, etc.).
Another photo shows a two-cylinder engine identical to those previously found in “Gerbera” drones in Ukraine, along with a number of other identical structural elements:
As for the drone’s silhouette, it can also be recognized by the distinctive geometry of the “Gerbera” and various construction features typical of the Russian decoy drone:
It should be recalled that this is not the first incident of Russian drones and even missiles entering Polish airspace. The most recent case occurred on August 20, 2025.
At that time, a Russian “Shahed” attack drone remained in Polish airspace forabout two and a half hours before crashing.
The crash site was 200 km from the border with Ukraine, in the village of Osiny, just 40 km from Poland’s capital, Warsaw.

September 8, 2025 / 4:00 PM EDT/ CBS/AP
Banksy, the famously anonymous street artist, unveiled a new mural at the Royal Courts of Justice in London on Monday. Shortly after, authorities said it would be removed.
The mural is of a judge appearing to beat a protester lying on the ground with a gavel. The protester is holding a blank sign with splattered red paint, seemingly depicting blood.
Banksy posted a photo of the workon Instagram, his usual method of claiming a work as authentic. It was captioned ""Royal Courts Of Justice. London.""
Security officials outside the courthouse covered the artwork Monday with sheets of black plastic and two metal barriers, and it was being guarded by two officers and a security camera.
Because the Victorian Gothic revival style building is 143 years old, the mural will be removed with consideration for its historical significance, according to HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS).
""The Royal Courts of Justice is a listed building and HMCTS are obliged to maintain its original character,"" it said in a statement. Listed buildings are considered the country's most significant historic buildings and sites and are protected by law.
While the artwork doesn't refer to a particular cause or incident, activists saw it as a reference to the U.K. government's ban on the group Palestine Action. On Saturday, almost 900 people werearrested at a London protestchallenging the ban.
Defend Our Juries, the group that organized the protest, said ina statement on social mediathat the mural ""powerfully depicts the brutality unleashed"" by the government ban.
""When the law is used as a tool to crush civil liberties, it does not extinguish dissent, it strengthens it,"" the statement read.
The courts have weighed in on thePalestine Actioncase, with judges initially rejecting the organization's request to appeal its ban. A High Court judge then allowed the appeal to go forward, though the government is now challenging that decision.
Banksy began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world's best-known artists. His paintings and installations sell for millions of dollars at auction and have drawn thieves and vandals.
The artist's anonymity was about avoiding problems with the police, Steve Lazarides, an early associate of Banksy's in Bristol,told CBS Newsin 2023.
But people have speculated about his identity for decades — Bristol artist Robin Gunningham and Robert Del Naja, from the band Massive Attack, also from Bristol, have been raised as possibilities.
Banksy alsorevealed his first nameas Robbie in a lost BBC interview recorded in 2003, the broadcaster said in 2023.
Banksy's work often comments on political issues, with many of his pieces criticizing government policy on migration and war.
At the Glastonbury Festival last year, an inflatable raft holding dummies of migrants in life jackets was unveiled during a band's headline set. Banksy appeared to claim the stunt, which was thought to symbolize small boat crossings of migrants in the English Channel, in a post on Instagram.
The artist has also taken his message on migration to Europe.
In 2019,""The Migrant Child,""depicting a shipwrecked child holding a pink smoke bomb and wearing a life jacket, was unveiled in Venice, Italy. In 2018, a number of works, including one near a former center for migrants that depicted a child spray-painting wallpaper over a swastika, were discovered in Paris.
Banksy has also created numerous artworks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the years, including one depicting a girl conducting a body search on an Israeli soldier, another showing a dove wearing a flak jacket, and a masked protester hurling a bouquet of flowers. He designed the ""Walled Off Hotel"" guesthouse in Bethlehem, which closed in October 2023.
Last summer, Banksy captured London's attention withan animal-themed collection, which concluded with a mural of a gorilla appearing to hold up the entrance gate to London Zoo.
For nine days straight, Banksy-created creatures — from a mountain goat perched on a building buttress to piranhas circling a police guard post to a rhinoceros mounting a car — showed up in unlikely locations around the city.

One of the Gaza-bound vessels carrying aid and pro-Palestinian activists including Greta Thunberg was struck by a drone, the flotilla organisers have claimed.
Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF)posted footage on Instagramthat appeared to show the Portuguese-flagged vessel being hit by an object, and said all six passengers and crew were safe after the incident outside the Tunisian port of Sidi Bou Said.
Tunisian authorities quoted by Reuters said reports a drone was involved ""had no basis in truth"", adding an initial inspection indicated the explosion originated inside the vessel.
The humanitarian aid flotilla set sail from Barcelona last week, andarrived in Tunisia on Sunday.
The GSF said their ""Family boat"" was struck in Tunisian waters, and fire had damaged the main deck.
In a series of videos published to their Instagram, spokespeople for the GSF said an ""incendiary device"" caused a fire onboard the vessel, which the crew was able to extinguish.
A spokesperson for the Tunisian national guard also told the AFP news agency ""no drone"" had been detected and the investigation was continuing.
BBC Verify has authenticated several videos of a claimed strike on the ""Family"" vessel off the coast of Tunisia.
David Heathcote, Head of Intelligence at McKenzie Intelligence Services, told the BBC the nature of the impact angle in footage implies ""that the object has been dropped, rather than launched or fired"".
""If so, it could be that a drone was used to manoeuvre over the ship before the package was released on to it,"" he said.
""Regardless of the method of delivery, the impact video casts serious doubt on the Tunisian authorities' version of events,"" Mr Heathcote added.
United Nations Human Rights Council special rapporteur and Tunisian resident Francesca Albanese, who was also featured in videos shared by the GSF, said that if an attack could be verified it would be an ""assault and aggression against Tunisia, and Tunisian sovereignty"".
In a post to 'X', she said she was at Sidi Bou Said port and ""trying to figure out the facts with local authorities"".
Albanese has been a prominent critic of Israel's military offensive in Gaza, and has been subject to sanctions imposed by the US in July - a decision welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who called them a ""firm measure against the mendacious smear campaign"" against Israel.
Flotilla organisers have said the aim of their mission is to ""break Israel's illegal siege on Gaza"", but have faced several setbacks.
In June, Israeli forces boarded a boat carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza and detained the 12 activists onboard, including Swedish activist Thunberg.
Israeli authorities escorted the activists to the port of Ashdod before deporting them from the country.
Israeli authorities have characterised the attempts to sail aid to Gaza as publicity stunts that offered no real humanitarian assistance.
There have also been prior allegations of drone attacks on aid ships bound for Gaza; the Freedom Flotilla alleged that its ship The Conscience was struck by a drone in May off the coast of Malta.
The BBC was sent a recording of the distress call from the flotilla ship, recorded by a crew member on a nearby oil tanker. The captain of the flotilla ship can be heard reporting drone strikes and a fire onboard.
The Maltese government said everyone aboard the ship was ""confirmed safe"" and that a fire onboard the ship was ""brought under control overnight"".
Last month a UN-backed body confirmed that there was famine in Gaza and the UN's humanitarian chief said it was the direct result of Israel's ""systematic obstruction"" of aid entering Gaza.
The report was labelled an ""outright lie"" by Israel, which has denied there is starvation in the territory.
In March, it introduced a nearly three-month total blockade on supplies entering the Strip, claiming the aid was being taken by Hamas.
It started allowing a limited amount of aid back into the territory after increasing international pressure.
Israel has since tried to impose its own distribution system through the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been criticised by aid agencies.
In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 people when they boarded Turkish ship Mavi Marmara which was leading an aid flotilla towards Gaza.
The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.
At least 64,522 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."

🚨😭 PELOSI SNAPS OVER INSIDER TRADING QUESTION
Nancy Pelosi went full meltdown mode on CNN when Jake Tapper dared to read Trump’s comment accusing her of getting rich off insider info.
“Why do you have to read that?” she barked, mid-interview, while trying to steer the convo back to Medicaid’s birthday party.
Tapper gave her a chance to respond. Pelosi gave viewers a lecture: Her trades are “obvious.”
Her husband’s trades? Also fine. And if you think otherwise, it’s “ridiculous.”
But wait….Senate Dems just backed Josh Hawley’s stock ban bill.
You know, the one originally called the PELOSI Act?
Sounds like someone’s feeling the pressure.
Cheers to Tears of the Left!

President Donald Trump on Sunday defended a massive immigration raid by federal agents on an electric-vehicle manufacturing site in Georgia operated by South Korean automaker Hyundai. South Korea says it has reached a deal with the U.S. for the release of detained South Korean workers.
The South Korean government announced Sunday that 300 workers who were detained after a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released video of Thursday’s large-scale immigration raid at a site where Hyundai manufactures electric vehicles in Georgia, where federal agents detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — More than 300 South Korean workers detained following a massiveimmigration raidat a Hyundai plant in Georgia will be released and brought home, the South Korean government announced Sunday.
Kang Hoon-sik, chief of staff for President Lee Jae Myung, said South Korea and the U.S. had finalized negotiations on the workers’ release. He said South Korea plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home as soon as remaining administrative steps are completed.
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said that Seoul and Washington are discussing details on allowing all the detained workers to return on a voluntary basis. It said Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is to leave for the U.S. on Monday afternoon for talks related to the workers’ releases.

U.S. immigration authorities said Friday they detained 475 people, most of them South Korean nationals, whenhundreds of federal agents raidedHyundai’s sprawling manufacturing site in Georgia where the Korean automaker makes electric vehicles. Agents focused on a plant that is still under construction at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution toproduce batteriesthat power EVs.
Cho said that more than300 South Koreans were among the detained.
The operation was the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration’smass deportation agenda. But the one Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and because the targeted site has been touted as Georgia’s largest economic development project.

The raid stunned many in South Korea because the country is a key U.S. ally. It agreed in July to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy and make a $350 billion investment in the U.S. in return for the U.S lowering tariff rates. About two weeks ago, U.S. President Donald Trump and Lee held theirfirst meeting in Washington.
Trump said perhaps the U.S. could work out an arrangement with South Korean workers who would train U.S. citizens to do work such as battery and computer manufacturing.
“If you don’t have people in this country right now that know about batteries, maybe we should help them along and let some people come in and train our people,” Trump said Sunday night at Andrews Air Force Base. He added that “the way you train people is bring people in that know what they’re doing, let them stay for a little while and help.”
Lee said the rights of South Korean nationals and economic activities of South Korean companies must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement procedures. South Korea’s Foreign Ministry separately issued a statement to express “concern and regret” over the case and sent diplomats to the site.
Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist.
Most of the people detained were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None has been charged with any crimes yet, Steven Schrank, the lead Georgia agent of Homeland Security Investigations, said during a news conference Friday, adding that the investigation was ongoing.
He said that some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others had entered the country legally but had expired visas or had entered on a visa waiver that prohibited them from working.
Kang, the South Korean presidential chief of staff, said that South Korea will push to review and improve visa systems for those traveling to the U.S. on business trips for investment projects.

Police stand in front of a banner reading in Spanish ""Uribe guilty"" displayed by opponents of former President Alvaro Uribe outside the court where a verdict is expected in his trial for witness tampering in Bogota, Colombia, on July 28, 2025.Fernando Vergara/APhide caption
BOGOTA, Colombia — Former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was convicted of witness tampering and bribery Monday in a historic trial that gripped the South American nation and threatened to tarnish the conservative strongman's legacy.
The ruling followed a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that Uribe attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law-and-order leader of having links to a paramilitary group founded by ranchers in the 1990s.
Uribe, 73, was not in court in the capital, Bogota, for the verdict as the judge has so far not ordered his arrest. He followed the ruling from his home outside Medellin but did not immediately speak about it.
Uribe faces up to 12 years in prison but a sentencing will be delivered in a separate hearing. He is expected to appeal the ruling.
The former president, who governed from 2002 to 2010 with strong support from the United States, is a polarizing figure in Colombia, where many credit him for saving the country from becoming a failed state, while others associate him with human rights violations and the rise of paramilitary groups in the 1990s.
While the ruling was read, Uribe's opponents clashed briefly with his supporters outside the courthouse.
In a ruling that lasted more than 10 hours, Judge Sandra Heredia said there was enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer to coax three former members of paramilitary groups who were in prison into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a left-wing senator who had launched an investigation into Uribe's alleged ties to a paramilitary group.
The case dates to 2012, when Uribe filed a libel suit against Cepeda with the Supreme Court. But in a twist, the high court dismissed the charges against Cepeda and began investigating Uribe in 2018.
During Uribe's presidency, Colombia's military attained some of its biggest battlefield victories against Latin America's oldest leftist insurgency, pushing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia into remote pockets and forcing the group's leadership into peace talks that led to the disarmament of more than 13,000 fighters in 2016.
Known for his tireless work ethic and short temper, Uribe still has legions of followers in Colombia and is one of the fiercest opponents of the current president, former leftist guerrilla Gustavo Petro.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio reacted to the ruling, as it became evident that Judge Heredia was going to find the former president guilty of bribery.
""Uribe's only crime has been to tirelessly fight and defend his homeland"" Rubio wrote on Monday on X. ""The weaponization of Colombia's judicial branch by radical judges has now set a worrisome precedent.""
Colombian President Gustavo Petro defended the ruling, writing on X that ""a strong justice system"" will enable Colombia to emerge from violence. He added in another message that Rubio was interfering with Colombia's sovereignty.
""The world must respect the judges of Colombia"" Petro wrote.
Heredia said that her ruling should not be interpreted as ""a victory for anyone"" but as ""an act of justice.""
Critics also blame Uribe for state crimes. According to a truth commission created in 2017, more than 6,400 civilians were executed by the Colombian military and identified as members of rebel groups by soldiers seeking promotions during the conflict, in a phenomenon that peaked during the Uribe administration.
Prosecutors accused Uribe of sending lawyers to meet with imprisoned former paramilitary henchmen and pressure them to drop testimony that they had provided to Senator Cepeda.
During the trial, Uribe denied trying to flip witnesses but acknowledged seeking interviews with the men as part of his preparation for trial and to verify testimonies that were also being used in a murder trial against his brother, Santiago Uribe, who was also accused of ties to the armed paramilitaries.
Cepeda spoke to journalists after the ruling, and said that he would continue to fight for ""truth and justice"" for victims of Colombia's conflict. ""No one can defy and taint the rule of law,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Jeffrey Epstein’s imprisoned former girlfriend repeatedly denied to the Justice Department witnessing any sexually inappropriate interactions with Donald Trump, according to records released Friday meant to distance the Republican president from the disgraced financier.

Maxwell Interview Transcript Day 2.cft (Redacted)
The Trump administration issued hundreds of pages of transcripts from interviews that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche conducted with Ghislaine Maxwell last month as the administration was scrambling to present itself as transparent amid a fierce backlash over an earlier refusal to disclose a trove of records from the sex-trafficking case.

The records show Maxwell repeatedly showering Trump with praise and denying under questioning from Blanche that she had observed Trump engaged in any form of sexual behavior. The administration was presumably eager to make such denials public at a time when the president has faced questions about a long-ago friendship with Epstein and as his administration has endured continued scrutiny over its handling of evidence from the case.
The transcript disclosure represents the latest Trump administration effort to repair self-inflicted political wounds after failing to deliver on expectations that its own officials had created through conspiracy theories and bold pronouncements that never came to pass. By making public two days worth of interviews, officials appear to be hoping to at least temporarily keep at bay sustained anger from Trump’s base even as they send Congress evidence that they had previously kept from view.
“I actually never saw the President in any type of massage setting,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”

Maxwell recalled knowing about Trump and possibly meeting him for the first time in 1990, when her newspaper magnate father, Robert Maxwell, was the owner of the New York Daily News.
She estimated that she hadn’t seen Trump since the mid-2000s, again in a social setting. Asked if she ever heard Epstein or anyone else say Trump “had done anything inappropriate with masseuses” or anyone else in their orbit, Maxwell replied, “Absolutely never, in any context.”
Maxwell, a onetime socialite who was convicted in 2021 of helping lure teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, was interviewed over the course of two days last month by Blanche at a Florida courthouse.
Blanche prefaced the interview by saying Maxwell had been given limited immunity, allowing her to speak freely without fear of prosecution for anything she said. The only exceptions, he said, were if she lied or gave statements inconsistent with what she’d previously said.
READ MORE:Ghislaine Maxwell transferred to minimum-security prison camp in Texas
After her interview, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida where she had been serving a 20-year sentence to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons have explained the reason for the move.
The Epstein case had long captured public attention in part because of the wealthy financer’s social connections over the years to prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Trump, who has said his relationship with Epstein ended years before. Epstein was arrested in 2019 on sex-trafficking charges, accused of sexually abusing dozens of teenage girls, and was found dead a month later in a New York jail cell in what investigators described as a suicide.
The saga has consumed the Trump administration over the last month following an abrupt two-page announcement from the FBI and Justice Department that Epstein had killed himself despite conspiracy theories to the contrary, that a “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi had intimated was on her desk did not actually exist and that no additional documents from the high-profile investigation were suitable to be released.
The announcement produced outrage from conspiracy theorists, online sleuths and Trump supporters who had been hoping to see proof of a government coverup. That expectation was driven in part by comments from officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Dan Bongino, who on podcasts before taking their current positions had repeatedly promoted the idea that damaging details about prominent people were being withheld.
Patel, for instance, said in at least one podcast interview before becoming director that Epstein’s “black book” was under the “direct control of the director of the FBI.”
The administration had an early stumble in February when far-right influencers were invited to the White House in February and provided by Bondi with binders marked “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” and “Declassified” that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain.
After the first release fell flat, Bondi said officials were poring over a “truckload” of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI and raised expectations of forthcoming releases.
But after a weekslong review of evidence in the government’s possession, the Justice Department said last month that no “further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.” The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims and “only a fraction” of it “would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.”
Faced with fury from his base, Trump sought to quickly turn the page, shutting down questioning of Bondi about Epstein at a White House Cabinet meeting and deriding as “weaklings” supporters who he said were falling for the “Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”
The kerfuffle also created bitter divisions within the administration, as Bondi and Bongino angrily clashed at a White House meeting last month. Bongino was uncharacteristically silent on social media for several days after that.

Caregiving
The program, which will start in November and is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually, is available to all residents regardless of income.

In an unprecedented move, New Mexico is making child care free.
Beginning in November, it will be the first state in the nation to provide child care to all residents regardless of income, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced this week.
The state has been working to lower child care care costs since 2019, when it created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department and started to expand eligibility for universal child care. This latest changeremoves income eligibility requirementsfrom the state’s child care assistance program altogether and waives all family copayments.
The 19th thanks our sponsors.Become one.
The initiative is expected to save families $12,000 per child annually.
“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” Lujan Grisham said in her announcement. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”
The United States allocates some federal funding to states to lower the cost of child care for low-income kids, but eligibility for that funding is very limited and by and large, most families are paying an average of$13,000on child care annually. It’s much higher in many states.
In the absence of a federal universal child care system, some states have worked to build their own systems, and New Mexico has been a leader in that effort over the past several years.
The state’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department got a budget increase of $113 million in the most recent legislative session, taking its total operating budget to nearly $1 billion. Half of that money goes specifically to child care payment support.
The state also established a fund in 2020 with money earmarked for early childhood education. Thanks to tax collections from the oil and gas industries, the fund has grown from $320 million to $10 billion.Latinas in New Mexicoled the charge in 2022 to help pass a constitutional amendment in 2022 that ensured a portion of that fund went specifically to universal child care. Funding for the new initiative will come at least in part from there, and Lujan Grisham will also be requesting an additional $120 million in state funding next year, a spokesperson for the governor said.
The news also comes with improvements for child care facilities and, potentially, raises for their staff. As part of the rollout, the state will establish a $13 million loan fund to construct and expand facilities, launch a recruitment campaign for home-based providers and incentivize programs to pay staff a minimum of $18 an hour.
The state hopes the initiative will lead to the creation of 55 new child care centers and 1,120 home-based child care options.
Still, response to the initiative so far has been mixed. Republican state Rep. Rebecca Dowtold the Albuquerque Journalthat she believes child care vouchers should be reserved for children most at risk for child abuse and neglect. Since the state’s child care assistance program expanded eligibility over the past five years, fewer low-income families have participated in the program, the Journal reported.
But Thora Walsh Padilla, the president of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, praised the initiative, saying during a press conference Monday that it addresses various challenges the tribe has struggled with, including raising wages for providers. There are only three child care facilities on the 463,000 acre reservation.
“It is so timely and it answers so many needs,” she said. “A building? Oh my goodness, we’ll be one of the first to apply.”

Addressing the country’s parliament, Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said there were 19 intrusions of its airspace, and that a “large proportion” of the drones entered it from Belarus.
He announced that Poland has invoked Article 4 of NATO, meaning the alliance’s main political decision-making body will meet to discuss the situation and its next steps.
Tusk called the incident an “unprecedented violation of (its) airspace” and said it lasted all night – from just before midnight local time on Tuesday until 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday.
Polish media reported that debris from one of the drones hit a residential building in the village of Wyryki in eastern Poland, near the border with both Ukraine and Belarus. Photographs from the scene geolocated by CNN show extensive damage to a family house there.
No injuries were reported, according to Polish media.
Another piece of a drone was discovered near a cemetery in Cześniki in Zamość County, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Wyryki, according to a statement from the local prosecutor’s office.
Tusk said it was the first time Russian drones had been shot down over the territory of a NATO member state and the incursion involved a “huge number” of them.
“We are most likely dealing with a large-scale provocation,” Tusk said on Polish television, following an emergency meeting of the country’s National Security Bureau.
He said the “situation is serious” and that Poland was “ready to repel” this type of attack.
“The security of our homeland is our highest priority,” Polish President Karol Nawrocki said.
Poland is a member of NATO, the transatlantic defense pact involving the United States that employs the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all.
Europeanfaith in the reliability of that alliance has been shakenunder US President Donald Trump who, alongside key cabinet members, have called on Europe to lead in its own defense.
NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said its chief Mark Rutte was in touch with the Polish leadership and that NATO itself was “closely consulting” with Poland.
The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called the incident “the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began.” Kallas said that the “indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,” adding that: “Russia’s war is escalating, not ending.”
The Polish military thanked NATO member the Netherlands for contributing F-35 fighter jets to defensive operations overnight, which have now concluded.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said at least eight “Shahed” drones had been aimed toward Poland, in what he called “an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.” His own country endured a Russian attack involving 415 drones and 40 missiles overnight.
The leader of the newest NATO member, Sweden, called the presence of Russian drones over Poland “unacceptable.”
“The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine poses a threat to the security of all of Europe,” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a post on X.
“Russia is deliberately expanding its aggression, posing an ever-growing threat to Europe,” said GitanasNauseda, the president of Lithuania, also a NATO member.
The incursion comes as Trump’s attempts to strike a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine have ground to a halt, with Moscow only scaling up its aerial assaults.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “testing the West.”
“Russian drones flying into Poland during the massive attack on Ukraine show that Putin’s sense of impunity keeps growing,” Sybiha said in a post on X.
Ned Price, a US State Department spokesperson during the Biden administration, also thought Russia may have sent drones over Poland to test NATO resolve and defenses.
While cautioning it could be the case that the drones flew over Poland by mistake or because of Ukrainian countermeasures, Price told CNN’s Laura Coates their presence, if deliberate, could expose what Russia might see as “weakness.”
US Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, was more direct.
“Repeated violations of NATO airspace by Russian drones are fair warning that… Putin is testing our resolve to protect Poland and the Baltic nations,” Durbin said in a post on X.
Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Territorial Defense forces had been activated to search for downed drones.
He urged people to “remain calm” and said anyone who found fragments of military equipment should report it to authorities.
Earlier, authorities closed airspace over Warsaw International Airport and other smaller airports “due to unplanned military activity related to ensuring state security,” according to a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) posted on the US Federal Aviation Administration’s website.
The Warsaw airport reopened Wednesday morning, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said in a post on X.
The military activity over Poland comes less than a week after Putin was in China, where hemet with leader Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Unin show of unity between the authoritarian allies.
Since then, Russia has staged its largest aerial assaults on Ukraine since it fully invaded its neighbor more than three years ago.
The recent attacks have largely targeted residential areas around the country and in the capital of Kyiv. On Tuesday,24 civilians were killedin a Russian strike on the village of Yarova in the easternDonetsk region, Ukrainian officials said.
Last weekend, Russia deployed more than 800 drones inits largest attack to date, striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time.
The attack hit the Cabinet of Ministers building, which houses the prime minister’s office, as well as some government ministries.
All these attacks have come less than a month after Putin’s summit with Trump in Alaska that ended without a deal to end the war. Any progress made has long since evaporated with Russia’s expanded aerial attacks.
Poland earlier announced it was closing its eastern border with Russian ally Belarus, due to joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises beginning Friday, Reuters reported.
The Zapad 25 large-scale exercises, which will take place in western Russia and Belarus, have raised security concerns not only in Poland but also in the neighboring NATO countries on Lithuania and Latvia, according to Reuters.
“On Friday, Russian-Belarusian maneuvers, very aggressive from a military doctrine perspective, begin in Belarus, very close to the Polish border,” Prime Minister Tusk told a government meeting, Reuters reported.
“Therefore, for national security reasons, we will close the border with Belarus, including railway crossings, in connection with the Zapad maneuvers on Thursday at midnight,” Tusk said.
CNN’s Chris Lau, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.

Welsh III announced Monday evening that the dean and department head overseeing a children’s literature course at the center of a viral recording were going to be removed, saying they approved plans to teach material inconsistent with the published course description.
The announcement came after a video circulated online Monday showing a student confronting a professor over LGBTQ-related content in the class, sparking backlash from Republican lawmakers and calls for investigations, a response from the U.S. Department of Justice, and a statement from the Texas A&M System chancellor pledging to discipline the professor.

“Our students use the published information in the course catalog to make important decisions about the courses they take in pursuit of their degrees,” Welsh said in astatementposted to X, formerly known as Twitter, late Monday. “If we allow different course content to be taught from what is advertised, we let our students down. When it comes to our academic offerings, we must keep our word to our students and to the state of Texas.”
It was not immediately clear on Monday whether the College of Arts and Sciences dean or department head will remain employed at the university in other roles.

Welsh’s announcement marks a sharp turn from his comments captured in one of the clips circulated Monday, in which he told a student upset about the content that “firing” the professor was “not happening.” His statement follows mounting political pressure from Republican lawmakers, including Texas Rep.Brian Harrison, R-Midlothian, who postedthe clipsonline and called on state and federal officials to investigate.
Also Monday night, Texas A&M System ChancellorGlenn Hegarsaid he would work with the Board of Regents to discipline a professor after the video drew national attention.
“It is unacceptable for A&M System faculty to push a personal political agenda,” Hegar said in a statement. “We have been tasked with training the next generation of teachers and childcare professionals. That responsibility should prioritize protecting children, not engaging in indoctrination.”
News from around the state of Texas.
The video, which does not show anyone’s face, captures audio of a student objecting to a professor teaching that there are more than two genders. The student says this conflicts with President Donald J. Trump’sexecutive orderand her religious beliefs, and the professor responds that she has a right to teach the lesson and the student has a right to leave. It is unclear when the video was shot, and Texas A&M officials have not identified the student or the professor involved.
In one of the video clips circulated on Monday, Welsh can be heard asking the student, “What do you expect us to do? Fire her?” When the student replies, “Yes,” Welsh responds, “Well, that’s not happening.”
Several Republican lawmakers have since called for Welsh’s removal, and Harmeet K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, who wrote on X that the incident was “deeply concerning” and said the agency would “look into” it. The Justice Department and Texas A&M University officials did not immediately respond to questions or provide additional information about the incident on Monday.
Hegar said an initial review found that the professor “failed to comply with clear instructions to align course descriptions with course materials, adding that similar issues “continue to be an issue with this professor.” Chris Bryan, Texas A&M System spokesperson, declined to provide additional information Monday.
Harrison, a Texas A&M alum and former Trump administration official, has clashed with Welsh for months over diversity, equity and inclusion policies. In May, heaccusedTexas A&M of “egregious discrimination” by offering DEI-related courses and “targeted student recruitment.” Welsh has denied violating the law or discriminating.
Abbottthreatenedto fire Welsh in January over the university’s decision to attend a conference hosted by The PhD Project, an organization that seeks to increase diversity in classrooms and corporations. Welsh defended the decision as legally permissible under the state’s DEI ban, but later reversed course and the university did not participate.
Welsh became Texas A&M’s presidentin 2023, the same year Texas lawmakers passed a ban on DEI offices and programs at public universities. He took over after the resignation of former President M. Katherine Banks, and since then, Republican leaders have moved aggressively to assert more control over higher education.
This incident also comes as public universities prepare to implement Senate Bill 37, a new law taking effect Jan. 1 that gives regents more power over curricula. It directs regents to review their schools’ curriculum periodically and to consolidate or eliminate low enrollment programs, a move critics warn could be used to target programs unpopular with the Texas Legislature’s conservative majority."
reddit,r/news/,https://www.thetimes.com/world/europe/article/france-protest-general-strike-z6gzms09t,t3_1nd200n,Let’s block everything: protesters plan to ‘pull the brake’ on France,romainguimard,2025-09-10 02:07:03,678,105,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Like many of his compatriots, Julien Marissiaux, a website designer from northern France, has had enough: of rising prices and taxes, worsening public services and, above all, what he sees as a self-serving political class topped by President Emmanuel Macron that has lost touch with the people.
“The whole system is rotten to the core,” he told me last week as we sat in the co-operative café he set up eight years ago in an abandoned building in Morbecque, a town of 2,500 people near the Belgian border. “The overwhelming majority of the French people do not feel they are being represented any more.”
Rather than just grumble, Marissiaux, 43, is determined to do something to change the system — or at least to havea try. The loquacious father of two is among the instigators of a day of action that aims to bring France to a halt on Wednesday, involving everything from strikes and protests to consumer boycotts, namedBloquons Tout(Let’s block everything).
“Our strategy is to create a hydra, a multi-headed hydra, so you can’t simply cut off its head,” Marissiaux said, explaining the lack of a single leader of the movement, which is namedLes Essentiels(the Essentials).
Their inspiration is Coluche, the late comedian turned social activist, whose red clown’s nose may become the symbol of the movement — just as thegilets jaunes(yellow vests) gave their name to the last big social upheaval to shake up France in 2018 during the early part of Macron’s first term.
The action, planned for countless towns and cities across France, is unlikely to provide comic relief for the president, however. It comes in a week expected to begin with the ousting of François Bayrou — the fourth prime minister since the start of 2024 — with both the left and the far right planning to join forces to defeat the 74-year-old in a parliamentary vote.
The immediate cause of Bayrou’s woes is economic: more specifically, resistance to his plans for €44 billion in spending cuts torein in the public financesafter more than half a century in which the French state has consistently failed to balance the books.
“For months France has been discovering the situation that I have been highlighting for years: that it is drowning in debt,” the prime minister declared last week in one of a series of radio and television interviews intended to hammer home his message.
More fundamental, however, is an underlying national malaise that can seem inexplicable to outsiders but which has undoubtedly gathered pace under Macron, especially during the upheavals of the Covid lockdowns and subsequent inflation, followed by the geopolitical uncertainty of war in Ukraine and the return of President Trump. Call it the “French Paradox”.
For the more than 100 million people or so who visit France each year — more than any other place on the planet — the country has long been synonymous with glorious weather and scenery, good food and wine, and the best high-speed rail network in Europe.
Long vying with the UK to be the sixth-largest economy in the world, it is also known for its dominance of the global fashion industry, network of nuclear power stations and prowess in cars and aeronautics. Macron’s attempts to turn France into “la start-up nation’’, though widely mocked by critics, have also borne some fruit, helping to encourage banks and other companies to Paris from London.
Many of the French themselves appear to see their country differently, however, with a traditional national grumpiness giving way to what one recent poll described as “a collective depression”.
About 66 per cent of the people questioned by the pollsters Viavoice believe their country is in decline, especially its healthcare and education systems and its welfare state — all of which were once the envy of its neighbours. And that was even before the current bout of political turbulence.
“To understand this collective depression, it is difficult to refer solely to an accumulation of individual difficulties, or to the economic and social constraints weighing on France,” the study’s authors concluded. It could be better explained instead by a “feeling of lost identity”.
A perceived decline in law and order, fuelled by the spread and growing power of drug gangs way beyond their traditional heartland in suburbs of Paris and Marseilles, is the major preoccupation of the French, ahead of inflation, according to another survey, by Ipsos.
Such national gloom explains the rapid spread of the discontent expressed by those behind the protests planned for Wednesday, largely on TikTok, Facebook and other social media platforms, many of them from Paris and other big cities in what has been dubbedla France périphérique.
•Why is youth violence exploding in fragile French cities?
Marissiaux had already been formulating ideas among people he sat with in his café, which is modelled on thecafés philosophiques,informal places of discussion that became fashionable in France during the 1990s. “The kind of place where we try to see the glass as half full and not half empty and try to achieve a dynamic that is different from what we see around us,” he said.
The decisive moment, Marissiaux explained, came on July 14, the French national day, when he came across a short audio clip posted on TikTok entitled “Open letter to the people of France” in which an anonymous male voice urged people “to pull the emergency brake” to bring the country to a standstill on September 10.
Recognising a fellow spirit, Marissiaux got in touch with the clip’s originator, who turned out to be a struggling 46-year-old small businesswoman named Christelle, from the Var region, more than 600 miles to the south, whose surname has not been made public. The voice was generated by AI, she revealed: she feared if people heard a woman speaking, they would scroll past.
Together they hammered out a programme whose revolutionary if inchoate demands include a slashing of the income and power of the country’s elites and an end to political parties and their replacement by a form of direct democracy based on local referendums. They also want a “Frexit” from the European Union.
Coluche is a fitting symbol: an embodiment of revolt and solidarity, he launched a satirical bid to contest the 1981 presidential election, only to pull out under pressure from François Mitterrand, the socialist who eventually won.
Coluche went on to establish a network of food kitchens for the poor. His death five years later in a motorcycle crash aged just 46 continues to fuel conspiracy theories. Marissiaux is among those who doubt it was an accident.
Their movement got a boost on July 15, when Bayrou announced his programme of spending cuts, which sparked particular outrage by calling for the abolition of two of France’s 11 annual public holidays. “I don’t watch TV, I didn’t even know he was going to announce his budget the next day,” Christelle told a French magazine that tracked her down.
She and Marissiaux aim to achieve their goals not by taking to the streets but rather by locking themselves down at home, drawing out large amounts of cash and boycotting debit cards and supermarkets in favour of small shops. “September 10 is just the first day,” he said.
Others that have jumped on their bandwagon have a more traditional vision of how to proceed. The planned actions of another nebulous group,Indignons-Nous(Let’s get outraged), include blocking railway stations, refineries and major roads and occupying roundabouts — which will be more visible and more immediately disruptive. Marissiaux and his allies will not be joining them.
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, has publicly supported calls for a general blockade and a general strike on that day.
At the other end of the political spectrum, Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, which sees itself as the party of law and order, is steering clear — even though some of its leading figures have expressed sympathy for those who could be hit by Bayrou’s spending cuts.
Whether those behind the various actions will succeed in “stopping” France on Wednesday is not clear. A leaked document by the intelligence services has warned of violence and sabotage, though Bayrou has dismissed the predicted turnout of 100,000 as “fairly low for French society”.
Memories of thegilets jaunesmovement remain fresh, however, on both sides of the French barricades. It, too, began on social media, as a grassroots protest against a planned hike in the tax on diesel, but quickly grew into abroader societal revoltthat caused major disruption from November 2018 until well into the following spring — and only petered out after concessions by the government that cost several billion pounds.
Who will actually be running France by then is also not clear. Barring a surprise last-minute deal with his opponents, Bayrou looks set to be defeated in Monday’s vote.
Macron could then potentially dissolve parliament, though this would likely be a last resort. He is instead thought to be considering asking the Socialists, under Olivier Faure, 57, to attempt to form a government, which might scrape together a narrow majority with the help of Macron’s own centrist Renaissance party and some of the centre-right Republicans.
But they too will be confronted with the samegrim economic realityas Bayrou — and by the need to tackle the public finances.
At 5.8 per cent of GDP, France’s budget deficit is the third biggest in the EU, while the country’s accumulated debt is surpassed only by that of Greece and Italy — pushing up its borrowing costs on the international markets. Government spending already accounts for 57 per cent of GDP — compared with 44.2 per cent in the UK — making further tax rises difficult.
Despite likely attempts to raise the burden on the corporate sector and the rich, a left-leaning prime minister will find, like Bayrou, that some spending cuts at least will be unavoidable.
France’s collective depression, it seems, may not be as paradoxical as it appears.

LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A Michigan judge dismissed criminal charges Tuesday against a group of people who were accused of attempting to falsely certify President Donald Trump as the winner of the 2020 election in the battleground state, a major blow to prosecutors as similar cases in four other states have been muddied with setbacks.
District Court Judge Kristen D. Simmons said in a court hearing that the 15 Republicans accused will not face trial. The case has dragged through the courts since Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat,announced the charges over two years ago.
Simmons said she saw no intent to commit fraud in the defendants’ actions. Whether they were “right, wrong or indifferent,” they “seriously believed” there were problems with the election, the judge said.
“I believe they were executing their constitutional right to seek redress,” Simmons said.
Each member of the group, which includeda few high profile membersof the Republican Party in Michigan, faced eight charges of forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. The top felony charges carried a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
Supporters, friends and family crowded in the hallway outside the courtroom cheered when the judge said the cases would be dismissed. Defendants leaving the courtroom cried and hugged friends and family. One woman wept as she hugged another and said, “We did it.”

Investigatorssaid the group met at the Michigan GOP headquarters in December of 2020 and signed a document falsely stating they were the state’s “duly elected and qualified electors.” President Joe Biden won Michigan by nearly 155,000 votes, a result confirmed by a GOP-led state Senateinvestigationin 2021.
Electorsare part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects the president of the United States. In 48 states, electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote. In Nebraska and Maine, elector votes are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.
One man accused in the Michigan casehad the charges against him droppedafter he agreed to cooperate with the state attorney general’s office in October 2023. The other 15 defendants pleaded not guilty and have maintained that their actions were not illegal.
Prominent Michigan MAGA activist and former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Meshawn Maddock was one of the accused. Her attorney, Nicholas Somberg, told reporters after the hearing that the case brought by the attorney general’s office was a waste of money and a “malicious prosecution.”
“There needs to be major consequences for the people who brought this,” he said.
“We all knew from day one that we had done nothing illegal or wrong,” Maddock said in a written statement. “Yes, we volunteered to be an Alternate Elector in support of Donald J. Trump. That is not a crime, as much as Nessel wanted it to be one.”
Nessel called Simmons’ ruling “disappointing” and a “very wrong decision” during a virtual news conference and said evidence would support criminal charges if the case had been brought before a jury. She said the group members knew their actions did not follow proper election procedure and specifically sought to circumvent the rules.
“They knew they were not electors,” Nessel said of the group. “They knew Donald Trump lost, but then they lied anyway. And that is a crime.”
Nessel said her office is considering appealing the decision to a higher court, which she could do. But the legal threshold to overturn the ruling is high under Michigan law and would center on whether Simmons abused her discretion in dismissing the charges after hearing evidence.
Simmons, who was originally appointed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2019 and reelected to her nonpartisan position the next year, took nearly a year to say whether there was sufficient evidence to bring the cases to trial following a series oflengthy preliminary hearings. In her remarks Tuesday, Simmons said the case was not about who won the 2020 election, but about the intent of the people charged.
“This is not an election interference case,” she said.
The judge noted that the group appeared in public about the effort and posed for photos after the meeting.
“Typically people who are seeking to defraud or deceive the public do not gather and make a spectacle. That would be weird,” Simmons said, prompting chuckles in the courtroom.
The judge said Maddock appeared to have direct contact with the Trump campaign and that she could have entertained her culpability, but Maddock’s public statements at the time led the judge to believe she was seeking “redress” from her state senators in presenting them with an “alternate” choice of electors.
“The prosecution would like the court to believe that these named defendants were savvy or sophisticated enough to understand fully the electoral process,” Simmons said in the hearing. “This alternate document doesn’t state it’s an official document of the state of Michigan, doesn’t contain a certificate of vote, no one attempted to forge the governor’s signature, no one attempted to create a fake seal.”
Kahla Crino, an assistant attorney general, contested the judge’s finding on intent, saying to reporters that the group was aligned with the actual language of the document they signed, it was not contingent on the election results and it “directly impaired on legitimate government function.”
Around two dozen people gathered outside of the courtroom Tuesday morning, bearing signs in support of the defendants. One read, “End political lawfare.” Defendants and their lawyers crowded into a small courtroom in downtown Lansing for the hearing, with a handful appearing over a video call. Two of the defendants’ attorneys said their clients could not appear because of medical reasons. Most of the accused are over the age of 70.
Outside court after the hearing, Republican state Rep. Matt Maddock, husband to Meshawn Maddock, promised “retribution” against the attorney general.
“They’re going to pay for what they did to these people,” he told reporters.
Marian Sheridan, one of the people charged, said her life has been on hold for two years as she waited for the judge’s decision. She insists the plan was to act as a “backup.”
“I’ve always been proud of my reputation,” she said. “In such a short time, you have friends and family who believe somehow that you are a criminal.”
Prosecutors inNevada,Georgia,WisconsinandArizonahave also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme. None of the cases have neared the trial stage and many have been bogged down by procedural and appellate delays.
The effort to secure fake electors was central to thefederal indictmentagainst Trump that wasabandonedearlier this year shortly before Trump took office for his second term.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/10/junk-food-upf-more-children-obese-than-underweight-unicef,t3_1nd7bca,Junk food leads to more children being obese than underweight for first time,biwook,2025-09-10 07:01:36,135,29,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Cheap ultra-processed food behind rise in overweight children, with one in 10 now obese globally, says Unicef
More children around the world are obese than underweight for the first time, according to a UN report that warns ultra-processed junk food is overwhelming childhood diets.
There are 188 million teenagers and school-age children with obesity – one in 10 – Unicef said, affecting health and development and bringing a risk of life-threatening diseases.
Catherine Russell, executive director of the UN agency for children, said: “When we talk about malnutrition, we are no longer just talking about underweight children.
“Obesity is a growing concern. Ultra-processed food [UPF] is increasingly replacing fruits, vegetables and protein at a time when nutrition plays a critical role in children’s growth, cognitive development and mental health.”
While 9.2% of five to 19-year-olds worldwide are underweight, 9.4% are considered obese, the report found. In 2000, nearly 13% were underweight and just 3% were obese.
Obesity has overtaken being underweight as the more prevalent form of malnutrition in all regions of the world except sub-SaharanAfricaand South Asia, and is a problem even in countries with high numbers of children suffering from wasting or stunting due to a lack of food.
The report,Feeding Profit: How Food Environments are Failing Children, used data from more than 190 countries and sources including Unicef, the World Health Organization and the World Bank.
It revealed that one in five of those aged between five and 19 are overweight, with a growing proportion of those 291 million individuals falling into the obese category: 42% in 2022, up from 30% in 2000.
Obesity was highest in Pacific Island countries, where there has been “a shift from traditional diets to cheap, energy-dense, imported food”, the report found. In Niue, 38% of five to 19-year-olds are obese, and the figure is 37% in theCook Islands. Rates were also high in richer countries, such as Chile (27%), the US (21%) and the United Arab Emirates (21%).
In the UK, the percentage of overweight children increased from 29% in 2000 to 30% in 2022, while the percentage with obesity rose from 9% to 11%.
The steepest rise in numbers of overweight schoolchildren and teenagers was in low- and middle-income countries, where the number has more than doubled since 2000, amid a corresponding rapid expansion of “modern retail outlets, online grocery stores and food delivery apps”, with UPFs being “relatively cheaper than fresh or minimally processed nutritious foods”.
Childhood obesity has been linked to higher risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers in later life.
There is growing international concern about the damaginghealth impacts of UPFs, which include cereals, biscuits and cakes, fizzy drinks and ready meals, which have been through industrial processes and include additives such as colours, emulsifiers and flavours, and can be high in added sugar, fat or salt.
UPFs “dominate shops and schools”, the report warned, and are heavily promoted to young people and parents digitally, creating an environment where they are hard to avoid, rather than a matter of personal choice.
Nomathemba Chandiwana, chief scientific officer at the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation in Cape Town,South Africa, said: “We often only think of malnutrition here as underweight or stunting, but obesity has the same long-term consequences.
“About one in eight children are overweight or have obesity, while one in four are stunted. That double burden is shaping a generation’s health,” she said, adding that children were targeted by “relentless” marketing of fast food,even in schools.
“It’s really tough trying to tackle both undernutrition and obesity at the same time. South Africa is a middle-income country, but still deeply unequal. Many children grow up both hungry and surrounded by cheap, poor-quality food.
“Most of the attention and resources go to undernutrition and stunting in the early years, which of course matters, but obesity isn’t always seen as malnutrition, so it slips under the radar,” she said.
Growing rates of childhood obesity will have a major impact economically. The World Obesity Federation has previously estimated thatby 2035, the global cost of overweight and obesity will surpass $4tn (£2.9tn) annually.
The report highlighted the positive action of Mexico’s ban on the sale and distribution of UPFs in schools.
But it added that “the unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments”.
Unicef called on governments to act on this by using labelling, marketing restrictions, taxes and subsidies. It suggested banning junk foods and their marketing in schools, and better programmes for vulnerable families to afford nutritious diets.
There should be “strong safeguards to protect public-policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry”, it said.
This article was amended on 10 September 2025. We had attributed a study that estimated the global annual cost of obesity would surpass $4tn by 2035 to Unicef, whereas in fact it was by the The World Obesity Federation."

Engineers with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) also told advisory committee members they have found even earlier signs that the building in Surfside was failing months before the collapse that killed 98 people.
Watch NBC6 free wherever you are
In retrospect, it seems, Champlain Towers South was trying to tell us something months before collapse: that it was in distress.
For the first time, leaders of the probe showed photos of a sliding glass door that could have been one of those signs.
It broke twice, with one side “stuck in a nearly closed position and (could) not be used for approximately one month before the collapse of the building,” said Judith Mitrani-Reiser, the lead investigator.
The engineers stressed that a stuck sliding glass door does not mean your building is going to collapse.
But, in the case of Champlain Towers, it was not the only sign.
As previously reported, Meiser continued, “in early June 2021, just three weeks before the failure of Champlain Towers South, severe distress was noted in … a masonry planter wall and planter box supported on the pool deck.”
Last year, NBC6 Investigates spoke to an engineer who believes the pool deck collapsed around a column closest to that point -- one of the weakest spots on the deck, the government-funded engineers have confirmed.
And there was more: a gate along the same line just a bit farther south became jammed and unusable as one side of it sank by as much as one inch one week before disaster struck.
The night before, an eyewitness described seeing a water leak that grew from a drip to a steady flow over the next few hours, the investigators reported.
Minutes before collapse, a section of wall on the south end of the property also failed.
In sum, Mitrani-Reiser said, “There were many events of distress occurring across the pool deck and the street level parking decks for days, weeks, a month and even years before the collapse of Champlain Towers South. These early signs of distress were all concentrated in the pool deck and street level parking deck area with much concentration near previously repaired cracks and along construction joints.”
That has led engineers searching for the initiating failure that led to collapse to now focus on the first suspect – a connection between the pool deck and one or more supporting columns – as the prime suspect.
The project’s associate lead investigator, Glenn Bell, repeated a previous finding that the pool deck was designed so badly, some areas had less than half of the strength required by the building code.  That, combined with improper placement of steel bars (called reinforcement) within the concrete, made the deck even more vulnerable to failure, he said.
“Design understrength and misplaced slab reinforcement caused the bulk of the problems,” he said. “These two conditions existed from the time construction was completed 40 years before the partial collapse.”
“Combined with the evidence that Judy described of slab distress in the days, weeks and months before the failure indicate that it is more likely that the failure started in a pool deck slab-column connection than we considered in June,” Bell concluded.
When NIST makes its recommendations, perhaps sometime next summer, committee members suggested they include how to spot distress before it’s too late.
“The missed opportunities represented by some of these precursors,” Bell said, “it happens far too common, and I think a lot of it goes back to the need for education of people responsible for managing buildings and even those who may be more casual or lay observers.”
Mitrani-Reiser agreed but noted those warning signals are much clearer in hindsight.
“It's easy for us here, after the collapse, to go back and look at all of this evidence and say, ‘Oh, there was this, and there was that’… But, you know, you see something, say something. Raise observations to your building manager.”
But, engineers said, there’s no need to panic thinking every crack in concrete is a sign of impending disaster.
As always in disasters like this, they say, there is more than just one cause.
The public may not see their detailed findings until next spring, approaching five years from the day Surfside and much of South Florida will never forget."
reddit,r/news/,https://abcnews.go.com/US/lsd-shows-early-promise-potential-anxiety-treatment/story?id=125267546,t3_1n8rsw5,LSD shows early promise as a potential anxiety treatment,NewSlinger,2025-09-05 01:09:07,5715,546,N/A,N/A,N/A,"The study enrolled 198 adults with anxiety at 22 sites across the U.S.
Once a symbol of 1960s counterculture, the drug lysergic acid diethylamide, commonly known as LSD, is emerging from research labs as a possible treatment for anxiety.
Preliminary trial results published in the medical journalJAMAsuggest that a single dose of MM120, an oral pharmaceutical formulation of LSD, can significantly reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), offering a potential alternative to daily medications.
However, experts caution that these are early results, and many treatments that show promise in preliminary trials don't always succeed in later studies.
Dr. Maurizio Fava, chair of the department of psychiatry at Mass General Brigham and Slater Family professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, was a senior author on the study. He contrasted MM120 with existing medications.
""All the treatments we currently have for generalized anxiety require daily medication, which means daily side effects,"" Fava told ABC News. ""Here, we see a single administration with side effects largely limited to the day of dosing, followed by benefits that last for weeks.""
Fava serves as an adviser to MindMed, the company that sponsored the trial, but said he receives no direct funding from the company.
Harriet De Wit, PhD, professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience at the University of Chicago, praised the rigor of the research.
""It's a very impressive study. It has four dose conditions, plus placebo, in a large number of subjects with well-balanced groups. The investigators are experts at clinical trial design, and I was very struck by the results,"" she said.
The study enrolled 198 adults with moderate to severe anxiety at 22 sites across the U.S. Participants received either one dose of MM120 at different strengths or a placebo, and their symptoms were tracked for 12 weeks with a standard anxiety scale.
The strongest improvements came at the 100 and 200 microgram doses, with patients improving by about five to six points more than placebo. Benefits lasted up to three months after just one treatment.
Fava pointed out that the study was designed in a way that made it harder to show a benefit, because participants knew there was a good chance they would get LSD, which likely increased the placebo effect.
""Despite a significant placebo response, there was still a clear, robust difference at the higher LSD doses,"" he said.
Unlike most psychedelic studies, this trial deliberately excluded therapy alongside the medication.
""What's most remarkable about this study is that it did not involve any significant psychotherapy. That suggests the drug itself has long-lasting anti-anxiety effects,"" De Wit said.
At the higher doses, most people had brief hallucinations or visual distortions, along with some nausea and headaches. Serious side effects were rare.
""All 40 people assigned to the 200-microgram dose reported perceptual changes. That may be part of the therapeutic effect -- we don't know. But it wasn't necessarily an adverse effect,"" De Wit said.
Still, LSD's long duration -- often eight to twelve hours -- poses challenges for clinical use.
""For safety reasons, I feel very strongly that drugs with psychedelic properties should be administered in a healthcare clinic, not at home,"" Fava cautioned.
For decades, LSD was regarded primarily as a risky hallucinogen, but attitudes are shifting as evidence builds for its potential medical uses, De Wit noted.
""It's very impressive that a single administration had effects lasting eight or even 12 weeks. But these participants were carefully screened. We need to know how safe it is in broader populations,"" she said.
Fava stressed the need for larger trials to confirm the study's results and noted that phase 3 trials are already underway.
Meanwhile, De Wit praised the current research as a step in the right direction.
"" ... there should be more studies like this,"" she said.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yvpx20le2o,t3_1n8alkh,Surgeon admits fraud over amputation of own legs,NewSlinger,2025-09-04 13:47:27,5708,491,N/A,N/A,N/A,"An NHS vascular surgeon who had his own legs removed has been jailed for two years and eight months for insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography.
Neil Hopper, 49, of Truro, Cornwall, carried out hundreds of amputation operations before having his own legs removed in 2019.
Truro Crown Court heard he lied to insurers by claiming that injuries to his legs were the result of sepsis and not self-inflicted.
It heard that in May 2019 Hopper had below knee amputations after a ""mysterious illness"". In fact he had used ice and dry ice to freeze his own legs so they had to be removed, said prosecutor Nicholas Lee.
The court heard Hopper, who admitted two counts of fraud and three of possessing extreme pornography, had a ""sexual interest in amputation"".
Judge James Adkin said in sentencing that he accepted that Hopper, who had no previous convictions, was remorseful.
However, the ""level of harm"" in three videos of body mutilation which were the subject of the pornography charges, was ""exceptionally high"", he said.
Hopper had both legs amputated after complaining that his feet were in pain.
He was treated for suspected sepsis before he was told by surgeons that he should have his legs amputated and he was operated on.
He did not tell the medics the real cause of his injuries, the court heard.
The fraudulent insurance claims from two firms totalled more than £466,000 the court heard.
Hopper had been tempted by ""greed"" said Mr Lee.
He had messaged a friend about the claims saying he should ""milk it"", the court heard.
He ""enjoyed"" the interest from the media in his case, Mr Lee told the court.
""His motivations were a combination of obsession with removing parts of his own body and a sexual interest in doing so,"" he said.
""It seems to have been a long-standing ambition of his,"" he said.
After the amputations, he was back at work in just under six months with prosthetic legs.
He was arrested in March 2023 and has been suspended from the medical register since December 2023.
Andrew Langdon, KC, said in mitigation, that the offences had been a ""shock"" to friends.
He said: ""He [Hopper] has been committed to working to the service of others.
""The whole saga is very difficult to comprehend.""
The extreme pornography offences were connected to videos of body mutilations that Hopper had purchased online and did not include children, the court heard.
Hopper was identified following investigations into Marius Gustavson who ran the EunuchMaker website.
Mr Lee told the court that Hopper had bought three videos from the website for £10 and £35, respectively, showing men willingly having their genitals removed.
He also exchanged about 1,500 messages with Gustavson about his own lower leg amputations and how he had done it, including asking how much dry ice he used.
Gustavson was jailed for lifewith a minimum term of 22 years at the Old Bailey in 2024 for leading an extreme body modification ring.
Hopper had suffered body dysphoria since childhood and his feet were an ""unwelcome extra"" and a ""persisting never-ending discomfort"" to him, said Mr Langdon.
Hopper did not regret the operations, but ""bitterly regrets"" the ""dishonesty"" about their cause, he said.
After the operations, Hopper had been ""totally overwhelmed by support from friends and family which made it even more difficult to tell them what had really happened"".
Hopper, who is originally from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, had been employed by the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust (RCHT) from 2013 until he was arrested in March 2023.
A spokesperson for the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust said after the case that the convictions did not relate to Mr Hopper's ""professional conduct"" at its hospitals.
The trust had carried out ""comprehensive clinical reviews of surgery"" by Hopper, ""including engaging an experienced independent clinical expert to review decisions to operate"", they said.
""We want to reassure the public that our exhaustive investigations have found no evidence whatsoever to indicate any risk or harm to patients at our hospitals,"" they said.
Assistant Chief Constable Jim Pearce said after the case that Devon and Cornwall Police had ""worked closely"" with the trust and ""none of the criminal charges related to Hopper's professional conduct with no risk to patients he treated in his work at the hospital identified during the current police investigation"".
However, former patients of Hopper, including some who underwent amputations,  have contacted a South West-based medical negligence firm.
They said they were concerned about the treatment they received from Hopper, in light of the criminal charges brought against him.
Mike Bird, partner at Enable Law, said the case had caused ""shock and grave concern"" among his former patients.
""Some have had life-changing surgery and are now worried it was not really needed,"" Mr Bird said.
""While we understand that RCHT have said that the charges do not relate to his professional conduct and there is apparently no evidence suggesting any risk to patients, this is such a serious situation that there must be a rigorous public investigation.""
The Crown Prosecution Service said it would be making an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2022 to recover the money that Hopper acquired through the fraud.
Jason Abbot, 38, from Hayle, whose foot was amputated by Hopper in November 2022 after painful arthritis in an ankle, said he had no concerns about his care.
""He was great, very supportive of the situation, [he gave] me loads of information about it and told me to have a really good think about it and I did.""
He said he ""felt shocked"" that Hopper had been convicted.
""I never thought he would do anything like that.""
Hopper also worked at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, Wales, for a period of training in general surgery in 2011, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board has confirmed.
In an interview with the BBC in 2023 he also said he had worked in Swansea and Bangor.
The relevant health boards have been asked to confirm.

Nevada sheriffs are asking the public’s help in identifying a man killed on Saturday in an apparent homicide at theBurning Man festival.
In a statement on Monday, Pershing county sheriff Jerry Allen asked for assistance to identify the man, who was found dead in the futurist encampment of Black Rock City as the festival reaching its climax when an effigy – the eponymous burning man – was set alight.
“We are specifically looking to identify the white male adult decedent who is between the ages of 35 and 40, approximately 6 feet tall and 200 lbs, with short brown hair and facial hair,” Allen said in a statementreported by the Reno Gazette Journal.
The sheriff’s office are looking for any information from people who heard or saw anything between 8 and 9.30pm.
“We are also currently seeking information regarding any suspect identifiers for any person who would commit such a heinous crime against another human being,” Allen said. “At this time, no information is too small to disregard, so do not hesitate to contact my office.”
A murder investigation was launched on Sunday after a man was found “lying in a pool of blood” on Saturday night, police said. That came after a festival-goer alerted a police officer that a man was found “lying on the ground, obviously deceased”.
Part of the site was cordoned off as on-site police began investigating. Organizers with the Burning Man Project said it was cooperating with law enforcement. In a statement, Burning Man officials asked those still on the playa not to interfere with law enforcement.
“The safety and well-being of our community are paramount,” Burning Man said.Sheriff Allen said “several participants in the immediate area” were interviewed.“Although this act appears to be a singular crime, all participants should always be vigilant of their surroundings and acquaintances,” Allen warned.
“There is no further information available at this time but it will be released as appropriate to provide for communication, while still preserving the integrity of the complicated investigation of a crime in a city which will be gone by the middle of the week,” he added.
Burning Man has become the site of unexpected attention in recent years. In 2023, it was washed out by strong rain storm that turned the desert to mud, killing one person; this year, a dust storm tore temporary structures away, including one named the “orgy dome”.
The festival has previously experienced deaths, including when a man ran into the fire in 2017.
Last week, Burning Man co-founder John Law made a rude gesture when he was asked to describe the festival, saying it had strayed far from its late stage counter-culture origins in the 1980s.
“We were going to go out to the Black Rock Desert to just go crazy, and, you know, drive 100 miles an hour with the lights out, set bonfires and go up to the hot springs. We didn’t plan on bringing any art with us,” Law said.
But he broke with the festival in 1996 when it grew large and more commercialized.
“It’s a giant party for rich white people,”Law told SF Gate.“They’re selling the idea of freedom, and it’s not free. The whole philosophy, it’s a bunch of crap.” He added that the festival now demands conformity. “The star f–kers started coming around. It’s as clubby in its own way as the Elks or some hunting lodge in Minnesota.”"

‘He’s always on the attack’: the Brazilian judge prosecuting Bolsonaro inspires both love and hate
Jair Bolsonaro led a criminal organisation that sought to plunge Brazil back into dictatorship with a murderous power grab involving special forces assassins and a vast disinformation campaign, the supreme court judge presiding over the former president’s trial has claimed as he voted for Bolsonaro’s conviction.
Alexandre de Moraes was the first supreme court justice of five to announce his decision on Tuesday, as the trial of Bolsonaro and seven alleged co-conspirators – including four senior members of the military and the former head of Brazil’s answer to MI6 – entered its final stretch.
“The defendant, Jair Bolsonaro, was leader of this criminal structure,” the judge told a courtroom in the capital, Brasília, during a five-hour speech detailing what he called Bolsonaro’s “authoritarian project”.
Bolsonaro has denied involvement in a coup plot. But Moraes said there was “ample evidence” that the far-right populist, who governed the South American country from 2019 until the end of 2022, hadtried to cling to powerafter losing that year’s election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
“Brazil nearly went back to being a dictatorship … because a criminal organisation made up of a political group doesn’t know how to lose elections​,” Moraes told the court​. “Because a criminal organisation made up of a political group led by Jair Bolsonaro doesn’t understand that the alternation of power is a principle of republican democracy.”​
Later in the day, a second judge, Flávio Dino, also voted for Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices to be found guilty, although Dino argued that some of the defendants had higher levels of culpability than others. Bolsonaro’s level of guilt was “rather high”, the judge claimed, indicating he would support a tougher sentence for the former president.
Three more supreme court justices are due to cast their votes in the coming days, with Bolsonaro’s conviction widely considered a foregone conclusion. If found guilty of crimes including leading an armed criminal organisation and a coup d’etat and violently attempting to abolish Brazil’s democracy, the former president faces a sentence of up to 43 years. A verdict is expected by Thursday. While Bolsonaro has denied the charges, he has admitted seeking supposedly constitutional ways of remaining in power.
Explaining his vote, Moraes claimed the alleged coup plot began in June 2021, the third year of Bolsonaro’s government, when the then president and close allies launched a deliberate and criminal attempt to undermine Brazil’s electronic voting system and intimidate its judiciary by spreading “criminal lies” through a huge campaign of online disinformation. Their goal was to convince millions of Brazilians of the possibility of election fraud and justify an illegal power grab if Bolsonaro lost the presidential election in October 2022.
The conspiracy allegedly accelerated in November 2022, after Bolsonaro was narrowly defeated by Lula. In a series of post-election meetings with the leaders of the armed forces, Bolsonaro allegedly tried to convince them to stage a military intervention to prevent Lula from taking power. The head of the navy, who is also on trial this week, allegedly agreed while the army and air force commanders declined to take part. Moraes said the latter two deserved “respect and admiration” for helping thwart Bolsonaro’s alleged coup attempt.
At the same time, a parallel plot to cause social chaos by using a hit squad of special forces assassins to murder Lula, the vice-president-elect, Geraldo Alckmin, and Moraes also began to unfold, although it was allegedly aborted at the last minute.
That subplot – a copy of which Moraes said was printed out at the presidential palace by an army general and then delivered to the presidential residence – was supposedly intended to justify the imposition of a state of exception that would allow Bolsonaro to retain power.
“This [plan] wasn’t printed out in a cave. It wasn’t printed out hidden away in a room of terrorists. It was printed out in the presidential palace. It was printed out in the seat of the Brazilian government,” Moraes told the court, adding that he was certain Bolsonaro was aware of the plan. It was impossible to believe that the general who printed out the roadmap for the assassinations and took it to the presidential residence did so with the intention of using the document to make “a paper boat”, Moraes said.
The failed putsch allegedly culminated on 8 January 2023, one week after Lula’s inauguration, when hardcore Bolsonaro supporters ran riot in Brasília, vandalising the presidential palace, the congressional building and the supreme court building where this week’s trial is being held.
Bolsonaro has denied inciting those attacks, noting how he had flown to the US at the end of December 2022 to avoid having to hand the presidential sash to Lula. But Moraes rejected the former president’s attempts to distance himself from the violence. “When the mafia foot soldier commits a crime on the orders of the mafia capo, the head of the criminal organisation isn’t [physically] there. But he answers for [the crime] because he ordered it,” Moraes said.
“What happened on 8 January was not spontaneous combustion,” Moraes added. Rather, he said, it was the conclusion of a long-running plot to stay in power “at any cost” carried out by “a political group that, regrettably, transformed itself into a criminal organisation”.
That organisation of “criminal coup mongers”, led by Bolsonaro, hoped “to keep itself in power irrespective of the result of the elections”, Moraes said.
The judge also voted for the seven other defendants to be convicted. They include the former defence ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, the former minister for institutional security Gen Augusto Heleno, and the former navy commander Adm Almir Garnier Santos. The conviction of that quartet of military men would represent a historic moment for Brazil, where members of the military top brass have never before been held to account for staging a coup. All four men deny being part of the alleged power grab.
​Bolsonaro is under house arrest and did not attend Tuesday’s hearing. But his senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro​, said there was “no proof at all” of his father’s guilt and called claims that his father was involved in a plot to murder Moraes, Lula and Alckmin “fiction”."

The suspect in thefatal stabbing of a Ukrainian womanon Charlotte's light rail system late last month is now facing federal charges that would make him eligible for the death penalty, according to the Justice Department.
Decarlos Brown Jr., 34, who was arrested on Aug. 22 after he fatally stabbed 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska, was charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of North Carolina with committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system, which could make him eligible for the death penalty, the DOJ said on Tuesday.
""This brutal attack on an innocent woman simply trying to get to her destination is an attack on the American way of life. Of course, crimes like this affect the victim the most -- Iryna deserves justice, and we will bring justice to her and her family,"" U.S. Attorney Russ Ferguson said in a statement on Tuesday.
During a press conference on Tuesday, Ferguson described the incident as a ""terroristic act"" and said he and North Carolina FBI Special Agent James Barnacle Jr. spoke to Zarutska's mother and uncle to alert them of the federal charges. Ferguson said the family is ""suffering like any of us would be.""
""No one should sit in fear while on the light rail,"" Ferguson said as he held back tears.
The charges come after Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the city is now increasing security on commuter trains ""effective immediately,"" as the attack continues to spark outrage among elected officials.
""As I reflect on the tragic murder of Iryna Zarutska my heart continues to go out to her family and our community as we try to make sense of this horrific and senseless loss,"" Lyles said in astatementMonday evening.
Zartuska, who was previously living in a bomb shelter in Ukraine before coming to the U.S., was stabbed while riding the Lynx Blue Line in Charlotte, according to an affidavit obtained by ABC News. She had just finished work and was on her way home when she was ""brutally murdered,"" Ferguson said.
The recent release of the attack on video has caused national outrage, with U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffysaying the departmentis investigating the city and ""its failure to protect Iryna Zarutska.""
""If mayors can't keep their trains and buses safe, they don't deserve the taxpayers' money,"" Duffy said in apost shared to Xon Monday.
North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein also said he was ""appalled"" the the unprovoked murder.
""We need more cops on the beat to keep people safe,"" Stein said in a statement on Monday.
This comes after the Charlotte Area Transit System, or CATS, confirmed to ABC News there was not security on board the train at the time of the attack, with a spokesperson saying a security team ""patrols the system, they are not stationed in one area.""
""At the time of the incident they were riding on a train directly in front of where the incident occurred,"" a spokesperson for CATS told ABC News.
Lyles said ""effective immediately"" CATS security personnel will be ""re-deployed for a stronger presence on Blue Line platforms"" and police will also be ""increasing patrols at key areas across the transit system.""
""Residents across our community and visitors to our region depend on public transit. We owe it to them to make sure our public transit system and our city are safe and secure,"" Lyles said.
CATS will also be rolling out ""new safety operations including bike units and urban terrain vehicles"" over the next two to three weeks, Lyles said.
Zarutska boarded the train on the night of Aug. 22 and sat in an aisle seat directly in front of the suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown Jr., who is seen in a window seat wearing an orange sweatshirt.
The train travels for ""approximately four and a half minutes before the suspect pulls a knife out of his pocket, unfolds the knife, pauses, then stands up, and strikes at the victim three times,"" according to the affidavit obtained by ABC News.
Prior to the stabbing, there appeared to be ""no interaction between the victim and the defendant,"" the affidavit said.
Zarutska was pronounced dead at the scene and a witness directed officials to the location of the suspect, the affidavit said.
Brown was arrested after he was released from the hospital with ""non-life-threatening injuries sustained at the time of the incident"" and was charged with first-degree murder, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.
The 34-year-old suspect has a criminal record including larceny and breaking and entering charges. He also spent five years in prison for robbery with a dangerous weapon starting in 2015, according to the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction.
In total, Brown has been charged 14 times in the past, including an arrest in January, but was ""still on the streets"" leading up to the attack, Barnacle said.
Brown's next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 19, according to court records. It is unclear whether Brown has an attorney who can speak on his behalf.
Barnacle and Ferguson said they have not spoken to the White House about Brown's federal charges.
Officials said Zarutska, who had worked at a senior citizen center, a pizza place, took care of animals in the neighborhood and had just recently moved in with her partner, will be buried in the United States, even after the Ukrainian Embassy reached out to her family.
""No she loved America, we will bury her here,"" her family said, according to Ferguson.

A 13-year-old boy who may have ""idolized previous mass shooters"" has been arrested after police found a large collection of guns and ""mass shooting scenario"" writings at his Washington state home, authorities said.
Police were notified on Friday afternoon about the boy, who allegedly had ""school shooter ideations,"" ""was making threats to kill” and said he had access to guns, according to the sheriff's office in Pierce County, which encompasses Tacoma.
Police searched the boy’s home early Saturday morning. The sheriff's office said authorities found a ""large quantity"" of secured and unsecured guns; ""loaded magazines with school shooter writings on them;"" and clothes and writings that reinforce a ""typical mass shooting scenario.""
Deputy Carly Cappetto with the Pierce County Sheriff's Office told ABC News authorities found 23 firearms inside the home -- many of which appear to be homemade long guns using 3D printed parts.
The teenager has been charged with attempted threat to bomb/injure a school, unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of fireworks, according to court documents. He is due in court on Monday.
The boy's parents have not been charged at this time, according to Cappetto.
The teenager allegedly had social media posts dating back to June with photos of him holding guns as well as messaging that appeared to show a ""fascination of recent school shootings/mass casualty attacks,"" according to court documents. Police recovered posts that appeared to reference the 1999 Columbine High School mass shooting and the 2022 Uvalde, Texas, elementary school mass shooting, according to court documents.
Some AR-style magazines found at the boy's home “had writing on them referencing mass shootings, including Columbine,” the court documents said.
Materials for fireworks and explosives were also recovered at the house, documents said.
The boy is not currently enrolled in any school district, authorities said, noting that he last attended the Franklin Pierce School District in 2021.
A spokesperson for the Franklin Pierce School District told ABC News, ""We were notified by local law enforcement personnel that a young person in our community was arrested for allegedly planning a school shooting. ... We continue to work with the Pierce County Sheriff’s Office to ensure that this individual is not a threat to our schools or our community as a whole.""

California City Immigration Processing Center stands in the Kern County desert and awaits reopening as a federal immigrant detention facility in California City, Calif., on July 10, 2025.
Immigrant rights activists are warning that the Trump administration is transporting immigration detainees to a private prison in theCalifornia desertthat is operating illegally and could put detainees in danger.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement began transporting detainees on Aug. 29 to the California City Correctional Facility, located approximately 100 miles north of Los Angeles, and it’s now become a key part of the federal government’s deportation strategy, according to Marcela Hernandez, a director of organizing at Detention Watch Network.

“This opening is going to mean more violent raids across southern and northern California,” Hernandez said. She later added that “Anybody who gets targeted in the Bay Area or in northern California could be sent here.”
The California City facility is run by the private prison company CoreCivic. It formerly operated as a state corrections facility butdeactivatedin March 2024, according to the state. Now, it’s in the process of becomingthe largest immigration detention center in the state,with over 2,500 beds. Those beds could become vital to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown now thatthe U.S. Supreme Court has ruledimmigration raids can continue in LA.
Detention facilities have become a flash point across the country as the Trump administration ramps up itsviolent crackdownon immigrants. The city of Leavenworth, Kansas,has suedto try to block CoreCivic from reopening a prison in Leavenworth. The mayor of Newark, New Jersey,was arrested at a private detention facilitythat he said he was observing. And the infamous “Alligator Alcatraz” built hastily in Florida was ordered to be shut down after a court found it violated environmental and tribal laws, althougha higher court later ruledit could stay open while the lawsuit continues.

Dolores Huerta, a longtime labor activist in California,compared the California City facility to Alligatory Alcatrazand said it violated state and local laws. California law requires municipalities to give 180 days of public notice and hold public hearings prior to any immigration detention center opening. Hernandez said the city is in violation of that law, as it never conducted the required hearings, and that CoreCivic is currently operating without a permit.
Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, confirmed with SFGATE that the facility is now housing detainees from ICE and the United States Marshals Service. He did not say if the facility has a valid business license or if it’s in violation of California’s disclosure laws.
“We have submitted all required information for the business license and continue to maintain open lines of communication with city officials,” Gustin said.
The facility failed a fire department inspection in July,according to KQED, and local residents are concerned that the facility would strain the city’s water supplies. In July, City Manager Christopher Lopez wrote a letter to CoreCivic telling the company they could not legally operate and that there were safety concerns, according to theBakersfield Californian.

California City’s government has largely declined to comment in recent weeks about the facility. Duringa Planning Commission meeting on Sept. 2, Commissioner David Brottlund said that the commission “has no authority” over the current proposal for the facility. Christy Lopez, the city’s acting attorney, said during the meeting that the company “is taking a different approach to opening the detention facility” and that the city is now reviewing an updated application.
Neither City Manager Lopez nor Brottlund returned SFGATE’s requests for comment.
CoreCivic appears to be continuing to activate the facility. The Department of Homeland Security has given ita contract worth up to $13.5 millionfor the California City center, and the companycurrently has 13 job openingsfor the center.

PUNTA ARENAS, Chile — An American social media influencer who has been stuck in a Chilean airbase in Antarctica for two monthsafter landing a plane there without permissionwas released Saturday back to the mainland, where he was to pay $30,000 in penalties.
Ethan Guo, who was 19 when he began his fundraising mission for cancer research, was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents.
But he was detained after Chilean authorities said he lied to officials by providing authorities with ""false flight plan data."" Prosecutors said he had been authorized to only fly over Punta Arenas in southern Chile but that he kept going south, heading for Antarctica in his Cessna 182Q — a single-engine light aircraft known for its versatility.
After he landed in Chile's Antarctic territory on June 28, he was detained in a military base amid legal negotiations between his lawyers and the government. Guo, who is originally from Tennessee and turned 20 in July, spent two months living in the base with limited communications and freezing Antarctic winter temperatures plunging below zero.
He was released by a Chilean judge on the condition that he donate the tens of thousands of dollars raised to a childhood cancer foundation within 30 days and leave the country as soon as possible. He is also banned from entering Chilean territory for three years.
The influencer's lawyer Jaime Barrientos told The Associated Press that Guo landed because he had to divert his aircraft due to poor weather conditions, and that he did receive authorization from Chilean authorities.
""To his surprise, when he was about to take off back to Punta Arenas he was arrested, in a process that from my perspective was a total exaggeration,"" Barrientos said.
Barrientos said he was happy with the agreement struck with authorities.
Guo landed Saturday at Punta Arenas aboard a navy ship wearing a Chilean national soccer team jersey and appeared friendly with the media after disembarking, describing his detention as ""mundane"" experience with ""limited freedoms.""
""The Chilean people have been incredibly hospitable; they've been fantastic people. They've taken care of me. They've taught me Spanish, and they've treated me like family,"" he said.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9rj2145jgo,t3_1na2i6y,Russia targets WhatsApp and pushes new super-app as internet blackouts grow,Plane_Ad1696,2025-09-06 15:32:10,1060,37,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Marina, a 45-year-old freelance copywriter, has relied on WhatsApp for her work and personal life for years.
But one day last month that abruptly changed when a call to a colleague did not go through properly. They tried Telegram - another messaging app popular in Russia - but that did not work either.
She was one of millions of Russians facing new restrictions imposed in mid-August by Russia's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, on calls made through the two platforms - the country's most popular apps.
The timing coincides with the rollout of a new ""national messenger"" app known as Max and created by a Russian firm closely controlled by the Kremlin.
Monthly user numbers of WhatsApp and Telegram are estimated to be 97 and 90 million respectively — in a country of 143 million people.
From parents' chats to tenants' groups, much of daily life runs through them. WhatsApp - whose owner, Meta, is designated an extremist organisation in Russia - is especially popular with older people because of how easy it is to register and use.
In some parts of Russia, particularly in remote and sparsely connected places in the Far East, WhatsApp is much more than chatting with friends and colleagues. Mobile browsing is sometimes painfully slow, so people use the app to coordinate local matters, order taxis, buy alcohol, and share news.
Both apps offer end-to-end encryption which means that no third party, not even those who own them, are able to read messages or listen to calls.
Officials say the apps refused to store Russian users' data in the country, as required by law, and they have claimed scammers exploit messaging apps. Yet Central Bank figures show most scams still happen over regular mobile networks.
Telecom experts and many Russians see the crackdown as the government trying to keep an eye on who people talk to and potentially what they say.
""The authorities don't want us, ordinary people, to maintain any kind of relationships, connections, friendships or mutual support. They want everyone to sit quietly in their own corner,"" says Marina who lives in Tula, a city 180km (110 miles) south of Moscow.
She asked us to change her name, worrying that speaking to foreign media can be dangerous.
The new Max app is being aggressively promoted by pop stars and bloggers, and since 1 September all devices sold in Russia must have Max pre-installed.
It was launched by VK, which owns the country's largest social network of the same name. The Facebook-like platform is controlled by oil-and-gas giant Gazprom and one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidantes, billionaire Yuri Kovalchuk.
Max is set to become a super-app, bringing together multiple functions, including government digital services and banking.
The model mirrors China's WeChat - central to daily life but also a tool of censorship and surveillance.
Max's privacy policy states it can pass information to third parties and government bodies, potentially giving access to the security services or making user data vulnerable to leaks.
In Russia, where people are prosecuted for critical comments or private messages, and a black market of personal data feeds an epidemic of scam calls, this is a real concern.
Although many Russians are worried about the new restrictions on WhatsApp and Telegram, and by the introduction of Max, the state already has vast means to spy on its citizens.
By law, you can only buy a sim card with your national ID, and the security services have access to telecom operators' infrastructure. This means they can find out who you call as well as your whereabouts.
From this month it is now illegal to share your sim card with anyone other than a close relative.
But Max can potentially allow the authorities to read your messages as well - and avoiding the app is getting harder.
Schools are now obliged to move parent chats to the app.
In Rostov region, which borders Ukraine, Max is being adopted as an alert system; in St Petersburg, it is being tied to emergency services.
Despite the push, Max remains far behind its rivals - this week it claimed to have 30 million users.
The Kremlin has long been uneasy of the freedoms offered to people by the internet, which Vladimir Putin once called a CIA project.
The first legislative restrictions came in 2012, soon after mass opposition protests, officially to protect children from suicide-related content.
Ten years later, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the government blocked popular social media sites, such as Facebook, Instagram and X, and most independent media, leaving them accessible only through VPNs.
New restrictions keep coming: as of this month, Russians face fines for ""deliberately searching"" online for extremist materials - more than 5,000 resources from an ever-growing blacklist compiled by the ministry of justice. Examples include a book by opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in prison in 2024, and Ukrainian songs.
Another ban targets adverts on platforms linked to ""extremist"" organisations, in effect ending advertising on Instagram which many small businesses had relied on as a shopfront.
Ads for VPNs are also banned, and while using these apps is not illegal, it may now be treated as an aggravating factor in criminal cases.
Apart from their problems with WhatsApp and Telegram, many Russians are now getting used to life without mobile internet altogether, as entire cities face regular cut-offs.
Since May, every Russian region has seen mobile internet go down.
Blackouts surged through the summer, with up to 77 regions hit by shutdowns simultaneously at the peak, according to theNa Svyazi(In Touch) project.
The authorities justify the measures by the need to protect people and infrastructure from attacks by Ukrainian drones - Kyiv's response to Russia's relentless and deadly bombardments of Ukrainian cities.
But some experts doubt that switching off mobile internet - which many Russians use instead of broadband - is an effective tool against long-distance drone attacks.
Local authorities, who were made responsible for countering drone attacks, have no other means to do it, explains telecom expert Mikhail Klimarev.
""There are no air defence systems, no army - everything's on the frontline,"" he says. ""Their logic goes: we've switched off the internet and there were no drones, hence it works.""
In Vladimir, 200km (125 miles) east of Moscow, two of the city's three districts have been offline for almost a month.
""It's impossible to check bus routes or timetables,"" says Konstantin, a resident who also asked to change his name. ""The information boards at stops also show errors.""
Taxi fares have risen as drivers cannot accept orders online.
State TV in Vladimir spun the shutdown as ""digital detox"", showing residents who said they now enjoyed more walking, reading and spending time with friends.
In Krasnoyarsk, a city of more than a million people in Siberia, mobile internet vanished citywide for three days in July and still works poorly.
Some officials rejected complaints, with one Krasnoyarsk bureaucrat suggesting remote workers who lost income should ""go and work for the special military operation"", as the war in Ukraine is known in Russia. She later apologised.
The government is now working on a scheme that will allow Russians to access only vital online services during shutdowns, such as banking, taxis, deliveries - and the Max messenger.
This is a dangerous step, warns Sarkis Darbinyan, lawyer and co-founder of digital rights group RKS Global.
""There's a possibility the authorities will use this measure for other goals apart from fighting drones,"" he tells the BBC.
He believes the Kremlin's current approach to the internet mirrors Beijing's.
""Unlike the Chinese, Russians have spent decades enjoying cheap, fast internet and foreign platforms,"" he says. ""These services became deeply ingrained not only in people's daily lives but also in business processes.""
For now those who are wary of installing Max on their devices can still find a way around it.
Marina from Tula says her mother, a school teacher, was instructed to download the messenger but claimed to her superiors that she didn't have a smartphone.
People can still call each other using regular mobile networks, although that is more expensive, especially when talking to someone abroad - and not secure.
There are other means available too, like using VPNs or alternative messaging apps, previously reserved for tech nerds and those handling sensitive information.
But as government control over the internet increases, fewer and fewer people will find ways to escape it - and that is assuming the internet is still available for them to try.

reddit,r/news/,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-14/man-running-from-ice-raid-hit-killed-by-car-on-210-freeway,t3_1mqixam,Man fleeing Home Depot immigration raid is hit and killed by a car on the 210 Freeway,thisusernametakentoo,2025-08-15 00:54:24,31941,1183,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Southern California’s immigrant rights community is expressing grief and outrage over the death Thursday of a man hit and killed on the 210 Freeway as he tried to flee Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a raid at a Home Depot in Monrovia.
“It just breaks my heart because it’s just so inhumane,” said Robert Chao Romero, a UCLA professor of Chicano studies and Monrovia resident. “These horrible, unjust ICE policies led to someone dying.”
The man was identified as Carlos Roberto Montoya, a Guatemalan national, per the vice Guatemalan consulate in Los Angeles.
His death at a hospital was confirmed Thursday afternoon by Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik. The circumstances surrounding the fatal accident are under investigation by the California Highway Patrol.
Monrovia police received reports at 9:43 a.m. of immigration agents approaching the Home Depot, according to Feik, who said an officer saw possible Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at the site.
In a emailed statement to The Times, the Department of Homeland Security said that “the individual was not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement” and that the agency was not aware of his death on the freeway until hours after operations in the area had concluded.
Video footage viewed by The Times showed masked men in tactical gear detaining day laborers at the home improvement store parking lot and taking them away in unmarked vehicles. The masked agents did not stay on the scene after the day laborer was struck by the vehicle on the freeway, according to a witness who spoke to The Times anonymously for fear of retaliation from his employer.
A day laborer who asked that his name not be used, citing safety concerns, said he goes to the Monrovia Home Depot every day around 8 a.m. in search of work.
This morning started like any other, he said, until he heard people start to yell, “La migra, corre.” (“Immigration, run!”)
He took out his phone and started to record.
Although he avoided detention, he said, he “felt powerless” that he couldn’t help his friends.
“It feels horrible — I couldn’t do anything for them other than record what was happening,” he said.
As workers scrambled away from the agents, one person jumped a concrete wall and entered the eastbound 210 Freeway. The man ran north across the freeway and was struck by a gray Ford Expedition, traveling about 50 to 60 mph in the fast lane, according to the CHP.
Minutes later, Monrovia Fire & Rescue responded to a call of a vehicle collision with a pedestrian.
A motorist, Vincent Enriquez, said he saw the man still alive soon after he was struck.
“By the time I was passing by ... he must’ve been struck no more than a few minutes prior,” he said. “He was still moving.”
An ambulance took the victim, Montoya, to a hospital. He was a day laborer originally from Guatemala, according to the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, which added that his family is aware of his death.
Monrovia resident Karen Suarez said she rushed to the Home Depot as soon as she heard about the raid and met a woman who identified herself as the daughter of the man who was hit by a car.
“She was visibly very upset, and she was going to go to the hospital and try to find out about her dad,” Suarez said. “I feel so bad for her. I feel so bad for the families. These are people trying to escape whatever horrible atrocities they came from for a better life.”
Consulate officials said they haven’t been able to contact the man’s family.
At 6 p.m., a crowd of about 50 people rallied in front of the Home Depot, waving Mexican flags, carrying signs that read “ICE out of L.A.” and chanting, “When Trump says get back, we say fight back.”
A bouquet of flowers and two prayer candles were placed opposite the 210 Freeway as a memorial for the man who was killed.
CHP officers were asking for surveillance camera video from  businesses as part of their investigation.
Feik said in a statement that the city had not received any communication or information from ICE.
Palmira Figueroa, director of communications for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said 13 people were detained in the raid.
Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the network, said another day laborer was struck by what he believed was an immigration agent in a vehicle.
“His leg is very swollen, and he doesn’t want to go to the doctor because he’s afraid of going to the hospital right now,” he said.
Alvarado said it wasn’t clear whether the immigration agents identified themselves or presented warrants.
“They think that [Home Depot] is a good place where they can come to arrest as many people as they can and comply with their quotas, the quotas that the president, [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller are imposing on them,” he said.
A spokesperson for Home Depot referred all questions about the raid to the federal government and said the hardware store is not notified about immigration raids, nor was the company involved in the operation in Monrovia.
World & Nation
The farmworker who suffered fatal injuries while fleeing an immigration raid in Ventura County was buried in his Mexican hometown.
Romero, the UCLA professor, said the Home Depot operation appeared to be inviolation of the federal court orderbarring the  government from carrying out these types of raids. Last month, a federal judgeissued a temporary restraining orderpreventing federal agents from carrying out indiscriminate immigration arrests based on a person’s race, language, vocation or location.
Immigrant rights advocates voiced their anger after Thursday’s death.
“We hold the Trump administration, the Department of Homeland Security and the Home Depot responsible for his death, and they must be held accountable,” said Ron Gochez, a member of Unión del Barrio, an immigrant rights group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps.
“This is a painful reminder for us that we must continue to boycott the Home Depot due to their complicity to the ICE raids at their stores,” he said. “The Home Depot and the agents that chased the man have blood on their hands.”
In July,Jaime Alanís Garcia,57, was killed during an immigration raid at a farm in Ventura County. The circumstances of his death are still not fully clear, but it sparked concern among immigration advocates.
Alanís’ family said he wasfleeing immigration agents at the Glass House Farms cannabis operationin Camarillo when he climbed atop a greenhouse and accidentally fell 30 feet, suffering catastrophic injury.
But the Department of Homeland Security said that Alanís was not among those being pursued and that federal agents called in a medevac for him.
Home Depots, where immigrant laborers gather in search of work, have been the scene of numerous immigration raids across the region beginning this year.

Police have made clear there is no evidence of foul play in the deaths, but it means that new ballots will have to be printed and some postal voters will have to recast their ballots.
North Rhine-Westphalia has a population of 18 million and a reported 20,000 candidates will run for office in its 14 September local elections.
The number of deaths has nevertheless raised questions on social media. The state's interior ministry has pointed out that candidates from other parties, including the Greens and Social Democrats, have also died.
The AfD became Germany's second biggest party in February's federal elections, spreading from its eastern heartland to areas of the west too.
The domestic spy agency classified it as a right-wing extremist organisation in May, before placing a pause on that description due to an appeal pending in court. In three eastern states, its AfD associations are still listed as extremist.
Initial reports centred on news that four of its candidates had died, and then the deaths of two reserve candidates also emerged, prompting a flurry of conspiracy theories on social media.
AfD co-leader Alice Weidel made no effort to quash the speculation, reposting a claim by retired economist Stefan Homburg that the number of candidates' deaths was ""statistically almost impossible"".
However, asked about the rumours in his party, the AfD's number two figure in North Rhine-Westphalia, Kay Gottschalk, acknowledged on Tuesday that ""what I have in front of me - but that's just partial information - that doesn't back up these suspicions at the moment"".
He told Politico's Berlin Playbook Podcast that his party wanted the cases to be investigated ""without immediately getting into conspiracy-theory territory"". He said they had to tread carefully with the families concerned as they had lost a family member.
Police told Germany's DPA news agency that the four initial deaths were either from natural causes or the cause was not being divulged for reasons of family privacy. The two further deaths have been similarly described.
AfD strategists are hoping for gains in North Rhine-Westphalia's local elections, which are seen as the first test of voters since the new federal government came to power.
In the last state elections in May 2022, the AfD polled just 5.4% in a region that is home to Germany's industrial heartland in the Ruhr valley and has suffered from steep job losses.
The AfD polled 16.8% in the state in federal elections last February and polls suggest the party could almost match those numbers.
The party has found support among several leading US figures on the right who have accused the German government of trying to suppress the AfD through bureaucracy.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who endorsed the far-right party's migration policies earlier this year, has repeated his support for the AfD in recent days.
""Either Germany votes AfD, or it is the end of Germany,"" he claimed.

At least three people have died after an angry mob set fire to a building in Makassar, Indonesia.
Five other people were hospitalised with burns or with broken bones after jumping from the building.
Amnesty International has criticised Indonesia's government saying it is suppressing free speech with crackdowns on public protests.
At least three people have been killed and five have been hospitalised after an angry mob set fire to a local parliament building in an Indonesian provincial capital.
The blaze in Makassar, the capital city of South Sulawesi province, began late on Friday, local time.
Television reports showed the provincial council building ablaze overnight, causing the area to turn an eerie orange colour.
Rescuers had retrieved three bodies by Saturday morning, while five people were hospitalised with burns or with broken bones after jumping from the building, local disaster official Fadli Tahar said.

Protesters in West Java's Bandung city also set a regional parliament ablaze on Friday, but no casualties were reported.
In Surabaya, Indonesia's second-largest city, protesters stormed the regional police headquarters after destroying fences and torching vehicles.
Security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, but demonstrators fought back with fireworks and wooden clubs.
Foreign embassies in Jakarta, including the US, Australia and South-East Asian countries, have advised their citizens in Indonesia to avoid demonstration areas or large public gatherings.
Calm largely returned to Indonesia's capital on Saturday as authorities cleaned up burned-out cars, police offices and bus shelters that were set ablaze by angry protesters.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has cancelled a planned trip to China after the days of protests.
He was heading to China to attend a ""Victory Day"" parade on September 3 to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.
""The president wants to continue monitoring [the situation],"" spokesperson Prasetyo Hadi said.
""The president apologises to the Chinese government that he could not attend.""

Five days of protests began in Jakarta on Monday, sparked by reports that all 580 politicians would receive a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah ($4,650) in addition to their salaries.
The allowance, introduced last year, is almost 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage.
Critics argue the new allowance is not only excessive but also insensitive at a time when most people are grappling with soaring living costs and taxes and rising unemployment.
The protests grew wider and more violent following the death of 21-year-old ride-hailing driver Affan Kurniawan.
People have taken to the streets across the country, with rallies over MP perks growing to include criticism of police after a man died after being hit by a police vehicle.
A video on social media, apparently showing his death during a rally in the capital Jakarta on Thursday, shocked the nation and spurred an outcry against the security forces.
Kurniawan was reportedly completing a food delivery order when he was caught in the clash.
Witnesses told local television that the armoured car from the National Police's Mobile Brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators and hit Kurniawan, causing him to fall.
Instead of stopping, the car ran over him.
On Saturday, hundreds of ride-hailing drivers and students in Bali staged a solidarity demonstration over Kurniawan's death in a rare protest on the tourist island.
They called for police reform and the release of those arrested during the protests.
Protesters marched to Bali's regional police headquarters and riot police fired rounds of tear gas at them to push back those who tried to reach the heavily guarded compound.
The protesters responded by throwing rocks, bottles and flares.
Clashes between riot police and protesters erupted in multiple cities across Indonesia on Friday, including in Medan, Solo, Yogyakarta, Magelang, Malang, Bengkulu, Pekanbaru and Manokwari in the easternmost Papua region.
Some 950 people were arrested in rallies in Jakarta alone by Thursday, according to the National Commission on Human Rights.
Authorities said about 25 officers were hospitalised with serious injuries after being attacked by protesters in Jakarta.

The National Commission on Human Rights believed that the number of injured people on the community side is much bigger.
Amnesty International criticised Indonesia's government on Saturday, saying it suppresses free speech with crackdowns on public protests.
""No one should lose their lives for exercising their right to protest,"" said Usman Hamid, the Executive Director of Amnesty International Indonesia.
""The authorities must immediately and unconditionally release anyone detained solely for exercising their rights,"" he said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Sunday that the Trump administration plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in major cities, including Chicago.
Asked about plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago specifically, Noem told CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” “We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations.”
Asked about what an expansion of ICE operations would look like in Chicago and whether it would involve a mobilization of National Guard troops to assist with immigration raids and arrests, Noem demurred, saying, “That always is a prerogative of President [Donald] Trump and his decision. I won’t speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities.”
Her remarks come one day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnsonsigned an executive orderdirecting his city’s legal department to explore ways to counter a potential surge in federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to Illinois.
During a press conference Saturday, Johnson warned that Chicago officials had “received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our cities see some type of militarized activity by the federal government.”
Earlier this month, the Trump administrationdirected federal law enforcement officers, including those employed by ICE, to assist police in Washington, D.C., with crime-fighting operations. That surge of resources included thousands of National Guard troops who were deployed to the nation’s capital with the stated goal of lowering crime rates.
Following the movement of troops and law enforcement officers to Washington, Trump threatened to send federal officers and troopsto other major American cities, including Baltimore.
Later in the Sunday interview, Noem was asked whether Boston would be one of the cities where the federal government would surge immigration enforcement agents.
“There’s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now, and so we haven’t taken anything off the table,” she said, adding later: “I’d encourage every single big city — San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are — if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom like the people of Washington, D.C., are now ... they should call us.”
Other Democratic officials, including a group of over a dozen governors, have condemned plans to deploy troops to their states.
In a statement last week, they said, “Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow, the President’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members.”
And in an interview that aired Sunday on “Face the Nation,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said, “We don’t want troops on the streets of American cities. That’s un-American. Frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better.”
Pritzker also accused the Trump administration of targeting states run by Democrats rather than those run by Republicans, telling CBS, “Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states. ... Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places, and we’re very proud of the work that we’ve done.”
Asked whether there are plans in place to deploy troops and federal law enforcement officials to states and cities run by Republicans, Noem said, “Absolutely.”
“Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we’ve got operations that, again, I won’t talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we’re doing with a political lens,” she added.

NEW YORK (AP) — A federal judge in New York on Thursday rejected Saudi Arabia’s latest effort to dismiss civil claims that it supported the 9/11 hijackers.
Judge George B. Daniels said in a written opinion that his decision pertained to jurisdiction rather than the merits of the claims against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
However, he found the claims legally sufficient to proceed to trial, noting that an imam and an accountant’s employment by Saudi Arabia likely had some connection with their support of two al-Qaida members who came to the United States in early 2000 to study English and take flight lessons.
Lawyers for Saudi Arabia argued that the nation and the U.S. were partners in the 1990s against terrorism, al-Qaida and its founder, Osama bin Laden.
Lawyers for relatives of 9/11 victims claim that a group of extremist religious leaders in Saudi Arabia aided the 9/11 hijackers who flew planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
In lawsuits, hundreds of victims’ relatives and injured survivors, along with insurance companies and businesses, claim that employees of the Saudi government directly and knowingly assisted the airplane hijackers and plotters and fueled al-Qaida’s development into a terrorist organization by funding charities that supported them.
Some defendants, including Iran, the Taliban and al-Qaida, already have been found in default.

During oral arguments last year, attorney Michael Kellogg noted that Saudi Arabia in the 1990s stripped bin Laden of his citizenship and had taken more actions against him than any other country prior to the Sept. 11 attacks.
A message seeking comment from Kellogg was not immediately returned.
The law firm of Kreinder & Kreindler, which represents plaintiffs, said in a statement that the judge’s decision “ensures that the plaintiffs may continue their long pursuit of truth and justice.”

FormerDepartment of JusticeemployeeSean Charles Dunnis accused of tossing the sandwich at aCustoms and Border Protectionofficer on Aug. 10 in D.C.'s U Street nightlife area.
That officer and other federal authorities had been deployed to Washington by PresidentDonald Trumpto crack down on what the president has claimed is arampant crime problem in the capital.
""F--- you! You f---ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!"" Dunn allegedly shouted at a group of federal officers before slinging the salami sandwich at one of them.
Dunn, 37, wasfired by the DOJ, where he worked in the criminal division's international affairs section, after his arrest at the scene.
""This is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote in a post on X touting Dunn's termination. ""You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.""
But Dunn now faces much less potential time behind bars if convicted of misdemeanor assault than if he were convicted of the felony prosecutors wanted.
Prosecutors lodged a so-called information — a type of charging document — against Dunn in U.S. District Court in D.C. after striking out with the desired grand jury indictment.
CNBC has requested comment from the office of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, which is prosecuting Dunn.
Dunn's defense lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, declined to comment.
Dunn's case is the second one in recent days in which Pirro's office has been unable to convince a grand jury to issue an indictment in a case involving alleged assaults on federal law enforcement officers.
It is extremely rare for DOJ prosecutors to fail to obtain a requested indictment.
On Monday, Pirro's prosecutorstold a judgethat they had been unable in three separate attempts to get grand jurors to indictSydney Reid.
Reid, 44, is accused of forcefully pushing an FBI agent's hand against a cement wall in late July as he was assisting with the transfer of an alleged international gang member at the D.C. jail to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Reid was charged with assault via an information on Monday. She pleaded not guilty on Thursday at her arraignment in D.C. federal court.

The tentative deal, which ended a strike at the airline last month, includes a 12 per cent salary increase this year for most junior flight attendants and an eight per cent bump for more senior members, followed by smaller raises in subsequent years.
The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) said in a statement that 99.1 per cent of members rejected the proposal, arguing flight attendants would still earn less than federal minimum wage.
""The wage issue is now in mediation and, if necessary, will be resolved in arbitration,"" the CUPE statement read.
Air Canada in a statement confirmed that the issue is now in mediation.
Would more airline competition fix flying in Canada?
""We deeply appreciate the patience and the confidence our customers have shown as we worked through this process,"" the airline said.
""The parties also agreed that no labour disruption could be initiated, and therefore there will be no strike or lockout, and flights will continue to operate,"" the airline said.
The three-day flight attendants strike ended Aug. 19 with the help of a federal mediator after it upended thousands of customers' travel plans.
CUPE on Saturday criticized the federal government for what it deemed meddling.
""The federal government's intervention in the negotiations had a corrosive effect that was impossible to ignore,' the union said.
""Rather than remaining neutral, it distorted the balance of the process by offering Air Canada the leverage to limit the wage increases offered to flight attendants.""
A spokesperson for Minister of Jobs and Families Patty Hadju confirmed in a written statement Saturday evening that the ""parties committed, in the event of a failed ratification, to final and binding arbitration to finalize a new collective agreement.""

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A judge ordered a new trial Thursday for three former Memphis police officers who were convicted of federal charges in the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, after defense lawyers argued that another judge who presided over their trial was biased in his belief that at least one of the men was in a gang.
U.S. District Judge Sheryl H. Lipman issued the order for a new trial for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who werefound guilty in October 2024of obstruction of justice through witness tampering.
The ruling marks the latest setback for prosecutors in a case that shocked the country when videos were released showing officers violently kicking and punching Nichols during a traffic stop. The officers who have been granted a new trial in the federal case were acquitted of state murder charges in May. And last year federal prosecutors were unable to secure convictions on the most severe counts against Bean and Smith.
Two other officers charged, Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., pleaded guilty before the federal trial.
Lipman took over the case in June after U.S. District Judge Mark S. Norris, who presided over the case and the trial, recused himself days before the sentencings for the five officers.
In a statement shared by his judicial office Thursday, Norris said, “Because of the code of judicial conduct, I cannot make a statement on this matter.”
In her order, Lipman cited a notice filed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office saying Norris expressed a theory that at least one of the officers was in a gang.
The notice discussed an incident in which Norris’ law clerk was shot during a car theft days after the trial ended. The clerk was staying at the home of another law clerk who had previously worked for Norris on the Nichols case, it said.
The notice also said police investigators believed some juveniles committed the shooting; that Norris wanted those responsible held accountable; and that he “evidenced reasonable frustration with the police investigation.”
Norris met with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and an FBI agent, who explained why no federal charges would be brought in the clerk’s shooting.
Norris indicated that he believed at least one of the former officers was in a gang and that it was responsible for the shooting, the notice said. It also said the U.S. Attorney stated that Norris told those present that the clerk “had been seen by one or more of the Defendants during the trial.”
An assistant U.S. attorney who attended the May 30 meeting also said she remembered that Norris told her he could not meet with police to give a statement because the department was “infiltrated to the top with gang members,” the notice said.
Bean, Haley, and Smith filed motions seeking a new trial, arguing that Norris was biased and violated their rights to due process by presiding over the case.
Smith’s lawyer said there was no “suggestion or one hint in the federal discovery process or the federal trial that any defendant or any member of the Memphis Police Department was in any way affiliated with an illegal street gang either through membership or relationship.”
Haley’s lawyer wrote that “Judge Norris made the gang statements on at least two occasions, demonstrating that it is a firmly held belief, not an off-hand remark.”
Lipman also unsealed several filings made before and after Norris recused himself. In one of them, federal prosecutors argued that there was no evidence that he “harbored any bias before or during trial, let alone the type of extreme bias that would warrant the extraordinary remedy of a new trial.”
Lipman found that while a review showed Norris’ decisions throughout the trial were “sound, fair, and grounded firmly in the law,” a new trial is necessary “because the risk of bias here is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.”
A date for the retrial has not been set. Lipman ordered lawyers to submit positions on what charges they believe need to be tried.
Smith’s attorney, Martin Zummach, said Lipman “did the right thing.” Bean’s lawyer declined to comment, and Haley’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request. Memphis police also declined to comment.
Bean, Haley and Smith were found guilty of trying to cover up the beating byfailing to saythat they or their colleagues punched and kicked Nichols and broke police department rules when they did not include complete and accurate statements about what type of force they used.
Bean and Smith were acquitted of more serious civil rights charges, however.
Haley was found guilty of violating Nichols’ civil rights by causing bodily injury and showing deliberate indifference to medical needs and also conspiracy to tamper with witnesses.
Bean, Haley and Smithwere acquittedin May of all state charges, including second-degree murder. Haley is in federal custody, but Bean and Smith are on limited release.
Martin and Mills pleaded guiltyin federal court last year to violating Nichols’ civil rights by causing death and conspiracy to witness tamper. They did not stand trial in federal court with their former colleagues.
Martin and Mills also avoided a state court trial after reaching agreements to plead guilty.
The officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that was disbanded weeks after Nichols died. The team targeted illegal drugs, guns and violent offenders, and it sometimes used force against unarmed people.
On Jan. 7, 2023, officers yankedNicholsfrom his car and then pepper-sprayed and hit the 29-year-old Black man with a Taser. Nichols fled, and when the five officers, who also are Black, caught up with him, they punched, kicked and hit him with a police baton. Nichols called out for his mother during the beating, which took place steps from his home.
He died three days later.
Video of the beatingcaptured by a police pole cameraalso showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries.
It prompted intense scrutiny of police in Memphis, nationwide protests and renewed calls for police reform.
Norris is a former Republican state senator who was confirmed as a U.S. district judge in West Tennessee in October 2018 after being nominated by President Donald Trump.

Portrait of a Ladyby Giuseppe Ghislandi was featured hanging above a sofa inside a property near Buenos Aires, which was being sold by the daughter of a senior Nazi who fled Germany after World War Two.
A police raid on the house this week however turned up no painting - but two weapons were seized, federal prosecutor Carlos Martínez told local media.
Mr Martínez said they were treating it as an alleged cover-up of smuggling, Argentinian daily Clarin reported.
The newspaper reported that the furnishings had been rearranged and the picture was missing from the wall when they raided the property.
Peter Schouten of the Dutch Algemeen Dagblad newspaper, which first reported the long-lost artwork's reappearance, said there was evidence ""the painting was removed shortly afterwards or after the media reports about it appeared"".
""There's now a large rug with horses and some nature scenes hanging there, which police say looks like something else used to hang there"".
Portrait of a Lady was among the collection of Amsterdam art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, much of which was forcibly sold by the Nazis after his death.
Some of the works were recovered in Germany after the war, and put on display in Amsterdam as part of the Dutch national collection.
For more than 80 years, the location of late-baroque Italian portraitist Giuseppe Ghislandi's painting of the Contessa Colleoni had been unknown until now.
AD's investigation found wartime documents that suggest the painting was in the possession of Friedrich Kadgien, an SS officer and senior financial aide to Hermann Göring, who fled in 1945 before eventually moving to Argentina, where he became a successful businessman.
Kadgien died in 1979, but a US file seen by AD included the line: ""Appears to possess substantial assets, could still be of value to us"".
The paper added that it had made several attempts to speak to his two daughters in Buenos Aires over the years but to no avail.
It was only when one of Kadgien's daughters put the house up for sale that they made any progress in locating the missing works.
Another looted artwork - a floral still-life by the 17th-century Dutch painter Abraham Mignon - was also spotted on one of the sister's social media, AD reported.
Following the photo's appearance, one of the sisters told the Dutch paper she didn't know what they wanted from her, nor what painting they ""are talking about"".
Lawyers for Goudstikker's estate said they would make every effort to reclaim the painting.
His sole-surviving heir, daughter-in-law Marei von Saher, said her family ""aims to bring back every single artwork robbed from Jacques' collection, and to restore his legacy"".
According to AD, she took possession of 202 pieces in 2006.
The display was based at the International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC) in Lincoln.
Abbey Road studios' nominees for its Music Photography Awards had 20,000 submissions from 30 countries.
The painting by the self-taught, Devon-born artist has been in a private collection for 90 years.

A lawsuit newly filed against the Roman Catholic archdiocese ofNew Orleansand its top two officials alleges the city’s archbishop,Gregory Aymond, personally covered up child sexual abuse bypriests and deacons– and asks a judge to reject a guarantee on his future retirement benefits as punishment.
The archdiocese responded by saying the allegations brought by the plaintiff, Argent Institutional Trust Co, are baseless.
“The allegations made by Argent in their lawsuit are based on third hand reports and assumptions with no facts to substantiate them,” a church spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
The lawsuit contains the most direct allegations of wrongdoing leveled against Aymond in a court filing to date, and it comes not from any abuse survivor – but instead from attorneys representing investors who bought $41m in church bond debt back in 2017.
Argent is the bond trustee and filed the lawsuit on Tuesday against the archdiocese, Aymond, vicar general Pat Williams and 104 archdiocesan churches and agencies.
Argent alleges Aymond, Williams and church affiliates they oversee helped “conceal the extent of the abuse” before investors agreed to purchase the church’s bond debt in 2017.
The lawsuit notes that Aymond disclosed a list of 57 credibly accused clergy in 2018 but has since added at least 22 names to the list. In multiple instances, those additions followedreportingfrom WWL Louisiana and a journalist now at the Guardian – the station’s reporting partner – that highlighted certain clergymen who appeared to fit the criteria for inclusion but had been omitted.
Argent cites reporting by the Guardian and WWL in 2023 and 2024 to bolster its claims that Aymond and Williams “knew for years that employees of some or all of the [church affiliates] had sexually abused children and other vulnerable individuals”.
That includes a 2023 story abouta leaked memostating that there were 310 priests, deacons and other church employees named as abusers in claims at the center of the federal chapter 11 bankruptcy protection case filed by the archdiocese three years earlier– but only a quarter of them made it on Aymond’s official list.
It also includesWWLand theGuardian’s coverage of a Louisiana state police search warrant served against the archdiocese, stating there was probable cause to believe the church knew about widespread abuse for decades and it was “covered up and not reported to law enforcement”.
The lawsuit also cites the news outlets’ 2024 report about secret church files exposed in a civil lawsuit against retired priestLawrence Hecker, who shortly before dying pleaded guilty to kidnapping and raping an underage boy. The storyquotedpreviously hidden emails notifying Aymond of Hecker’s long history of abuse in 2011, seven years before the archbishop first notified the public about it.
In July, the archdiocese and a committee of abuse survivors proposed a plan to settle the bankruptcy, and about 660 survivors will have a chance to vote to approve or reject the plan by 29 October.
The plan offers survivors between $180m and $235m, estimated to be about a sixth of the midpoint estimate of what the claims are worth. Under the settlement, the church has stopped paying interest to bondholders, which Argent alleges would also significantly reduce payments to the church’s investors by about $9.3m. That led Argent to accuse the archdiocese of “the definition of securities fraud” in open court. Attorneys for the church called that an “extreme stretch”.
While the proposed bankruptcy settlement would allegedly shortchange some church creditors, the plan would guarantee full retirement pension benefits to all priests who have not been identified by the church or the court as abusers, including Aymond and Williams. Church financial records estimate total priest pension obligations at $55m.
The proposed settlement also sets aside investment accounts held by the church’s affiliates worth at least $149m, making sure they essentially “pass through” the bankruptcy as if it never happened.
Argent’s lawsuit asks bankruptcy judge Meredith Grabill to order the church and its affiliates to pay the bondholders in full – before any priests can collect retirement benefits and before the parishes and other church affiliates can cash in their investments.
Argent alleges Aymond and Williams, who serve as officers of every church affiliate, failed to report all known cases of abuse to law enforcement or child protective services as required by a 1993 church policy. Therefore, Argent alleges, the pair should forfeit their rights to collect benefits before the bondholders.
In November, Aymond turned 75 and, as with all Catholic bishops, was required by church law to submit his retirement letter to the Vatican. Neither then pope Francis nor the late pontiff’s successor, Pope Leo XIV, has accepted Aymond’s retirement.
Aymond is expected to stay in his post until the bankruptcy case is fully settled."

Their legal complaint filed in a Washington DC Federal Court seeks a legal ban on the UK communications regulator enforcing or attempting to enforce the Online Safety Act against them in the US.
""American citizens do not surrender our constitutional rights just because Ofcom sends us an e-mail,"" Preston Byrne of law firm Byrne & Storm said.
Ofcom told the BBC: ""We are aware of this lawsuit. Under the Online Safety Act, any service that has links with the UK now has duties to protect UK users, no matter where in the world it is based.""
A service doesn't have to be based in the UK to be subject to the act, and therefore face action from Ofcom.
It could be enough for it to have a significant number of UK users, or to have the UK as a target market.
But 4chan's lawyers want the US court to rule that US business with no presence in the UK are not subject to British legislation.
The also want it to declare that the Online Safety Act is at odds with the US constitution's free speech protections.
Lawyers for online message board 4chanrecently told the BBCthat Ofcom had provisionally decided to impose a £20,000 fine ""with daily penalties thereafter"" for failing to comply with two requests for information.
Ofcom alleges 4chan has not complied with the act with respect to the requests for information, but has not confirmed the provisional fine.
It has alsostated that it continues to investigate4chan over whether it is complying with Online Safety Act duties to protect its users from illegal content.
The US legal case is being brought on behalf of 4Chan Community Support LLC, and Lolcow LLC, the corporate entities behind 4chan and online forum, Kiwi Farms.
4chan has often been at the heart of online controversies in its 22 years, including misogynistic campaigns and conspiracy theories.
Users of Kiwi Farms have previously been linked to a number of serious incidents of harassment and trolling.
Both sites operate ""fully in compliance"" with US laws, the legal complaint says.
According to the filing, Ofcom has written twice to Kiwi Farms, beginning with a March letter telling it to comply with Online Safety Act duties requiring it to ""carry out an illegal content risk assessment"" and submit the record of that assessment to Ofcom by 17 April 2025.
The legal complaint alleges that Ofcom uses its powers under the Online Safety Act to threaten to impose ""ruinous civil penalties and referrals to law enforcement for criminal penalties, including arrest and imprisonment"" to American citizens and businesses if its orders are not obeyed.
It seeks to ""restrain Ofcom's conduct and its continuing egregious violations of Americans' civil rights, including, without limitation, to the right of freedom of speech"".
Ronald Coleman of the Coleman Law Firm, which is also acting for the plaintiffs 4chan and Kiwi Farms, said his clients were defending ""the free speech rights of every American.""
""We have asked the Court to confirm that Ofcom has no authority to impose or enforce unconstitutional UK laws on American soil.""
Among the actions the legal case seeks the court to take are:
A declaration that Ofcom's orders and demands are unenforceable in the US as they are inconsistent with the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments to the US Constitution, relevant US legislation and public policy.
A permanent injunction prohibiting Ofcom from enforcing or attempting to enforce the Online Safety Act against the plaintiffs in the US.

A Cabazon husband and wife were each charged with murder on Tuesday, Aug. 26, accused of killing their 7-month-old son Emmanuel, whose body has not been found during an ongoing search that has made headlines nationwide for almost two weeks.
Jake Haro, 32, and Rebecca Haro, 41, were also each charged with filing a false police report, a misdemeanor.
Hours later, the Haros made their first court appearance in the case at the Riverside County Hall of Justice. They were placed almost as far apart as possible — Rebecca Haro sitting in the jury box in a blue jail jumpsuit, and Jake Haro sitting in a red jail jumpsuit, indicating he’s in a protected population, near the incarcerated defendants’ entrance.
They did not enter a plea, with their next court appearance scheduled for Sept. 4.

It is unclear what evidence investigators have. District Attorney Mike Hestrin scheduled a news conference for Wednesday, Aug. 27, to discuss the case.
Last year, Hestrin personally prosecuted a body-less case when Owen Skyler Shover was convicted of murderingMoreno Valley teenager Aranda Briones. Hestrin hung the largely circumstantial prosecution on incriminating text messages and surveillance images.

The media, at least three dozen strong, and Haro friends and family members filled the sixth-floor courtroom for the three-minute hearing. Outside, more media, including those solely with social-media platforms with thousands of followers, gathered.
Haro friends and family members declined to comment to reporters.
Rebecca Haro told San Bernardino County sheriff’s investigatorsthat she was changing the baby’s diaper by her vehicle on Aug. 14 outside a Big 5 store in Yucaipa when she was assaulted and knocked unconscious by an unknown man. When she awoke, the child was gone, she said.
Investigators interviewed multiple people, including the Haros, but when confronted with inconsistencies in her initial account, the mother declined to continue with interviews, sheriff’s officials said. Sheriff’s investigators later said her account was a lie —and the Haros were arrested on Aug. 22.
During a Sunday, Aug. 24, jailhouse interviewwith a Southern California News Group reporter, Rebecca Haro stood by her assertion that Emmanuel was kidnapped.
Later that day, Jake Haro, wearing a red jail jumpsuit,accompanied investigators as they looked for Emmanuel’s bodyin a brushy area off of the 60 Freeway near Gilman Springs Road in the Riverside County Badlands. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department has not said whether Haro led investigators to that location or whether the investigators targeted that spot on their own.
The search for Emmanuel comes almost four years after Jake Haro and a different spouse, Vanessa Haro, were charged with willful child cruelty in Riverside County after an infant was found to have fresh and healing injuries that left the baby in critical condition.
According to an affidavit written by a Hemet police officer to obtain an arrest warrant, officers investigated a report that a 10-week-old girl had been admitted to Hemet Valley Hospital on Oct. 13, 2018, for treatment of broken bones.
Vanessa Haro, also known as Vanessa Avina, according to the document, told officers that she had left home for an hour before the baby was injured. During that time, Jake Haro told investigators, he bathed the baby and accidentally dropped it chest-first on the divider of the twin-basin sink.
That night, Vanessa woke up Jake because she was concerned about the baby. He felt something “crackle,” the affidavit says. Jake told the investigator that he did not feel a crackle after bathing the infant. He blamed his wife for the injuries.
Both pleaded guilty in 2023. Jake Haro’s plea was to the judge and not done in consultation with the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office. He received 180 days in the sheriff’s work-release program and was handed a suspended, four-year prison sentence and ordered to attend a child-abuser treatment program.
Under Vanessa Haro’s plea deal, also made directly with the judge, she got 120 days in the work-release program and was also told to attend the treatment program.
In a totally separate case, Jake Haro is due in court on Sept. 2 to answer to a charge of being a felon or addict in possession of a firearm.
In the case concerning their son, the Haros are each being held in lieu of $1 million bail.

Addressing the country’s parliament, Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said there were 19 intrusions of its airspace, and that a “large proportion” of the drones entered it from Belarus.
He announced that Poland has invoked Article 4 of NATO, meaning the alliance’s main political decision-making body will meet to discuss the situation and its next steps.
Tusk called the incident an “unprecedented violation of (its) airspace” and said it lasted all night – from just before midnight local time on Tuesday until 6:30 a.m. on Wednesday.
Polish media reported that debris from one of the drones hit a residential building in the village of Wyryki in eastern Poland, near the border with both Ukraine and Belarus. Photographs from the scene geolocated by CNN show extensive damage to a family house there.
No injuries were reported, according to Polish media.
Another piece of a drone was discovered near a cemetery in Cześniki in Zamość County, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Wyryki, according to a statement from the local prosecutor’s office.
Tusk said it was the first time Russian drones had been shot down over the territory of a NATO member state and the incursion involved a “huge number” of them.
“We are most likely dealing with a large-scale provocation,” Tusk said on Polish television, following an emergency meeting of the country’s National Security Bureau.
He said the “situation is serious” and that Poland was “ready to repel” this type of attack.
“The security of our homeland is our highest priority,” Polish President Karol Nawrocki said.
Poland is a member of NATO, the transatlantic defense pact involving the United States that employs the principle that an attack on one is an attack on all.
Europeanfaith in the reliability of that alliance has been shakenunder US President Donald Trump who, alongside key cabinet members, have called on Europe to lead in its own defense.
NATO spokesperson Allison Hart said its chief Mark Rutte was in touch with the Polish leadership and that NATO itself was “closely consulting” with Poland.
The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called the incident “the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began.” Kallas said that the “indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,” adding that: “Russia’s war is escalating, not ending.”
The Polish military thanked NATO member the Netherlands for contributing F-35 fighter jets to defensive operations overnight, which have now concluded.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said at least eight “Shahed” drones had been aimed toward Poland, in what he called “an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.” His own country endured a Russian attack involving 415 drones and 40 missiles overnight.
The leader of the newest NATO member, Sweden, called the presence of Russian drones over Poland “unacceptable.”
“The Russian war of aggression against Ukraine poses a threat to the security of all of Europe,” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a post on X.
“Russia is deliberately expanding its aggression, posing an ever-growing threat to Europe,” said GitanasNauseda, the president of Lithuania, also a NATO member.
The incursion comes as Trump’s attempts to strike a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine have ground to a halt, with Moscow only scaling up its aerial assaults.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Russian President Vladimir Putin is “testing the West.”
“Russian drones flying into Poland during the massive attack on Ukraine show that Putin’s sense of impunity keeps growing,” Sybiha said in a post on X.
Ned Price, a US State Department spokesperson during the Biden administration, also thought Russia may have sent drones over Poland to test NATO resolve and defenses.
While cautioning it could be the case that the drones flew over Poland by mistake or because of Ukrainian countermeasures, Price told CNN’s Laura Coates their presence, if deliberate, could expose what Russia might see as “weakness.”
US Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, was more direct.
“Repeated violations of NATO airspace by Russian drones are fair warning that… Putin is testing our resolve to protect Poland and the Baltic nations,” Durbin said in a post on X.
Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Territorial Defense forces had been activated to search for downed drones.
He urged people to “remain calm” and said anyone who found fragments of military equipment should report it to authorities.
Earlier, authorities closed airspace over Warsaw International Airport and other smaller airports “due to unplanned military activity related to ensuring state security,” according to a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) posted on the US Federal Aviation Administration’s website.
The Warsaw airport reopened Wednesday morning, Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said in a post on X.
The military activity over Poland comes less than a week after Putin was in China, where hemet with leader Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Unin show of unity between the authoritarian allies.
Since then, Russia has staged its largest aerial assaults on Ukraine since it fully invaded its neighbor more than three years ago.
The recent attacks have largely targeted residential areas around the country and in the capital of Kyiv. On Tuesday,24 civilians were killedin a Russian strike on the village of Yarova in the easternDonetsk region, Ukrainian officials said.
Last weekend, Russia deployed more than 800 drones inits largest attack to date, striking a government building in Kyiv for the first time.
The attack hit the Cabinet of Ministers building, which houses the prime minister’s office, as well as some government ministries.
All these attacks have come less than a month after Putin’s summit with Trump in Alaska that ended without a deal to end the war. Any progress made has long since evaporated with Russia’s expanded aerial attacks.
Poland earlier announced it was closing its eastern border with Russian ally Belarus, due to joint Russian-Belarusian military exercises beginning Friday, Reuters reported.
The Zapad 25 large-scale exercises, which will take place in western Russia and Belarus, have raised security concerns not only in Poland but also in the neighboring NATO countries on Lithuania and Latvia, according to Reuters.
“On Friday, Russian-Belarusian maneuvers, very aggressive from a military doctrine perspective, begin in Belarus, very close to the Polish border,” Prime Minister Tusk told a government meeting, Reuters reported.
“Therefore, for national security reasons, we will close the border with Belarus, including railway crossings, in connection with the Zapad maneuvers on Thursday at midnight,” Tusk said.
CNN’s Chris Lau, Gianluca Mezzofiore and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.

The proposal, first reported by theFinancial Times, was confirmed to CNBC'sMegan Cassellaby two sources familiar with the matter.
Trump made the request when he was called into a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials in Washington, the Financial Times reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the discussion. Washington was also prepared to ""mirror"" any tariffs imposed by Europe on the two countries, the report said.
The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.
The U.S. has imposed a punitive 25% tariff on imports from India over New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil, taking the total duties to as high as 50%. India has said the tariffs are ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,"" while calling out the U.S. and the EU's trade with Russia.
The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according toEuropean Commission data.
Data from the Indian embassy in Moscowshowed bilateral trade between New India and Russia reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion.
China,the biggest purchaser of Russian oil, has so far been spared from the ""secondary"" tariffs, after securing a truce with Washington to reduce the new levies on its products to 30%.
Trump's proposal comes as his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska last month has yielded little progress toward securing a ceasefire in Ukraine. After the meeting, Putin told reporters in a joint press conference with Trump that the ""root causes"" of the conflict needed to be addressed for a sustainable peace.
""There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway,""Trump said after Putin's remarkslast month, without elaborating.
While Washington's quest to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine has come to naught, Putin appears to have cemented his ties with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Beijing last week.
In a post on X Tuesday night stateside, Trump said the U.S. and India have resumed trade negotiations to address trade barriers. Calling Modi a ""very good friend,"" the president said he was ""certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion.""
Washington's negotiations with China appear to be struggling to reach a breakthrough, with a late-August visit to Washington by top Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang yielding little progress.

BBC News has confirmed the identities of 10 members of the Infidels Motorcycle Club working in Gaza for UG Solutions - a private contractor providing security at Gaza Humanitarian Foundation sites, where hundreds of civilians seeking food have been killed in scenes of chaos and gunfire.
We can reveal that seven members of the gang are in senior positions overseeing sites at the controversial aid operation backed by Israel and US President Donald Trump.
UG Solutions (UGS) defended its employees' qualifications for the job, saying it does not screen people out for ""personal hobbies or affiliations unrelated to job performance"".
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it has ""a zero-tolerance policy for any hateful, discriminatory biases or conduct"".
Infidels MC was set up by US military veterans of the Iraq war in 2006 and members see themselves as modern Crusaders, using the Crusader cross as their symbol - a reference to the medieval Christians who fought Muslims for control of Jerusalem.
The gang is currently hosting anti-Muslim hate speech on its Facebook page and has previously held a pig roast ""in defiance of"" the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
""Putting the Infidels biker club in charge of delivering humanitarian aid in Gaza is like putting the KKK in charge of delivering humanitarian aid in Sudan. It makes no sense whatsoever,"" said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), a leading Muslim civil rights organisation in the US.
""It's bound to lead to violence, and that's exactly what we've seen happen in Gaza.""
The gang's leader, Johnny ""Taz"" Mulford, is a former sergeant in the US Army who was punished for conspiracy to commit bribery, theft and making false statements to military authorities. He is now the ""country team leader"" running UG Solutions' contract in Gaza.
We emailed Infidels MC for comment. In response, Mr Mulford instructed fellow leaders of the biker gang not to reply but included the BBC when he clicked ""reply all"" - inadvertently disclosing email addresses and names of fellow Infidels MC members, some of whom were working in Gaza.
By matching up names with public information about Infidels MC's leadership, and evidence from UG Solutions insiders who worked with them, we have identified 10 members of Infidels MC who Mr Mulford recruited to work with him in Gaza.
In addition to Mr Mulford, we have identified three leading members of Infidels MC who also have senior roles at UGS's Gaza operation:
Confidential documents, open-source information and former UGS contractors have enabled us to confirm the identities of a further six Infidels bikers hired to work in Gaza. Three of them are leaders or deputy leaders of the firm's armed security teams.
Mr Jarrett, Mr Siebe and Mr Lofton did not respond to requests for comment.
UGS told the BBC it conducts comprehensive background checks and only deploys vetted individuals. However, news reports indicate Mr Jarrett was arrested two years ago in the US for drunk driving and has a previous charge of driving under the influence from about a decade earlier. It is not known whether either case resulted in a conviction.
The founder and chief executive of UG Solutions, Jameson Govoni, was arrested earlier this year in North Carolina for his alleged involvement in a hit-and-run incident and for fleeing from police to evade arrest, according to court documents. Mr Govoni, who is based in the US and is not a member of Infidels MC, declined to comment.
Until now Mr Mulford was the only UG Solutions contractor to have been identified as a member of the Infidels. The BBC's investigation reveals how widespread his hiring of members of the biker gang has been, notably to better-paid jobs leading the UGS armed security teams.
Social media posts show that in May, just two weeks before travelling to Gaza, Mr Mulford sought to recruit US military veterans who follow him on Facebook, inviting anyone who ""can still shoot, move and communicate"" to apply.
In total, at least 40 of about 320 people hired to work for UG Solutions in Gaza were recruited from Infidels MC, according to an estimate by a former contractor.
UG Solutions is paying each contractor $980 (£720) per day including expenses, rising to $1,580 (£1,160) per day for team leaders at GHF's ""safe distribution sites"", documents seen by the BBC show.
One leader of a team in Gaza overseeing site security, Josh Miller, posted a photo of a group of contractors in Gaza with a banner reading ""Make Gaza Great Again"".
The banner advertises the logo of a company he owns which sells T-shirts and other clothing, including one which has the slogan ""embrace violence"" and another which says: ""Surf all day, rockets all night. Gaza summer 25.""
His company also posted a video online showing scenes of gun violence and advocating the shooting of criminals, with the caption: ""Remember, always shoot until they're no longer a threat!""
Mr Miller has the word ""Crusader"" tattooed across his fingers and ""1095"" on his thumbs. This is the year when the leader of the Catholic church, Pope Urban II, launched the first crusade, attacking Muslims as a ""vile race"". Mr Miller did not respond to requests for comment.
A post on the Infidels MC Facebook page selling ""1095"" hats says it signifies the start of the Crusades, ""a military campaign by western European forces to recapture Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Muslim control"". The ""Holy Land"" refers to the area mostly covered by modern-day Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Johnny Mulford, who in addition to leading the gang is listed as theregistered agent of a Florida company called Infidels MC, has the date 1095 tattooed across his chest. He has a Crusader cross tattooed on his right forearm and another on his left upper arm along with the word ""Infidels"".
""When you see anti-Muslim bigots today celebrating 1095, celebrating the Crusades, they are celebrating the wholesale massacre of Muslims - the erasure of Muslims and Jews from the holy city of Jerusalem,"" said Mr Mitchell from the US Muslim civil rights organisation CAIR.
He said the gang had the hallmarks of anti-Muslim hate groups which for decades have used the name ""Infidels"".
Anti-Islamic views expressed by the gang include a flyer for the pig roast during Ramadan, which the BBC found on an archived web page. It says: ""In defiance of the Islamic holiday of Ramadan… we invite you to attend the Infidels MC Colorado Springs Chapter open bike party & pig roast.""
The flyer also shows a woman wearing a burka that has been torn off from the neck down, exposing her chest.
The Infidels MC Facebook page has hosted clearly Islamophobic discussions. In 2020 the club shared a link to a false, satirical article claiming four US Democratic politicians, two of them Muslim, wanted the Bible to be deemed hate speech.
Comments from members of the Facebook group included: ""Filling my magazine to the max. Would not be the first time we were at odds with muslims""; ""Deport these pathetic skanks to a pathetic third world crap hole where they won't be offended by the Holy Bible""; and a comment dismissing ""them and their Mohammad"" with an expletive.
As of Wednesday, the comments remain on the Infidels MC Facebook page.
The Infidels MC website also used to show the skull logo of the violent Marvel comic book character Punisher, a symbol appropriated by white supremacist groups, inscribed with ""kafir"" in Arabic script - which translates as ""unbeliever"" (or ""infidel"").
Scenes of chaos and danger have been common at the aid distribution sites in Gaza since they opened at the end of May. Up to 2 September, 1,135 children, women and men were killed near GHF sites while seeking food,according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
The UN has said most of the killings appear to have been carried out by Israeli security forces. Incidents where civilians were harmed while seeking aid are ""under review by the competent authorities in the IDF"", the Israeli military said.
UGS has deniedallegations that its security contractorsalso fired on civiliansand that it put people seeking food in danger due to incompetent leadership. However, the company has admitted that warning shots have been used to disperse crowds.
In a statement, UG Solutions, based in North Carolina, said Johnny Mulford is a ""trusted and respected figure"" with more than 30 years' experience supporting the US and its allies globally. ""We stand by his reputation, record, and his contributions to the success of complex missions,"" the company said.
""We do not screen for personal hobbies or affiliations unrelated to job performance or security standards. Every team member undergoes comprehensive background checks, and only qualified, vetted individuals are deployed on UG Solutions operations,"" UGS said.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said it relies on ""people from all backgrounds"" to provide aid in Gaza and to build trust with Gazans.
""The team providing aid at the Foundation's sites is diverse - and it is successful for that reason,"" the GHF said.
Organisers said two boats were hit in separate incidents; Tunisian authorities disputed the first and have not commented yet on the second.
Meanwhile, the White House says the Israeli strike ""does not advance Israel or America's goals"".
The US president says he feels ""very badly"" about the location of the attack and calls Qatar a ""close ally"".
Israel carried out a strike on senior Hamas leaders in Qatar's capital Doha on Tuesday.
The PM will stress the ""the action Israel must take to end the horrific suffering"" in Gaza, No 10 said.

reddit,r/worldnews/,https://bbc.com/news/articles/c5yvjnp295xo,t3_1na5j14,Seoul holds emergency meeting after citizens detained in US Hyundai raid,kim_putin_donald,2025-09-06 17:33:12,14097,643,N/A,N/A,N/A,"South Korea's government has held an emergency meeting and vowed to swiftly respond to the arrests of hundreds of its citizens in a massive immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in the US.
Seoul has dispatched diplomats to the site in Georgia, while LG Energy Solution, which operates the plant with Hyundai, said it was suspending most business trips to the US.
US officials detained 475 people - mostly South Korean nationals - who they said were found to be illegally working at the battery facility, one of the largest foreign investment projects in the state.
The White House defended the operation, dismissing concerns that the raid could deter foreign investment.
""They were illegal aliens and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] was just doing its job,"" President Donald Trump said following the raids on Friday.
Video released by ICE officials showed Asian workers shackled in front of a building, with some wearing yellow vests with names such as ""Hyundai"" and ""LG CNS"".
""People on short-term or recreational visas are not authorized to work in the US,"" ICE said, adding that the raid was necessary to protect American jobs.
""This operation sends a clear message that those who exploit the system and undermine our workforce will be held accountable,"" Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agent Steven Schrank said in a statement on Saturday.
South Korea, a close US ally, has pledged tens of billions of dollars in American manufacturing investment, partly to offset tariffs.
The timing of the raid, as the two governments engage in sensitive trade talks, has raised concern in Seoul.
Trump has actively encouraged major investments from other countries while also tightening visa allocations for foreign companies.
Many of the LG employees arrested were on business trips with various visas or under a visa waiver programme, officials say.
South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Hyun said he felt a ""great sense of responsibility for the arrest of our citizens"" as he presided over an emergency meeting about the issue on Saturday.
He said the government had set up an Overseas Korean Protection Task Force to respond to the arrests and that he may travel to Washington if needed.
""Immediately after this incident became known, the President stressed that U.S. law enforcement actions must not unjustly infringe upon the rights of our nationals or the economic activities of our Korean-invested companies,"" he said.
On Saturday, LG Energy Solution announced it was sending its Chief Human Resources Officer Kim Ki-soo to the Georgia site on Sunday.
""We are making all-out efforts to secure the swift release of detained individuals from our company and partner firms,"" it said in a statement.
""We are confirming regular medications for families through an emergency contact network for detainees and plan to request that necessary medications be delivered to those detained.""
The company said it was suspending most business trips to the US and directing employees on assignment in the US to return home immediately.
South Korean media widely described the raid as a ""shock,"" with the Dong-A Ilbo newspaper warning it could have ""a chilling effect on the activities of our businesses in the United States"".
The factory, which makes new electric vehicles, had been touted by Georgia's Republican governor as the biggest economic development project in the state's history, employing 1,200 people.
The arrested workers were being held at an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, until the agency decides where to move them next.
LG Energy Solution said 47 of its employees and about 250 workers for contractors at the joint venture factory were detained.
In June, member states agreed to boost defence spending and reconfirmed Nato's mutual security guarantee.
The judge's ruling is a win for the US Federal Reserve following criticism by the president.
They were originally expected to leave the US at about 14:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Wednesday.
The US President wants to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine.
The talks between India and EU come as Trump urges EU to impose 100% tariffs on India and China for buying Russian oil.

A senior Israeli official told CNN that among those targeted was Hamas’ chief negotiatorKhalil Al-Hayya. “We are awaiting the results of the strike,” the official said.
Hamas said later Tuesday that the strike killed five members but failed to assassinate the negotiating delegation. Al-Hayya was not listed among the dead, but his son and the director of his office were killed in the strike, Hamas said.
Qatar and Hamas both said that a Qatari security official died in the strike, as well.
Qatar’s prime minister was visibly angry as he described the attack as “state terrorism” at a press conference. “This is a message to the entire region: that there is rogue player in the region,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani said.
The Qatari foreign ministry’s spokesperson, Majed Al Ansari, said “the cowardly Israeli attack” targeted residential buildings housing several members of the Hamas political bureau in Doha.
“While strongly condemning this attack, the State of Qatar emphasizes that it will not tolerate this reckless and irresponsible Israeli behavior,” Al Ansari said on X.
Hours after the strike, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel accepted a new US ceasefire proposal and that the attack could bring the end of the war closer.
“The days when the heads of terror enjoyed immunity anywhere are over,” Netanyahu said in Hebrew at a US embassy event in Jerusalem. “I will not allow such immunity for the murderers of our people.” An Israeli security official said the operation “could potentially generate a shift” that could bring an end to the war in Gaza, though it’s unclear how targeting the chief Hamas negotiator would lead to such a change.
Qatar has beena key mediator in Gaza ceasefire talks, maintaining direct channels with the US, Israel and Hamas. It has also hosted multiple rounds of negotiations, and senior Israeli officials – including the head of the Mossad spy agency and top Israeli negotiators – have visited Doha. Whether such visits will continue remains uncertain.
Einav Zangauker, the mother of an Israeli hostage held in Gaza, said Tuesday’s strike could serve as a death sentence for her son.
“I am trembling with fear. It could be that at this very moment, the prime minister has essentially executed my Matan, sentenced him to death,” Zangauker wrote on X. “Why is he insisting on blowing up every chance for a deal?”
Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, condemned the attack, saying “Qatar has been playing a very positive role to achieve a ceasefire and release of all hostages,” according to a UN spokesperson.
The Israeli strike involved more than 10 fighter jets which fired more than 10 munitions, according to an Israeli official, and they all struck a single target in the Qatari capital.
An Israeli source who spoke to CNN said the United States was informed ahead of the strike. Two US officials confirmed to CNN that the Trump administration had been notified.
In a statement, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said, “Today’s action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation. Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it, and Israel takes full responsibility.”
The short missive appeared designed to distance the US from the Israeli attack on a critical American ally in the Middle East.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the strike “unfortunate” and said it ran counter to US President Donald Trump’s goals in the region. “Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a sovereign nation and close ally of the United States that is working very hard in bravely taking risks with us to broker peace, does not advance Israel or America’s goals,” she said.
Still, Leavitt’s carefully worded statement made clear that “eliminating Hamas” was a “worthy goal,” and stopped short of condemning Israel’s actions.
Later on Tuesday, Trump sought to further distance himself from the attack, posting an addendum to an earlier statement from the White House that specified the decision was made by Israel’s leader and that the US learned of it too late to intervene.
“This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, inserting the line into a statement read earlier from the White House briefing room by Leavitt.
Trump added that by the time his administration learned of the attack and told the Qataris, there was little he could do to stop it. Qatar’s prime minister said earlier that the US contacted Qatar 10 minutes after the attack occurred, and that Israel used weapons that went undetected by radar.
Qatar’s Amiri Diwan said in a statement that Trump expressed his solidarity with Qatar following the attack, in a phone call with Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.
Trump “stressed that the State of Qatar is a trusted strategic ally of the United States of America, calling on His Highness the Amir to continue Qatar’s mediation efforts to end the war in the Gaza Strip,” the statement said.
Two Israeli sources said the attack, which the IDF called “Summit of Fire,” had been planned about two or three months ago but was accelerated in recent weeks.
Qatar has denied receiving prior notification of the strike, calling reports that suggested otherwise “baseless.”
Qatar is one of the US’ closest allies in the Middle East and home to theAl Udeid Air Base, the biggest American military facility in the region. A key security partner of Washington, it was designated a Major Non-NATO Ally in 2022.
Al Udeid came under Iranian attack this year after the US struck nuclear facilities in Iran during Israel’s June campaign.
Following Tuesday’s strike, the US embassy in Qatar instituted ashelter-in-place orderfor its facilities in the country, it said in a post on X.
“We have seen reports of missile strikes occurring in Doha. The US Embassy has instituted a shelter-in-place order for their facilities. US citizens are advised to shelter-in-place,” it said. The order was later lifted but the embassy said it will continue to monitor the situation.
Shortly after the explosion in Qatar, the IDF issued a statement saying it had targeted “senior leadership” of Hamas with “a precise strike” in a joint operation with the Shin Bet security agency.
“For years, these members of the Hamas leadership have led the terrorist organization’s operations, are directly responsible for the brutal October 7th massacre, and have been orchestrating and managing the war against the State of Israel,” the IDF said.
Qatar presses Hamas to ‘respond positively’ to US ceasefire proposal, official says
On Monday, Khalil Al-Hayya met with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani in Doha.
During the discussion,Al-Thani pressured Hamasto “respond positively” to aUS ceasefire proposalfor Gaza, according to an official familiar with the meeting. The proposal, which was put forward this week, called on Hamas to release all Israeli hostages in exchange for negotiations to end the war in the enclave.
It’s not the first time Israel has carried out an attack that undermines US diplomatic efforts. In June,Israel opened a military campaignagainst Iran while Washington was in talks with Tehran over its nuclear program. Although both the US and Iran had already voiced doubts about making progress, the Israeli strikes effectively ended any chance of an agreement.

Buildings belonging to the European Union and the British Council were damaged in the strikes into Thursday, causing both the EU and the United Kingdom to summon the top Russian diplomats in their capitals.
Among those killed were children aged 2, 17 and 14, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Military Administration. The vast majority of those killed – 22 – died in a strike on a five-storey building in the Darnytskyi district, according to emergency services.
Ukraine’s air force said that the Kremlin unleashed 629 air attack weapons on the country overnight, comprising 598 drones and 31 missiles.
Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for the air force, told CNN that the strikes comprised “one of the largest combined attacks” on the country.
Russia’s defense ministry said it struck “military-industrial complex enterprises and military air bases in Ukraine” using “high-precision weapons.”
How Russia’s drone attacks have reshaped the war in Ukraine: An illustrated guide
Ukrainian authorities said hundreds of responders were sent to incidents in multiple locations, including a building used by the EU mission to Ukraine and the British Council.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha accused Moscow of targeting diplomats “in direct breach of the Vienna convention” and called for “worldwide condemnation” in a statement on X.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that she was “outraged” by the incident, calling it “another grim reminder of what is at stake.”
“These Russian missiles and attack drones today are a clear response to everyone in the world who, for weeks and months, has been calling for a ceasefire and for real diplomacy,” he said in an earlier post.
The EU chief spoke to both Zelensky and US President Donald Trump following the strikes, von der Leyen added in apost on X, also stating that Russian President Vladimir Putin “must come to the negotiating table.”
The EU mission, which has been based in Kyiv since 1993, works to “promote the political and economic relations” between Ukraine and the EU, among other mandates, according to its website.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, said Putin was “killing children and civilians, and sabotaging hopes of peace.”
Ukrainian President VolodymyrZelenskycalled the assault a “horrific and deliberate killing of civilians” in aposton X. “It shows that the Kremlin will stop at nothing to terrorize Ukraine, blindly killing civilians, men, women and children, and even targeting the European Union,” she said.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow was still interested in peace talks, but emphasized that the “special military operation,” Russia’s way of describing the war, “continues.”
Trump was “not happy” but “not surprised” by the strikes, the White House said Thursday, adding that he was watching the developments “intently.”  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump wants the war to end, but both Putin and Zelensky “must want it to end as well.”
The White House’s special envoy for Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, also condemned the overnight strikes,writing on Xthat “these egregious attacks threaten the peace that (Trump) is pursuing.”
Vitaliy Protsiuk, a resident of Kyiv, told CNN that his wife has been missing since the attack.
The couple were getting ready to go to their building’s bomb shelter when there was an “explosion,” Protsiuk said.
“I was buried,” he continued. “When I came out, everything was covered in dust and smoke. I looked up – the roof was gone, and the floors from the fourth to the first were completely destroyed.
“As of now, my wife hasn’t been found. Her phone doesn’t respond. She’s not listed anywhere. I don’t know… we’re still searching,” Protsiuk added.
Residents endured an air raid alert lasting more than nine hours overnight, according to interior minister Ihor Klymenko.
Agency pictures showed locals flocking once more to subway stations where many spent the night. Residents were advised to “stay in shelters” during the strikes and the all-clear was announced shortly before 7am local time.
The major attack on Ukraine’s capital comes just over two weeks after Trump heldface to face talkswith Putin, seeking to secure and end the war.
But momentum around the discussions has stalled, with no sign that a bilateral meeting the White House has pushed between Zelensky and Putin will take place.
On Wednesday, Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky’s office, and Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, met with Saudi Arabia’s defense minister to discuss an end to the conflict.
A delegation from Ukraine is also set to meet US officials in New York on Friday, according to Zelensky.
Meanwhile, Putin is set to travel to China next week to attend a massive military parade. Other guests will include North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as well as Russia-friendly European leaders such as Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Slovakia’s Robert Fico.
The attack on Kyiv is the latest in a series of Russian assaults across Ukraine this week.
Ukrainian open-source researchers confirmed on Tuesday that Russian troops hadcaptured two villagesin Ukraine’s southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region.
Russian forces now occupy the villages of Zaporizke and Novoheorhiivka, according to DeepState, a group tracking battlefield developments.
Ukraine’s outmanned and outgunned military has struggled to fend off grinding Russian advances in much of the east as Moscow increases pressure on Kyiv to give up territory in any peace negotiations.
“Russia chooses ballistics instead of the negotiating table,” Zelensky wrote in his message on X after the latest overnight attacks. “It chooses to continue killing instead of ending the war. And this means that Russia still does not fear the consequences.”
In his analysis of Russia’s latest strikes on Kyiv, Tkachenko said the Kremlin has a typical “signature” which involves “combined attacks from different directions” and targeting “ordinary residential buildings.”
Decoy missiles were used as false targets to confuse Ukrainian defense systems, the military chief added.
Several high-rise residential buildings were damaged, as well as a kindergarten, private housing, non-residential blocks, offices, transport infrastructure and dozens of cars, officials said.
Friday has been declared a day of mourning in Kyiv, according to city authorities. Flags will be flown at half-mast, with entertainment events canceled, it said.

As the world’s attention was focused on Israel’s attack on Hamas leaders in Doha, Israeli forces continued their unrelenting bombardment of Gaza, killing more than 50 people on Tuesday.
Among the dead are nine Palestinians, who had gathered in the enclave’s south seeking aid. Israel pressed on with its offensive in Gaza City after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened Palestinians to flee to the south for their lives.
The Wafa news agency reported that a drone strike on a makeshift tent sheltering displaced families at Gaza’s port killed two civilians and injured others. Warplanes also hit several residential buildings, including four homes in the al-Mukhabarat area and the Zidan building northwest of Gaza City, it reported.
Another house was reportedly bombed in the Talbani neighbourhood of Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, while two young men were killed in an attack on civilians in the az-Zarqa area of Tuffah, northeast of Gaza City.
Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency confirmed footage showing an Israeli strike on the Ibn Taymiyyah mosque in Deir el-Balah. The video captured a flash of light before the mosque’s minaret was enveloped in smoke. Despite the blast, the minaret appeared to remain standing.
Israel issued new evacuation threats on Monday, releasing maps warning Palestinians to leave a highlighted building and nearby tents on Jamal Abdel Nasser Street in Gaza City or face death. It told residents to move to the so-called “humanitarian area” in al-Mawasi, a barren stretch of coast in southern Gaza.
But al-Mawasi itself has been repeatedly bombed, despite Israel insisting it is a safe zone. At the start of the year, about 115,000 people lived there. Today, aid agencies estimate that more than 800,000 people – nearly a third of Gaza’s population – are crammed into overcrowded makeshift camps.
Philippe Lazzarini, the chief of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, described al-Mawasi as a vast camp “concentrating hungry Palestinians in despair”.
“There is no safe place in Gaza, let alone a humanitarian zone. Warnings of famine have fallen on deaf ears,” he said.
The Palestinian Civil Defence warned that “Gaza City is burning, and humanity is being annihilated”.
The rescue agency said that in just 72 hours, five high-rise towers containing more than 200 apartments were destroyed, leaving thousands of people homeless.
More than 350 tents sheltering displaced families were also flattened, it added, forcing nearly 7,600 people to sleep in the open, “struggling against death, hunger, and unbearable heat”.
More than 64,000 Palestinians have been killed, some 20,000 of them children, in the Israeli offensive, which has been dubbed a genocide by numerous scholars and activists. The International Criminal Court has also issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu for alleged war crimes.
The Government Media Office in Gaza said that more than 1.3 million people remain in Gaza City and surrounding areas, despite Israeli attempts to push them south. It described the evacuation orders as an effort to carry out “the crime of forced displacement in violation of all international laws”.
More than 90 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced multiple times in 23 months of genocidal war, and an Israeli curb on aid entry, including food items, has led to starvation deaths. Last month, a UN agency declared famine in Gaza, affecting half a million people.
On Tuesday morning, Palestinians in central Gaza staged a protest against the latest evacuation orders.
Reporting from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said that demonstrators carried banners reading, “We will not leave”, and “Not going out”.
“The primary goal of the [Israeli] occupation is displacement,” said Bajees al-Khalidi, a displaced Palestinian at the protest. “But there’s no place left, not in the south, nor the north. We’ve become completely trapped.”
Violence also flared in the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces killed two teenagers in the Jenin refugee camp, according to the Wafa news agency.
Mourners on Tuesday buried 14-year-old Islam Noah, who was shot while attempting to enter the besieged refugee camp. A funeral was also held for another 14-year-old, Muhammad Alawneh. Two others were wounded in the same incident.
Israel sent missiles at Doha as Hamas leaders were meeting in the Qatari capital for talks on the latest ceasefire proposal from the United States to end the war in Gaza. Hamas said five people were killed, while Qatar said a security official was also among the dead. Hamas said its leadership survived the assassination attempt.
Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al ThanicondemnedIsrael’s “reckless criminal attack” in a phone call with US President Donald Trump. Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani called the attack “state terrorism”.
The Qatari prime minister said Doha would continue to work to end Israel’s war on Gaza, but raised doubts about the viability of the most recent talks. “When it comes to the current talks, I don’t think there is something valid right now after we’ve seen such an attack,” he said.
Qatar has sent a letter to the UN Security Council, condemning what it calls a cowardly Israeli assault on residential buildings in Doha.
The Doha attack has drawn global condemnation, with the UN chief calling it a “flagrant violation” of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar.
The White House claimed that the US had warned Qatar of the impending strike, but Doha rejected that account, insisting the warning came only after the bombing had begun.
Trump later said he felt “very badly about the location of the attack” and that he had assured Qatar that it would not happen again.
“This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America’s goals.”

The Czech agency, also known as BIS, said in a statement that a team of European agents discovered spies in several European countries from Belarus’ KGB security agency. BIS said that a former deputy head of Moldovan intelligence service SIS who handed over classified information to the KGB was among them.
The Czechs also expelled a Belarusian agent who was operating under the cover of a diplomat. That person was given 72 hours to leave the Czech Republic, the Czech Foreign Ministry said Monday.
The Czech agency said that Belarus managed to create the network because its diplomats are able to freely travel across European countries.
“To successfully counter these hostile activities in Europe, we need to restrict the movement of accredited diplomats from Russia and Belarus within the Schengen (borderless) area,” BIS head Michal Koudelka said in a statement.
The agency didn’t immediately offer more details.
Russia strikes Ukrainian government building, in largest air attack of war
Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, said on Monday that it implemented an arrest warrant for a 47-year-old suspect on treason charges. The suspect had previously held management positions within Moldova’s SIS. The suspect allegedly disclosed state secrets to Belarusian intelligence officers that would likely “endanger national security,” DIICOT stated.
The Romanian agency added that, between 2024 and 2025, the Moldovan suspect – who wasn’t named – met twice with Belarusian spies in Budapest, Hungary, and that there is “reasonable suspicion” that the meetings involved “transmitting instructions” and exchanging payments for services provided.
The ongoing international investigation has been supervised by the European Union’s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust.
Belarus is led by authoritarian PresidentAlexander Lukashenko, who is a closeallyof Russian President Vladimir Putin. Lukashenko let Russia use Belarusian territory as a staging ground for Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and later allowed the deployment of Russian tactical nuclear missiles.

As global shipping is set to get more expensive, most industries, including thetoy industry, are already feeling the financial impact.
Unfortunately for the toy consumer, particularly theLego fanatic, things are about to get more complicated. According to404 Media,Legowill now stop shipping individual pieces. What used to be an easy way to replace random lost or missing bricks is now going to be a worse headache, as its Pick a Brick program will make “more than 2,500 pieces” unavailable for shipment to the United States and Canada.
The change took effect on August 25, four days before the August 29 elimination of the de minimis trade exemption, which removed fees on goods valued less than $800. The tariffs in effect would make the Pick a Brick program unfeasible for the Danish collectible toy company. Many pieces go for less than a dollar within the “standard” collection, which is shipped from Denmark. Pieces in the bestseller collections are still available, but it makes it trickier for those seeking specific pieces for more complex builds that aren’t in the bestseller catalog.
It’s a really unfortunate result of the new shipping laws that makes a vast selection of the service inaccessible to shoppers in the United States and Canada.Lego’s Pick a Brick pagenoted the change as a pause. “In the US & Canada, standard pieces are temporarily unavailable. You can still shop our Bestseller range, which includes thousands of the most popular bricks and pieces ready to order,” it reads on the page when you go to see what’s available and what’s not.

The Mainz-based newspaper of record suggests this to be the result of the ""depth of his [Modi's] anger, but also his caution"".
The attempts by President Trump to talk to PM Modi came even as his administration hit India with 50% tariffs, the highest for any country other than Brazil.
The Indo-US ties, cultivated over 25 years, hit a rough patch with Trump targeting India for being trade surplus. DC also imposed penalties on New Delhi for India buying crude oil from Russia.
""FAZ claims that Trump tried to call Modi four times in recent weeks but that Modi refused the calls,"" posted Thorsten Benner, Co-Founder and Director of the Berlin-based Global Public Policy Institute, on X, sharing a copy of the newspaper report.
FAZ stands for Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Zeitung means newspaper in German.
""I don't care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together,"" Trump remarked July 31.
Modi on August 10 took a veiled dig Trump's ""dead economy"" remark, asserting that India was progressing towards becoming one of the world's top three economies.
FAZ noted the signs that ""Modi was offended"".
It also noted that Trump's approach typically allowed him to capitalise on other countries' dependence on the US market. But Modi ""resisted this"" in Trump's first term, maintaining a cooperative relationship with Trump without compromising India’s economic interests.
But FAZ noted that the surprising element of this situation was Trump's repeated attempts to persuade Modi to yield.
""The fact that the Indian still refuses to talk demonstrates the depth of his anger, but also his caution"", the report by the German newspaper stated.
FAZ then went on to explain the reason behind the caution.
Trump had previously renegotiated a trade pact between the US and Vietnam, which had been painstakingly arranged by delegations, during a single phone call with General Secretary To Lam.
Without reaching an agreement, Trump announced on social media that a trade deal had been struck. ""Modi doesn’t want to fall into the same trap,"" FAZ said.
""America's strategy isn't working,"" says Mark Frazier. ""The American concept of an 'Indo-Pacific' alignment, in which India would play a central role in the US's containment of China, is collapsing."" According to Frazier, co-director of the India-China Institute at the New School in New York, India never intended to commit to siding with the US against China.
FAZ also noted that Trump’s construction projects in India have also stirred controversy. Near Delhi, the Trump family company built luxury towers under his name. The 300 apartments, priced up to twelve million euros, sold out in a single day in mid-May, FAZ reported.
But after Trump claimed that he alone had secured a ceasefire in the recent India-Pakistan military conflict, there was anger on the Indian side.
""The fact that Trump announced he would develop oil reserves with Pakistan, which India would then purchase from its arch-enemy, didn't make matters any better"", the report stated.
""Even the fact that Trump hosted Pakistan's army chief, Asim Munir, for a working dinner in the Oval Office was perceived in India as a provocation,"" it added.
FAZ noted that old tensions in New Delhi are easing. Since meeting Xi last year, Modi said he has felt above all ""respect.""
Later this week, he will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, raising questions about whether Trump is pushing India toward China.
""India needs China more than China needs India,"" says Frazier. ""India’s shift is strategic, not just a response to US tariffs. With the US retreating, India and China share interests in global influence and industrial growth. For China, India is key to boosting its global economic and geopolitical position"".
According to India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), Modi spoke to Trump at the President's request on June 17. The two were to meet on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Canada, but Trump returned to the US earlier than scheduled.
""After this, at the request of President Trump, both leaders spoke over a phone call today (July 17). The conversation lasted approximately 35 minutes,"" the MEA said in the statement released on June 18.
The MEA said Trump expressed his condolences on the call on the April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, and also expressed his support against terrorism.
""This was the first conversation between the two leaders since [the attack and Operation Sindoor],"" the MEA said, adding ""Hence, Prime Minister Modi spoke in detail about Operation Sindoor with President Trump.""
Trump had claimed that it was his mediation and trade offers that made India and Pakistan agree to a ceasefire in May after four days of war. New Delhi rejected the claim on multiple occasions.
""Prime Minister Modi clearly conveyed to President Trump that at no point during this entire sequence of events was there any discussion, at any level, on an India-US Trade Deal, or any proposal for a mediation by the US between India and Pakistan,"" the MEA said of the June 17 call between the two leaders.
""The discussion to cease military action took place directly between India and Pakistan... and it was initiated at Pakistan's request. Prime Minister Modi firmly stated that India does not and will never accept mediation. There is complete political consensus in India on this matter,"" it stated.

EN
Around 10 countries, led by Britain and France, may send troops to Ukraine under a new peace framework, with US backing but no American boots on the ground.
European leaders are moving to translate US PresidentDonald Trump’s support into a concretesecurity planfor Ukraine, with about 10 countries prepared to send troops as part of a future peace deal.
According to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, officials discussed the deployment of British and French soldiers, including the size and positioning of forces, at a meeting on Tuesday.
Follow our coverage of the war on the@Kyivpost_official.
“About 10 countries would be ready to send forces to the war-battered nation,” the report reads.
“When it comes to security, they’re willing to put people on the ground,” Trump told Fox News. “We’re willing to help them with things, especially – probably you could talk about by air, because there’s nobody that has the kind of stuff we have, really they don’t have. But I don’t think it’s going to be a problem.”
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later told reporters that Trump understood the guarantees were “critically important to ensure a lasting peace.”
“He has directed his national security team to coordinate with our friends in Europe and also to continue to cooperate and discuss these matters with Ukraine and Russia as well,” she said.
Leavitt added that whileTrump had ruled out US boots on the ground, Washington could “certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees.”
Europeanmilitary officials are set to meet US counterparts in the coming days to work out “robust security guarantees and prepare for the deployment of a reassurance force if the hostilities ended,” the British government said.
The talks will also involve NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the military leaders of member states, people familiar with the matter said.
Antonio Costa, president of the European Council, said the terms of the guarantees should be arranged “in the coming days, preferably this week.”
According to Bloomberg, as outlined in the proposal, the first stage would bolster Ukraine’s military with training and reinforcements. This would be followed by a multinational presence – with Britain and France ready to send hundreds of soldiers – stationed away from the front line.
A US role is expected to include intelligence sharing, border surveillance, weaponry and possibly air defense, officials said. At a minimum, European officials expect Washington to continue supplying intelligence and hardware through its partners.
While many EU leaders welcomed Trump’s stance as a breakthrough, officials remain skeptical that the guarantees alone will deter Moscow. The Kremlin, which insists Ukraine cede control of occupied territories, has rejected the idea of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil.
According to a recent Kyiv Post article, as Trump tries to cast himself as the ultimate dealmaker in Ukraine,policy experts warn he is being outmaneuvered by Russian leaderVladimir Putin.
While Trump hosted President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders at the White House on Monday, Russia launched one of its largest assaults in weeks – over 270 drones and 10 missiles – a clear signal from the Kremlin that it feels no pressure to slow its war.
Matt Duss, executive vice president at the Center for International Policy, told Kyiv Post: “Trump is very good when he can bully people… but Putin is someone who knows how to handle Donald Trump.”
He pointed to the recent Alaska summit, where Trump dropped his demand for an immediate ceasefire and instead accepted Putin’s push for long-term talks on Russian terms.
“Donald Trump has shown him that he’ll go along with it,” Duss said.
Retired US Army Colonel Richard Williams was even more blunt, suggesting that a “hot mic” moment revealed Trump discussing a personal “quid pro quo” with Putin.
Both experts agree that by ceding ground on key issues – including Crimea and Donbas – Trump risks handing Putin a diplomatic victory while leaving Ukraine with “toothless and ineffective” security guarantees.

Al Jazeera, citing the director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza City, said correspondents Anas Al-Sharif and Mohammed Qraiqea were killed on when their tent near the hospital complex was struck on Sunday night, local time.
In a later update, Al Jazeera reported that the death toll had risen to five, including photographers and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, and Moamen Aliwa.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed they intentionally targeted Al-Sharif in the strike, alleging he was “a terrorist, who posed as a journalist for the Al Jazeera network.” The IDF claimed he was involved in militant activity and using his role as a journalist as cover.
Just minutes before the strike, Al-Sharif had posted on social media about heavy Israeli bombardment in parts of Gaza City. “Relentless bombardment… For two hours, the Israeli aggression has intensified on Gaza City,” his final post read.
In an earlier post, Al-Sharif wrote: “If this madness does not end, Gaza will be reduced to ruins, its people’s voices silenced, their faces erased — and history will remember you as silent witnesses to a genocide you chose not to stop.”
Al-Sharif had reported extensively on the war in Gaza for Al Jazeera, frequently broadcasting live from the field and sharing updates on social media about ongoing military operations. He was known for his on-the-ground coverage from some of the most heavily affected areas.
Qraiqea contributed to Al Jazeera’s coverage of the conflict, producing video reports and interviews from across the territory. He had been reporting from Al-Shifa Hospital in recent days.
The Committee to Protect Journalists reports at least 186 journalists and media workers killed during the Israel-Hamas war, describing it as the deadliest period for the profession since tracking began in 1992. The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate and the International Federation of Journalists have reported higher figures.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave Donald Trump a golf club during his visit to Washington this week that had belonged to a serviceman fighting Russia’s invasion, Kyiv said on Tuesday.
Trump, an avid golfer who owns several courses, accepted the gift and presented Zelenskyy with symbolic keys to the White House in return, the Ukrainian leader’s office said.
The warm exchange marks a stark turnaround from February, when Zelenskyy left the White House early after a televised shouting match with Trump and the US vice-president, JD Vance.
Since that tense encounter, Zelenskyy has sought to repair ties, flattering Trump in public appearances and praising his efforts to secure peace.
“The president ofUkrainepresented the president of the United States with a golf club,” Zelenskyy’s office said.
The club previously belonged to Kostiantyn Kartavtsev, a Ukrainian soldier who “had lost a leg in the first months of Russia’s full-scale invasion while saving his brothers-in-arms”, the office said.
Zelenskyy showed Trump a video of Kartavtsev, it said.
Later on Tuesday, the Ukrainian veteran organisation United byGolfpublished a video of Trump holding the golf club and thanking Kartavtsev.

“I just watched your swing. I know a lot about golf and your swing is great,” Trump said in the video. “You’re an amazing person, and you just keep playing golf and doing all of the other things. Your country is a great country. We’re trying to bring it back to health.”
Zelenskyy also brought a letter for Melania Trump from his wife, Olena Zelenska, thanking the US first lady forwriting to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, urging him to save children’s lives.
Foreign leaders visiting the White House have been trying to woo Trump with various gifts. In late February, the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, brought him an invite for an official visit with a letter signed by King Charles III."

The president of Argentina,Javier Milei, has been pelted with stones while campaigning near the capital Buenos Aires by demonstrators protesting about allegations of corruption involving his influential sister.
The far-right leader, who was whisked from the scene by his security detail, sustained no injuries after his motorcade was attacked, presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni wrote on X.
As Argentina prepares for legislative elections in October, Milei’s campaigning has been overshadowed byhis administration’s worst alleged corruption scandal.
For more than a week, the country’s news agenda has been dominated by the repercussions of leaked audio recordings in which a former government official can be heard discussing the alleged payment of bribes linked to the purchase of medicines for people with disabilities.
In the recordings, Diego Spagnuolo, head of the National Disability Agency and a former Milei lawyer, claimed thatMilei’s powerful sister, Karina Milei, pocketed 3% from each contract.
On Wednesday, Milei and his sister were riding in the back of a pickup truck and greeting supporters in Lomas de Zamora, 20km (12 miles) south of Buenos Aires, when protesters began throwing plants, rocks and bottles at their vehicle.
The vehicle quickly left the scene. Afterwards, scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the libertarian leader.
Shortly afterwards, Mileiposted on his social mediaa photo showing a stone flying just above his head, accompanied by the words: “CIVILISATION OR BARBARISM. KIRCHNERISMO NEVER AGAIN,” a reference to the opposition led by former presidentCristina Fernández de Kirchner.
The justice minister, Patricia Bullrich,wrote on her social mediathat the attack had been organised by Fernández’s supporters.
But others suggested that the stone-throwing was a reaction to the alleged corruption scandal.
Minutes after the incident, the Buenos Aires governor, Axel Kicillof, a former economy minister under Kirchner,said at another campaign event: “Milei, the people have already seen through you: fraudster, liar” – though he did not mention the stone-throwing.
Shortly before the attack, Milei broke his silence on the corruption allegations, telling reporters: “Everything [Spagnuolo] says is a lie … We are going to bring him to justice and prove he lied,” referring to the man who, according to Argentine media, was once close to Milei and a frequent visitor to the Casa Rosada.
Karina Milei has not addressed the allegations. The president’s sister assumed the post of secretary general of the presidency after Milei scrapped a decree barring relatives from public office, and she is widely seen as the “chief architect” behind her brother’s rise to power.
Known as El Jefe (the male boss) by insiders including the president himself, Karina Milei is said to decide his agenda, political alliances and which journalists he will or will not speak to.
The scandal allegations, which public prosecutors are investigating, represent what could be a major threat for Milei in the run-up to the provincial legislative elections in Buenos Aires – which account for almost 40% of the electorate – on 7 September, and the national elections on 26 October.
The vote will be the first big test of his support since the libertarian economist took office in December 2023 on a promise to revive Argentina’s ailing economy.
Lara Goyburu, a political scientist and executive director at the consulting firm Management & Fit, said the scandal could affect voter turnout because it appears closer to the “old-fashioned corruption” Milei had promised to fight."
reddit,r/worldnews/,https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/police-arrest-900-london-protest-supporting-banned-group-125336887,t3_1nb7otl,Hundreds arrested at London protest supporting banned group Palestine Action,wizardofthefuture,2025-09-07 23:04:55,328,40,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Almost 1,600 people have been detained since it was outlawed two months ago.
LONDON --British police said Sunday that they arrested almost 900 people demonstrating in London againsta ban on the group Palestine Action, which has been deemed a terrorist organization by the government.
Almost 1,600 people have now been detained, many for silently holding signs supporting the group, since it was outlawed two months ago. Protesters say the ban on Palestine Action is an unwarranted curb on free speech and the right to protest.
The Metropolitan Police force said 890 people were arrested at Saturday's demonstration, the vast majority, 857, under the Terrorism Act for supporting a proscribed organization. Some 33 were detained for other offenses, including 17 for assaulting police officers.
Defend Our Juries, the campaign group organizing the protest, said 1,500 people took part in the demonstration outside Parliament, sitting down and holding signs reading “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action.”
Within minutes, police began arresting the demonstrators, as bystanders chanted “Shame on you,” and “Met Police, pick a side, justice or genocide.” There were some scuffles and angry exchanges as officers dragged away demonstrators who went limp as they were removed from the crowd.
“In carrying out their duties today, our officers have been punched, kicked, spat on and had objects thrown at them by protesters,” said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Claire Smart, who called the abuse directed at police “intolerable.”
Defend Our Juries said aggression had come from police officers and dismissed claims that protesters had been violent as “frankly laughable.”
More than 700 people werearrested at earlier protests, and 138 have been charged under the Terrorism Act.
Mike Higgins, 62, who is blind and uses a wheelchair, was arrested last month but returned to demonstrate on Saturday.
“And I’m a terrorist? That’s the joke of it,” he said. “I’ve already been arrested under the Terrorism Act and I suspect I will be today.
“Of course I’ll keep coming back. What choice do I have?”
The government proscribed Palestine Action in July, after activistsbroke into a Royal Air Force baseand vandalized planes to protest against what they called Britain’s support forIsrael’s offensive against Hamasin Gaza. The activists sprayed red paint into the engines of two tanker planes and caused further damage with crowbars.
Proscription made it a crime to publicly support the organization. Membership of, or support for, the group is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.
Palestine Action has carried out direct action protests in the U.K. since it formed in 2020, including breaking into facilities owned by Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems UK, and has targeted other sites in Britain that participants believe have links with the Israeli military.
The group has targeted defense companies and national infrastructure, and officials say their actions have caused millions of pounds in damage that affect national security.
Banning the group, then-Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said, “The assessments are very clear, this is not a nonviolent organization.”
Palestine Action has won approval from the High Court to challenge the ban, a ruling the government is seeking to overturn. The case is ongoing, with a hearing scheduled for Sept. 25.
The U.N. human rights chief has criticized the British government’s stance, saying the new law “misuses the gravity and impact of terrorism.”
The decision to designate Palestine Action as a terrorist group “raises serious concerns that counterterrorism laws are being applied to conduct that is not terrorist in nature, and risks hindering the legitimate exercise of fundamental freedoms across the UK,” Volker Türk warned.
He added that according to international standards, terrorist acts should be confined to crimes such as those intended to cause death or serious injury or the taking of hostages.
Huda Ammori, Palestine Action’s co-founder, has condemned the government’s decision to ban it as “catastrophic” for civil liberties, leading to a “much wider chilling effect on freedom of speech.”
The group has been supported by prominent cultural figures including bestselling Irish author Sally Rooney, who said she planned to use the proceeds of her work “to keep backing Palestine Action and direct action against genocide.”
Israel — founded in part as a refuge in the wake of the Holocaust, when some 6 million European Jews were murdered — vehemently denies it is committing genocide.
Britain’s government stressed that proscribing Palestine Action as a terrorist group does not affect other lawful groups — including pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel voices — campaigning or peacefully protesting.
About 20,000 people, by a police estimate, attended a separate pro-Palestinian march in London on Saturday.

ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — A 16-year-old high-school student attacked a police station in westernTurkeyon Monday with a shotgun, killing two police officers, officials said.
Two other police officers and a civilian were wounded in the attack in the Balcova district of Izmir, Turkey’s third largest city, Izmir province Gov. Suleyman Elban said.
The assailant was arrested and the motive was under investigation, Elban said at the scene.
The teenager, who hasn’t been identified, was subdued by police after being shot in the leg, according to Turkish news reports.
Police in Istanbul later detained a 32-year-old Iranian national who was allegedly in contact with the assailant, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. The suspect was identified only by his initials K.N.
Earlier, the assailant’s parents and two of his friends were also detained for questioning as part of the investigation.
“The perpetrator of the incident, a 16-year-old man, has been apprehended. His connections are being investigated,”President Recep Tayyip Erdogansaid. “I offer my condolences to our entire police force.”
Elban said the assailant had no previous criminal record. He lived on the same street as the police station and used a pump-action shotgun belonging to his father during the assault, Elban said.
A video of the assault posted on Cumhuriyet newspaper’s website showed the wounded teenager shouting “God is great” while lying on the pavement as police tried to subdue him.
Bystanders can be heard yelling “Take his weapon!” and “Call an ambulance!” Moments later, the suspect reached into a backpack and threw an object, prompting panicked shouts of “Bomb!” and “Shoot him, brother, shoot him!” from the crowd.
The assailant first shot and killed a police officer who was standing guard in front of the station. The second victim was a police chief inspector who was killed in an ensuing clash, Elban said.
