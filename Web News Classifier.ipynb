      "A fugitive father who had been hiding in New Zealand’s rugged wilderness with his three children for nearly four years has been shot dead by police investigating an armed burglary, police said on Monday.\n",
      "The whereabouts of Tom Phillips has attracted headlines around the world since just before Christmas 2021, when he fled into the Waikato wilderness with his children Ember, now 9, Maverick, 10, and Jayda, 12, following a custody dispute with their mother.\n",
      "Police, alerted to a burglary early on Monday, pursued two suspects on a quad bike before coming under fire from one of them from a high-powered rifle, authorities said. Police returned fire, killing the shooter, who they believe to be Phillips, pending formal identification.\n",
      "Hours later, authorities located Phillips’s children, two of whom were believed to be in the wilderness, amid concerns they would be alone in temperatures that were forecast to reach freezing overnight.\n",
      "Police deputy commissioner Jill Rogers said they were found at a local campsite, adding: “I can confirm that the children are well and uninjured, and they will be taken to a location this evening for medical checks.”\n",
      "Earlier, Rogers said: “This has been a deeply traumatic incident this morning for those involved. It has been confronting and challenging in a small, rural, isolated location.”\n",
      "Prime minister Christopher Luxon said the morning’s events were “sad and absolutely tragic”.\n",
      "“This is not what anybody wanted to happen today and I think that is … a consistent feeling from everybody across New Zealand,” he told media on Monday afternoon.\n",
      "In a statement to broadcaster RNZ, the mother of the three children, known as Cat, said she was relieved the ordeal had come to an end but was “saddened by how events had unfolded”.\n",
      "“Our hope has always been that the children could be returned in a peaceful and safe way for everyone involved,” she said.\n",
      "Rogers said police were called to a commercial property at 2.30am after reports of a burglary at a rural farm supply store in Piopio. “Information came to police that described two people on a quad bike, dressed in farm clothing and wearing headlamps,” Rogers said.\n",
      "The quad bike was spotted travelling along a rural road, with items from the store attached. Police officers laid spikes at an intersection, which the quad bike ran over, she said. The quad bike came to a halt, which is when police came under fire, with one officer sustaining critical but survivable injuries.\n",
      "“Our officer has been struck in the head … soon after a second patrol unit arrived and engaged the offender,” she said, adding the offender was given immediate first aid but died at the scene. “The formal identification of this male is yet to take place, but we believe him to be Tom Phillips.”\n",
      "Rogers said one of his children was located at the scene, as well as multiple firearms. “The child located at the scene is being provided wrap around support, and we will not be providing any other comment at this time on their location.”\n",
      "Specialist teams, including about 50 staff and the armed offenders squad, were out in force to locate the other two children, Rogers said on Monday afternoon, noting there were about three hours of daylight left.\n",
      "“It will be down to freezing point, I would imagine, this evening,” the acting deputy commissioner said. “Hence we want this incident resolved as soon as possible.”\n",
      "The police constable who suffered critical injuries is undergoing the first of many surgeries at hospital.\n",
      "Cat expressed her concern for the police officer who was injured in the incident and to the community that had been affected. “Your compassion has sustained us,” she said.\n",
      "The family would be working with government agencies to support the safe return and reconnection of the children, she said. “They have endured a long and difficult journey, and we ask for privacy as we help them adjust and reintegrate into a stable and loving environment.”\n",
      "The mayor of Waitomo, John Robertson, told the Guardian it was the worst possible outcome for the community.\n",
      "“I’m shattered, to be honest and there will be many in the community that are devastated that this was the outcome after three and a half, four years,” he said.\n",
      "Robertson said the community was deeply concerned for the welfare of the children and he had hoped that the situation would have been resolved through negotiations with Phillips.\n",
      "Phillips’ family and the family of the policeman would be deeply affected, he said.\n",
      "“It’s just devastating news. Really the worst outcome we could have expected.”\n",
      "The vast Waikato region, where Phillips was presumed hiding, is made up of long sweeping coastline to the west, forested terrain and farmland in the centre, limestone cave networks to the north and a smattering of small rural towns and settlements throughout.\n",
      "Phillips came from a farming family in Marokopa – a tiny coastal settlement of less than 100 people that became inextricably linked with Phillips’s story.\n",
      "The remoteness of the landscape frustrated police attempts to locate Phillips.\n",
      "The case has fascinated New Zealanders, who have struggled to understand how, in a country of close-knit communities, Phillips could have evaded detection. While there was no suggestion his family helped Phillips, the question of how he managed to conceal himself and his three children – and survive – in the harsh terrain puzzled the nation, leading to speculation others in the community may have aided him.\n"

      "The first signs of a takeoff of Africa’s green economy are raising hopes that a transformation of the continent’s fortunes may be under way, driven by solar power and an increase in low-carbon investment.\n",
      "African leaders are meeting this week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Africa Climate Summit, a precursor to the global UN Cop30 in November. They will call for an increase in support from rich countries for Africa’s green resurgence, without which they will warn it could be fragile and spread unevenly.\n",
      "Richard Muyungi, the climate envoy and adviser to the president of Tanzania, said: “Africa is ready to be part of [the global fight to stave off climate breakdown] provided we are supported with finance, technology and capacity-building.\n",
      "“There has been an increase of investments in some areas but Africa still needs a lot of financing to be able to be part of the global solution, and to address the challenges we are facing.”\n",
      "Green energy is booming in Africa, with 20 countries breaking records for imports of solar panels in the 12 months to June. According to the thinktank Ember, imports of photovoltaic equipment from China rose by 60% over the past year, from 9MW in 2024 to 15MW of capacity, with a tripling of imports to countries outside South Africa.\n",
      "Though the increase is impressive, it is from a low base. Africa, which boasts the greatest potential for solar power, has lagged far behind other countries in installations. Only 4% of global solar generation last year was in Africa, and in 2023, the International Energy Agency reported that Belgium had as many solar panels as the entire continent.\n",
      "“There is a glimmer of light [in the increased investment] but this is still quite meagre compared to other continents in the global south,” Muyungi said.\n",
      "Last year’s imported panels would add about 5% to current electricity generation capacity in 16 countries, according to Ember, but the need remains vast. About 600 million people in Africa lack access to electricity, and about a billion have only firewood or dirty fuels for cooking. Women and girls are worst affected.\n",
      "Melaku Yirga, the regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation, said: “Renewable energy is not only Africa’s greatest opportunity, it is also an urgent necessity. Renewable power enables everything from irrigation and food storage to early-warning systems, healthcare and livelihoods.”\n",
      "While recent increases in renewable energy investment were welcome, Yirga said the public sector and overseas aid were still vital.\n",
      "“Africa has no shortage of ambition in renewable energy, but without stronger international finance and the right incentives, the private sector will remain on the sidelines and adaptation goals will go unmet,” he said.\n",
      "“Private sector financing must be met with public commitments, and funding must also be long-term and reliable – short grants rarely achieve full impact, as meaningful engagement with governments and communities takes time and requires significant upfront investment.”\n",
      "Reductions in overseas aid from rich countries are causing consternation among African governments, many of which are blighted by record debt burdens, exacerbated by the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent interest rate rises.\n",
      "Macky Sall, the former president of Senegal, said: “The drop in official development assistance fundamentally changes the climate calculus. Where does that leave Africa, if we can no longer count on our partners’ promises?\n",
      "“The costs of the climate crisis have fallen most heavily on Africa. We are not the cause. We are not only footing the largest bill – we are also seeing the cheques to stem the damage cancelled.”\n",
      "Private sector companies will put cash into renewable energy, but few will help Africa adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, which are already being felt in the form of droughts, floods and crop failures. Investment to build resilience – such as water storage systems, better infrastructure and new farming techniques – is lacking.\n",
      "A report published at the summit on Monday showed that while Africa needed at least $70bn a year to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis, and possibly much more, only $15bn was provided in adaptation finance to the continent in 2023.\n",
      "Without urgent action to address that vast financing gap, Africa’s future costs from climate impacts will balloon, wiping out a fifth of GDP by 2050.\n",
      "Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation thinktank, says rich countries must increase their finance for adaptation in Africa, which is responsible for just 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions while bearing the brunt of climate breakdown.\n",
      "“Europe [and other countries] will shoot themselves in the foot if they defund ODA,” he said. “African leaders will see it as a stab in the back.”\n",
      "While Africa is behind in climate adaptation, its riches are increasingly sought after by China and the rest of the rich world.\n",
      "Africa boasts some of the biggest deposits of “critical minerals” – elements vital to building renewable energy components. Cobalt, lithium, copper, nickel, rare earths and other minerals are abundant in parts of Africa, which has spurred a global scramble for the resources.\n",
      "Human rights abuses have soared in some mining areas, with child labour and the exploitation of adult workers, particularly women, in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa’s under-resourced public sector is struggling to contain the damage and ensure resource extraction is done responsibly, without causing environmental devastation and in a way that benefits local people.\n",
      "Africa also abounds in gas, with reserves of the fossil fuel that have scarcely been tapped in some countries. Muyungi insisted they must be allowed to exploit those resources, despite the impact on the climate crisis. “We do not envisage anything to stop us using gas – we need it for our development,” he said.\n",
      "For rich countries to tackle the climate crisis, Africa’s assistance will be essential. If global north governments fail to address the continent’s needs, they will feel the impact. Roughly 60% of Africa’s population is under 25, a “youthquake” that could spur development or, if poorly handled, will be felt around the world.\n",
      "Abay Yimere, a scholar at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University in the US, said: “If the climate crisis is not tackled in Africa, that will be a problem for migration. If we do not provide them with jobs, and adapt to climate change, the impact will be huge and not controllable. The global north should look at this from their own national perspectives and see where their interest lies.”\n",

      "Aid cuts in east Africa have led to cases of babies being born with HIV because mothers could not get medication, a rise in life-threatening infections, and at least one woman having an unwanted abortion, according to interviews with medical staff, patients and experts.\n",
      "A report by Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) sets out dozens of examples of the impact of disruption to Pepfar – the president’s emergency plan for aids relief – in Tanzania and Uganda.\n",
      "Pepfar, a leading US global health programme, launched in 2003 and is credited with saving millions of lives, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "The report is based on interviews with 39 doctors, nurses, people living with HIV, service providers and other experts. It focuses on the first 100 days after Pepfar-funded programmes were instructed to stop work as part of a US government freeze on foreign aid.\n",
      "Health workers reported shortages of drugs to control the virus, resulting in increased serious infections in people living with HIV and children being born with the virus because mothers could not get medication to prevent it being passed on. Clinics have closed, and people are skipping vital doses to eke out their supply of medication, raising the risk of drug-resistance.\n",
      "Some programmes have been able to resume activities in the months since the interviews, said Emily Bass, one of the report’s authors, offering “temporary mitigation” of the harms, but there exists a “narrow window” for the US Congress to act to secure resources that will stabilise remaining services and prevent the loss of decades of progress.\n",
      "The Trump administration is reportedly refusing to release about half of the $6bn (£4.5bn) funding allocated by Congress for Pepfar in the 2025 fiscal year.\n",
      "In Tanzania and Uganda, HIV prevention and treatment programmes were reliant on Pepfar. The stop work order meant clinics were unable to dispense drugs bought with US money for several days, before a waiver came through allowing treatment to continue.\n",
      "Even then, disruption to supply chains meant doctors could not dispense as many drugs as usual, they said, perhaps giving patients supplies for a few weeks rather than months. Rumours spread that normal access was unlikely to return.\n",
      "A mental health project research coordinator told PHR: “Someone did an abortion because of that rumour [that antiretrovirals were no longer available]. She said, ‘Oh well, I don’t want to have a baby who is HIV positive. I will be blamed myself, so I don’t want.’”\n",
      "By late April, one clinic reported that 25% of the pregnant women living with HIV that it supported had given birth to a child with HIV. Its clinician said drugs had not been delivered and existing stocks would not stretch far enough.\n",
      "The US government waiver allowed HIV prevention programmes to continue only for pregnant or breastfeeding women. It left key at-risk groups unprotected – in Tanzania and Uganda, LGBTQ+ people, sex workers and people who use drugs face criminalisation and stigma.\n",
      "Specialist services making it easier for them to access care have been hardest hit, the report found, warning of worsening discrimination when those people sought help from mainstream government clinics.\n",
      "The report also found that people’s trust in domestic government, US foreign aid and antiretroviral medications had been damaged. Many said they feared a “dark” future, anticipating increased costs for care and opportunists pushing fake cures.\n",
      "The US government must “immediately restore, renew, preserve and protect global health funding for essential HIV services, including full funding commensurate with need for global HIV programs in the FY 2026 budget, and subsequently reauthorise the Pepfar program”, the authors concluded, so that there can be “a planned, feasible, and transparent transition to country leadership and ownership of programs”.\n",

      "Lawyers for five men deported by the US to Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, said they are being denied proper access to their clients, who they said are being imprisoned illegally.\n",
      "The men from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Yemen and Cuba have criminal convictions, but had all served their sentences and been released in the US, their lawyers said. The US deported them to the small southern African country without warning in July, claiming they were “depraved monsters”.\n",
      "The US has sent migrants to several third countries, as Donald Trump’s administration ramps up deportations. Eight men were sent to South Sudan in July, Rwanda accepted seven migrants last week and Uganda has agreed to take in asylum seekers. The US also deported 252 Venezuelans, first sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvador for four months.\n",
      "The lawyers said they have been unable to have private conversations with their clients, who are allowed one short video call a week in the presence of prison staff. A local lawyer representing the five men has been prevented from visiting them in the maximum security Matsapha correctional centre.\n",
      "The Eswatini lawyer filed a case demanding access to the men, but a hearing scheduled for Monday was postponed when the judge did not show up, said Alma David, who is representing the Yemeni and Cuban men.\n",
      "When the men, who had all been in the US since they were children, were first deported, US assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed they were “so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.”\n",
      "In response, Jamaica’s foreign minister, Kamina Smith, said: “The government has not refused the return of any of our nationals to Jamaica,” and would work to return any deportees to the country. She later said that diplomats visited Orville Etoria in prison in Eswatini on 21 August and found him “in good spirits”.\n",
      "Etoria, 62, came to the US legally in 1976, aged 12, said his lawyer Mia Unger, of the Legal Aid Society. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison in 1997. He obtained an undergraduate degree in prison, was released on parole in 2021 and was working in a men’s shelter and studying for a master’s degree in divinity when he was deported.\n",
      "He had been reporting to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as required and obtained a Jamaican passport earlier this year at their request. His relatives told Unger he had first been put on a plane to Jamaica and then removed, she said, adding that his being sent to Eswatini “makes no sense”.\n",
      "Relatives of the four other men did not want their identities disclosed, their lawyers said. The Yemeni man, who served 22 years in prison for murder and was released in 2020, had been living in Michigan and is 70, David said.\n",
      "The Cuban man is in his mid-50s and had been working for a plumbing company in Florida. David said he had served a nine-year sentence ending in 1996 for attempted murder, and a three-year sentence ending in 2012 for grand theft auto.\n",
      "David said she had spoken to both men while all five deportees were with guards and the prison chief, who said that only the US embassy in Eswatini could grant access to the men. “Since when does the US embassy have jurisdiction over Eswatini’s national prisons?” she said.\n",
      "Tin Thanh Nguyen, representing the Vietnamese and Laotian deportees, said the men were aged 34 and 45 and released in 2015 and 2023 respectively. The Laotian man’s relatives reported he was starting to show signs of depression.\n",
      "“The United States is outsourcing their detention … to purge the United States of immigrants and refugees and to make a spectacle of deportations,” Nguyen said.\n",
      "Last month, a group of Eswatini NGOs challenged the country’s acceptance of the deportees on constitutional grounds, arguing that parliament had not been consulted and that the men’s human rights were being violated.\n",
      "An Eswatini government spokesperson said they would not be responding while court cases were under way.\n",
      "Ice and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

      "More than 1,000 people have been killed in a landslide in western Sudan, according to a rebel group that controls the area.\n",
      "The landslide on Sunday, which followed heavy rain, destroyed the village of Tarasin in the Marra mountains area of western Sudan and left only one survivor, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM) said.\n",
      "“Initial information indicates the death of all village residents, estimated to be more than 1,000 individuals, with only one survivor,” its statement said.\n",
      "The SLM, which controls the area located in the Darfur region, appealed to the UN and international aid agencies to help recover the bodies. The village “has now been completely levelled to the ground”, the statement said.\n",
      "Footage shared by the Marra Mountains news outlet showed a flattened area between mountain ranges and a group of people searching the area.\n",
      "Luca Renda, the UN humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, said he was “deeply saddened” by the reported landslide, adding that local sources indicated that “between 300 and 1,000 people may have lost their lives”. He said the UN and its partners were mobilising to support the affected communities.\n",
      "Al-Amin Abdallah Abbas, a farmer from Ammo, a cluster of villages that includes Tarasin, said the area had experienced weeks of heavy rainfall. He told the Associated Press that tribal and community leaders in nearby areas had mobilised efforts to recover and bury the victims. “The village and its people disappeared,” he said. “It’s an unprecedented tragedy.”\n",
      "Sunday’s landslide was one of the deadliest natural disasters in the recent history of Sudan, where hundreds of people die every year as a result of seasonal rainfall between July and October.\n",
      "Sudan’s civil war, now in its third year, has plunged the country into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with famine declared in parts of Darfur.\n",
      "Fighting between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has escalated in Darfur, especially in El Fasher, since the army took control of the capital, Khartoum, in March.\n",
      "The Marra mountains area has turned into a hub for displaced families fleeing fighting in and around El Fasher. The SLM has mostly stayed out of the fighting but controls parts of Sudan’s tallest mountain range.\n",
      "Darfur’s army-aligned governor, Minni Minnawi, called the landslide a “humanitarian tragedy that goes beyond the borders of the region”.\n",
      "“We appeal to international humanitarian organisations to urgently intervene and provide support and assistance at this critical moment, for the tragedy is greater than what our people can bear alone,” he said in a statement.\n",
      "Much of Darfur – including the area where the landslide occurred – remains largely inaccessible to international aid organisations because of the continuing fighting, severely limiting the delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance.\n",
      "Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, the chair of the African Union Commission, called on the warring parties “to silence the guns and unite in facilitating the swift and effective delivery of emergency humanitarian assistance”.\n",
      "The fighting in Sudan has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, including about 4 million from the capital alone.\n",
      "Hundreds have been reported killed in recent months, and civilians in El Fasher say the paramilitaries are now waging their fiercest ever assault on the North Darfur state capital.\n",
      "The war has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and rights groups. The international criminal court has said it is investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n",

      "Sixty-nine people drowned when a vessel full of migrants overturned off the coast of Mauritania earlier this week, coastguard officials said on Friday.\n",
      "The accident occurred late on Tuesday after passengers on the boat spotted the lights of a coastal town about 50 miles (80km) north of the capital, Nouakchott, prompting the occupants to press to one side of the boat, causing it to capsize, Mohamed Abdallah, the head of the coastguard, told reporters.\n",
      "“When the migrants saw the lights of the Mheijrat, they tried to move to one part of the boat, causing it to capsize,” Abdallah said.\n",
      "The boat is understood to have left the Gambia a week ago, carrying about 160 people, including Senegalese and Gambian nationals.\n",
      "The initial death toll was reported as 49, but a subsequent count by the official raised the number to 69. Seventeen survivors were pulled from the water by one of the coastguard’s patrols.\n",
      "Thousands of would-be migrants have died in recent years during the dangerous maritime passage between Africa and Europe. According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), at least 8,938 people died in 2024 attempting to cross borders.\n",
      "Travellers who pass through Mauritania usually come from neighbouring countries including Senegal and Mali, and are trying to reach Europe. But strong ocean currents and the fragile condition of the vessels make the long crossing perilous. Some people also try to go through the Sahara, which comprises 90% of Mauritanian territory, braving temperatures above 45C.\n",
      "Human Rights Watch has reported abuses of migrants by Mauritanian security officials.\n",
      "In a 142-page report released on Wednesday, HRW said it had documented “police use of prolonged, painful restraints, limited food and water, and other mistreatment” in a crackdown funded since 2024 by a €210m (£182m) deal with the EU.\n",
      "Authorities in Nouakchott have not yet responded to the report, which has caused debate in government and humanitarian circles this week.\n",
