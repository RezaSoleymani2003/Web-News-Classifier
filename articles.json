    "raw_text": "When a history of resistance to the lurching authoritarianism of Donald Trump’s second presidency is written, it could well begin on 11 April 2025, inside a small immigration courtroom in remote, central Louisiana.\nIt was there, in the early afternoon, that a slight young man dressed in a blue uniform jumpsuit spoke calmly but directly to the new administration – away from the gaze of television cameras and 1,000 miles (1,610km) from his friends and family. Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and Palestinian organiser, had been arrested a month earlier – snatched from the lobby of his Manhattan apartment building as he returned home with his wife. Now, detained in the small town of Jena, he sat before a judge who had just ruled that he was eligible to be deported from the United States purely for his political views.\nKhalil asked for permission to speak. He paused for a moment, before sharply rebuking the jurist who continued to hold his fate in her hands by throwing her own words back at her. He reminded her that she had guaranteed that the court would ensure him “due process” and “fundamental fairness”.\n“Neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,” he told her, in effect branding the venue a kangaroo court. “This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family.”\nI was one of a handful of journalists in Jena that day. It was a period of particular distress in the US, his arrest being the first of a spate of high-profile detentions of students seized off the streets by immigration agents over their political views. In that moment of fear, when so many were going silent, I was taken aback by the quiet courage that seemed to come so naturally to Khalil even as formal political opposition to Trump’s iron fist had largely faltered.\nFour months on, and now bailed from detention and back in New York, I ask Khalil where it had come from and whether he would define it as an act of bravery.\n“No. I have always believed in standing up against injustice,” he says in his gentle voice. “I knew that it was predetermined. That it was a play. It was theatre. I did not want to play within their rules.”\nOn a bright summer’s day in Brooklyn, Khalil invites me to his new apartment that commands a towering view over the borough’s low-rises. The walls are freshly painted white – he had moved in just a few weeks earlier – and we sit on a grey sofa by the window. His four-month-old son, Deen, is crying softly in the next room as Noor Abdalla, his wife, soothes him.\nIt is an archetypal scene of a young New York family: a baby rocker sits beside a large TV, white tulips lean against a ceramic vase, bright artwork adorns the walls. Khalil is warm and candid, he offers me chocolate and water before we start talking. But the grim reality of his situation soon lingers as we dial an attorney from his legal team who listens in to our three-hour conversation as a precaution.\nAlthough he is free from detention, the Trump administration’s case against him is still winding through the courts. While he is a legal permanent resident, he acknowledges deportation could still be the ultimate outcome.\n“This administration is trying to do everything in its power – and beyond its power, in fact – to punish me and deport me,” he says. “Up until very recently, they were trying to rearrest me.”\nHe is working on contingency plans for if and when that happens, he acknowledges, without describing specifics. For now, he has attempted to return to a degree of normality. He spends his days with baby Deen, learning to be a father after he missed the birth while detained. He recently rode the subway for the first time since his release, but still finds himself looking over his shoulder. The move to Brooklyn was partly to create distance from Columbia’s campus and all the past wounds of its recent history. But still, it remains difficult to focus.\nA Palestinian refugee, intimately familiar with the experience of repeated displacement, he remains resolute in the face of a prospective fresh exile.\n“Even if I am deported, I would continue to speak out for Palestine,” he says.\nKhalil’s life was changed forever when agents in plainclothes came to his old apartment back in March. His arrest, captured on video by Abdalla, marked a turning point as Trump ramped up his era of mass deportations and began a censorship campaign against the campuses that saw large protests of Israel’s war in Gaza. Khalil remained calm as he was placed in handcuffs and driven away, with his wife – heavily pregnant – left on the sidewalk, desperately calling their lawyer.\nI wonder if he has ever watched the video back?\nHe shakes his head.\n“It is a moment I would never want to remember,” he says. “It was one of the most difficult, scariest moments in my life. I do not want to watch a moment where I was helpless to support Noor.”\nHis overwhelming memory of that night is his fear that Abdalla, a US citizen, might also face arrest. He repeated her phone number in his head so as not to forget it. But he also remembers making “chill” small talk with the arresting agents as he was driven away. They spoke about the iftar dinner, the breaking-fast meal taken during Ramadan, he had just eaten.\n“I did not fear them whatsoever,” he recalls. “I saw them eye to eye.”\nShortly after the arrest, he overheard an incoming phone call from the White House, requesting an update. He was then presented with a document that accused him of no crime, but argued his presence in the US compromised foreign policy interests. (A memo signed by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, disclosed later, argued this was due to participation in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities”.)\nHe read it and laughed in disbelief.\n“Are they really going this far in coming after me?” he thought.\nAfter 36 hours of travel under guard, he ended up in Jena, the sprawling centre four hours from New Orleans, hidden away in a pine forest by a country road. It is known as one of the harshest immigration jails in the US. Inside his large detention dormitory, the TV was blaring and he saw Trump at a press conference on the White House lawn perusing Teslas with Elon Musk.\nThe president was asked about Khalil’s arrest.\n“We ought to get him the hell out of the country,” Trump replied.\nIt was at this point he started to realise the enormity of it all – a public narrative about him spiralling out of his control, laundered through a vast rightwing disinformation infrastructure branding him an antisemite and terrorism supporter.\n“Who I am has been skewed so much,” he recalls thinking. “I was like: ‘Damn my future is basically done … my reputation, my career aspirations.’”\nBut through the horror, he says he knew his record would ultimately speak for itself. “That was my salvation,” he says. “I was 100% confident I had a very clean history. They would be able to get no dirt on me.”\nHe spoke to Abdalla by phone. She was safe. She told him about an outpouring of support across the world. He sighed with relief.\nThat quiet courage, which Khalil has carried throughout this ordeal, has been forged since childhood, at the multiple junctures he was forced to upend his life.\nHe was born in a small Palestinian refugee camp named Khan Eshieh on the outskirts of Damascus, the youngest of four brothers. His paternal grandparents were displaced from their farmland outside of Tiberias, in what is now Israel, during the Nakba of 1948. His father was a welder who left school at the age of 10. His mother, a low-level civil servant, ended her education at 16.\nHis Palestinian identity was omnipresent growing up; most of his neighbours were displaced from the same region as his grandparents. And his grandmother, who was illiterate, would tell stories of her life in Palestine, always with a view to eventual return.\n“You could see the struggle in her face,” he says.\nHis parents, both largely apolitical, instilled in him the values of a formal education and he excelled, graduating with aspirations to become a commercial pilot. But the forces of history had other plans. The final few years of his schooling in Syria coincided with the pro-democracy movements that swept across the region during the Arab spring. One of his first forays into formal activism came on 15 May 2011, as part of a series of “Nakba Day” demonstrations at Israel’s borders. At least a dozen protesters were killed during the clashes with Israeli forces. Dozens more were injured.\nKhalil was one of them. Aged 16, he was shot in the leg and spent a number of days in hospital. “That was the first real encounter of violence, direct violence, by Israel against me,” he says.\nThe experience propelled him further into the tumultuous politics of the era – initially heady and full of promise before quickly deteriorating into state brutality and civil war. He witnessed the crackdowns of the Assad regime on close friends and family who helped provide shelter to Syrians fleeing Damascus. Khalil became involved in organising smaller acts of resistance: street protests, spray painting and posting anti-Assad comments on social media.\n“These things were the very minimum we could do,” he says. “In a time where you know that injustices are happening around you, staying silent is complicity. Pure complicity.”\nIt all intensified after graduating high school. He had been set to study aerospace engineering at the University of Aleppo, but the city was burning as the civil war raged. On 11 January 2013, a week after he turned 18, two of his childhood friends and co-organisers named Bashar and Ali were snatched off the street by Syrian intelligence officers. He feared he would be next.\nThe same night he made plans to flee, crossing the border into Lebanon the next day. “I left everything behind,” he says. “I fled without a plan. My biggest worry was that they would confess the names of the people around them. And you wouldn’t blame them to confess under such torture by the regime.”\nBashar and Ali were murdered after their arrest, their deaths confirmed only a few months ago after the Assad regime collapsed at the end of 2024.\nKhalil recognises the different shades of authoritarianism he has faced throughout his life.\n“What shocked me at the very beginning, when I was kidnapped [by US immigration], was just how reminiscent that was to cases I witnessed in Syria,” he says. “You would have plainclothed officers without any warrant come and take you just because of your political speech.”\nKhalil languished in Jena for more than 100 days. He had known little about the US’s deportation machine, and the detention center’s reputation as a legal black hole, until he experienced it all.\nHe slept in a large dorm room lined with bunkbeds, holding about 70 men. He spent time dictating well-written dispatches over the phone to his legal team. He read literature: Out of Place, the autobiography of the Palestinian academic Edward Said; Man’s Search for Meaning, the psychologist Viktor Frankl’s memoir of surviving the Holocaust. But mostly he shared stories with the other men detained with him. Many had been picked up during routine check-ins with immigration officials. Others were recently apprehended at the southern border. A few had been detained in Jena for more than a year. The majority of people who pass through immigration court in Jena have no lawyers as mandatory legal representation is not guaranteed.\nOne man, a Georgian national, had been held for about eight months, picked up with his wife in California. Held in separate detention centres about two hours apart, the couple, who were fleeing Georgia’s new pro-Russia government, had not been able to speak to each other since their arrest. The man, a carpenter, spent hours fashioning improvised rosaries from commissary items, including crayon, ground coffee and bread – hardened into beads by heat in a microwave. Khalil shows me a set, still impressed by the ingenuity.\nMany of the men, Khalil says, have since been removed from the US.\nFor Khalil, the lowest moment came on the night his son was born. His requests for a furlough to attend the birth were denied and so he was forced to listen on the phone in the middle of the night, whispering quiet words of encouragement as Abdalla laboured. The line cut around 2am, and by the time he called back he heard his newborn son crying in the background. He whispered the call to prayer down the line to welcome baby Deen into the world.\n“It was a very difficult moment that I don’t wish anyone to go through,” he says, his eyes drifting. “It was a clear act of cruelty just to punish me.”\nAbdalla emerges to say hello with Deen in her arms. Khalil’s face lights up. At four months, his son has a full head of hair, deep dimples and expressive brown eyes that follow his father around the room.\nI ask her how it feels to have her husband back.\n“Not having him for the first two months of Deen’s life was hard,” she says. “We missed a lot of milestones that you can’t get back. So we are catching up on lost time.”\nThe new apartment is their “safe space”, she says. The couple have been largely welcomed with open arms here, receiving spontaneous acts of kindness: an unexpected free lunch, smiles on the street. I am the first journalist they have invited over.\nKhalil met his future wife, now a dentist, in Lebanon in 2016, while working for a non-profit helping educate Syrian refugees. She visited on an exchange program. He had worked his way up from nothing after fleeing Syria, taking construction jobs during the day and volunteering for a refugee charity in the evenings, which granted him free room and board in their office. Eventually he attended university to study computer science and took remedial English classes. He gradually let go of his dream to fly commercial jets, becoming more immersed in the work of government and bureaucracy.\nKhalil and Abdalla bonded over games of backgammon and stayed in touch after she returned home to Flint, Michigan. He was attracted to her kindness and gentle nature. She found his intellect and ambition appealing, and eventually pushed him to apply for a job at the British embassy, where he worked on Syria policy until moving to New York in 2023. Their long-distance relationship lasted seven years.\nI ask how fatherhood has changed him since he returned home.\n“It absolutely makes me think [more] about risks,” he acknowledges. “When you have someone depending on you, you want them to have as normal a life as possible. But at the same time it pushes me towards advocacy. When I see Deen I always remember the children who are being killed because of Israel, who don’t have the luxury of being in New York. [I think of] immigrant children who don’t have the luxury of having an American passport that would somehow protect them.”\nBut Palestinian liberation is never far from his imagination.\n“I want Deen to be able to visit his home town, his ancestors’ town, and live equally with everyone,” he says.\nThe pro-Gaza protests at Columbia marked the first time Khalil had ever assumed a public-facing role. Having set his sights on a behind-the-scenes job in government bureaucracy, he was instead thrust into a spring of campus tumult in 2024 as students constructed encampments, staged rallies and, in late April, occupied the university’s Hamilton Hall, leading to an overwhelming police response.\nKhalil served as a negotiator with the university’s administration, presenting students’ demands, including divestment from companies with ties to Israel. He was not present on campus during the Hamilton Hall occupation.\nThe negotiations were protracted but civil. A Columbia administrator, anonymously quoted in the New York Times, later described Khalil as “thoughtful, passionate, and principled, sometimes to the point of rigidity”. It strikes me as apt, but I wonder if he agrees?\n“Pretty much,” he says, smiling. “I don’t know about rigidity though, because it was not my position, it was the students’.”\nUnlike many of those on the protest frontlines, Khalil did not wear a face mask, leaving him vulnerable to online doxing from hardline pro-Israel groups, which have supplied the Trump administration with lists of candidates for deportation.\n“I have never worn a mask during a protest because I knew that the purpose of doxing was to intimidate us, to silence us,” he says. But the campaign ramped up again after the election of Trump, shortly before Khalil’s arrest. He had not foreseen how dangerous it might become.\nThe allegations of antisemitism have never been substantiated with hard evidence. Khalil says Jewish students played an “integral” role in organising the campus protests and argues it is Israel and the Trump administration’s policies that fuel global antisemitism through their policies.\nSo how does he visualise a free Palestine?\n“I imagine it as a place where everyone lives in dignity, freedom, equality, regardless of who they are, where they come from,” he says. “I don’t think there’s an alternative to that, to have a lasting and just peace in the Middle East.\n“Liberation doesn’t mean throwing anyone out. Liberation means liberating everyone, whether the oppressed or the oppressors.”\nKhalil remains scathing of Columbia’s response to the protests and its later capitulation to the Trump administration’s demands it suppress pro-Palestinian protest. Yet he expresses an honest sadness that he was unable to walk the stage to collect his master’s degree in May this year. He is the first in his family to graduate from university. His parents had planned to travel from Germany, where they now live, to witness it. He had bought his gown a year in advance.\n“I know it would have been an incredibly important moment for my parents, who have fought and sacrificed so much for me to get to this point,” he says. Instead, he received the accolade as an emailed PDF file.\nIt was late June when Khalil emerged from Jena on a sweltering humid afternoon. He raised his fist in the air to celebrate and walked towards a small group of journalists. He had lost about 15lbs (6.8kg). A federal judge in New Jersey had just ordered his release, having found the Trump administration’s foreign policy argument was likely unconstitutional.\nI had asked him that day to respond in his own words to the “threat” label that Trump had branded him with. “Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this,” he told me.\nI had not fully comprehended what he meant by “the wrong person” at the time. But as our conversation comes to a close, it becomes clear. The adversity that Khalil has faced – from displacement to detention – in such a short span of life has only fuelled his sense of mission. He will not be forced into submission or silence. He views his past and future as inextricable from the wider Palestinian struggle stretching from 1948 to the current slaughter in Gaza. “It is a drop in the sea of Palestinian sorrow and grief, where families are being erased, children are being killed, houses being raided and dignity is eroded,” he says.\nHe takes a moment before we wrap up, seemingly a little exhausted.\n“My story is just a small story,” he says. “A story of how violence against Palestinians can be transported around the world.”"

    "raw_text": "If this were happening somewhere else – in Latin America, say – how might it be reported? Having secured his grip on the capital, the president is now set to send troops to several rebel-held cities, claiming he is wanted there to restore order. The move follows raids on the homes of leading dissidents and comes as armed men seen as loyal to the president, many of them masked, continue to pluck people off the streets …\nExcept this is happening in the United States of America and so we don’t quite talk about it that way. That’s not the only reason. It’s also because Donald Trump’s march towards authoritarianism is so steady, taking another step or two every day, that it’s easy to become inured to it: you can’t be in a state of shock permanently. And, besides, sober-minded people are wary of sounding hyperbolic or hysterical: their instinct is to play down rather than scream at the top of their voice.\nThere’s something else, too. Trump’s dictator-like behaviour is so brazen, so blatant, that paradoxically, we discount it. It’s like being woken in the night by a burglar wearing a striped shirt and carrying a bag marked “Swag”: we would assume it was a joke or a stunt or otherwise unreal, rather than a genuine danger. So it is with Trump. We cannot quite believe what we are seeing.\nBut here is what we are seeing. Trump has deployed the national guard on the streets of Washington DC, so that there are now 2,000 troops, heavily armed, patrolling the capital. The pretext is fighting crime, but violent crime in DC was at a 30-year low when he made his move. The president has warned that Chicago will be next, perhaps Baltimore too. In June he sent the national guard and the marines into Los Angeles to put down protests against his immigration policies, protests which the administration said amounted to an “insurrection”. Demonstrators were complaining about the masked men of Ice, the immigration agency that, thanks to Trump, now has a budget to match that of the world’s largest armies, snatching people from street corners or hauling them from their cars.\nThose cities are all run by Democrats and, not coincidentally, have large Black populations. They are potential centres of opposition to Trump’s rule and he wants them under his control. The constitution’s insistence that states have powers of their own and that the reach of the federal government should be limited – a principle that until recently was sacred to Republicans – can go hang.\nControl is the goal, amassing power in the hands of the president and removing or neutering any institution or person that could stand in his way. That is the guiding logic that explains Trump’s every action, large and small, including his wars on the media, the courts, the universities and the civil servants of the federal government. It helps explain why FBI agents last week mounted a 7am raid on the home and office of John Bolton, once Trump’s national security adviser and now one of his most vocal critics. And why the president hinted darkly that the former New Jersey governor Chris Christie is in his sights.\nIt’s why he has broken all convention, and possibly US law, by attempting to remove Lisa Cook as a member of the board of the Federal Reserve on unproven charges of mortgage fraud. Those charges are based on information helpfully supplied by the Trump loyalist installed as federal housing director and who, according to the New York Times, has repeatedly leveraged “the powers of his office … to investigate or attack Mr Trump’s most recognisable political enemies”. The pattern is clear: Trump is using the institutions of government to hound his foes in a manner that recalls the worst of Richard Nixon – though where Nixon skulked in the shadows, Trump’s abuses are in plain sight.\nAnd all in the pursuit of ever more power. Take the firing of Cook. With falling poll numbers, especially on his handling of the economy, he craves the sugar rush of an interest rate cut. The independent central bank won’t give it to him, so he wants to push the Fed out of the way and grab the power to set interest rates himself. Note the justification offered by JD Vance this week, that Trump is “much better able to make those determinations” than “unelected bureaucrats” because he embodies the will of the people. The reasoning is pure authoritarianism, arguing that a core principle of the US constitution, the separation of powers, should be swept aside, because all legitimate authority resides in one man alone.\nOf course, the greatest check on Trump would come from the opposition winning power in a democratic election, specifically Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives in November 2026. Trump is working hard to make that impossible: witness this month’s unabashed gerrymander in Texas, where at Trump’s command, Republicans redrew congressional boundaries to give themselves five more safe seats in the House. Trump wants more states to follow Texas’s lead, because a Democratic-controlled House would have powers of scrutiny that he rightly fears.\nMeanwhile, apparently prompted by his meeting with Vladimir Putin, he is once again at war against postal voting, baselessly decrying it as fraudulent, while also demanding a new census that would exclude undocumented migrants – moves that will either help Republicans win in 2026 or else enable him to argue that a Democratic victory was illegitimate and should be overturned.\nIn that same spirit, the Trump White House now argues that, in effect, only one party should be allowed to exercise power in the US. How else to read the words of key Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who this week told Fox News that “The Democrat party is not a political party; it is a domestic extremist organisation.”\nIt’s the same picture on every front, whether it’s plans for a new military parade in Trump’s honour or the firing of health officials who insist on putting science ahead of political loyalty. He is bent on amassing power to himself and being seen to amass power to himself, even if that means departing from economic conservative orthodoxy to have the federal government take a stake in hitherto private companies. He wants to rule over every aspect of US life. As Trump himself said this week, “A lot of people are saying, ‘Maybe we’d like a dictator.’” The former Obama adviser David Axelrod is not alone when he says, “We have gone from zero to Hungary faster than I ever imagined.”\nThe trouble is, people still don’t talk about it the way they talk about Hungary, not inside the US and not outside it. That’s partly the It Can’t Happen Here mindset, partly a reluctance to accept a reality that would require, of foreign governments especially, a rethink of almost everything. If the US is on its way to autocracy, in a condition scholars might call “unconsolidated authoritarianism”, then that changes Britain’s entire strategic position, its place in the world, which for 80 years has been predicated on the notion of a west led by a stable, democratic US. The same goes for the EU. Far easier to carry on, either pretending that the transformation of the US is not, in fact, as severe as it is, or that normal service will resume shortly. But the world’s leaders, like US citizens, cannot ignore the evidence indefinitely. To adapt the title of that long-ago novel, it can happen here – and it is.\n-\nJonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate and Palestinian organizer, is eligible to be deported from the United States, an immigration judge ruled on Friday during a contentious hearing at a remote court in central Louisiana.\nThe decision sides with the Trump administration’s claim that a short memo written by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, which stated Khalil’s “current or expected beliefs, statements or associations” were counter to foreign policy interests, is sufficient evidence to remove a lawful permanent resident from the United States. The undated memo, the main piece of evidence submitted by the government, contained no allegations of criminal conduct.\nDuring a tense hearing on Friday afternoon, Khalil’s attorneys made an array of unsuccessful arguments attempting to both delay a ruling on his eligibility for removal and to terminate proceedings entirely. They argued the broad allegations contained in Rubio’s memo gave them a right to directly cross-examine him.\nKhalil held prayer beads as three attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security presented arguments for his removal.\nJudge Jamee Comans ruled that Rubio’s determination was “presumptive and sufficient evidence” and that she had no power to rule on concerns over free speech.\n“There is no indication that Congress contemplated an immigration judge or even the attorney general overruling the secretary of state on matters of foreign policy,” Comans said.\nA supporter who was in tears sat on the crowded public benches as the ruling was delivered.\nFollowing the ruling, Khalil, who had remained silent throughout proceedings, requested permission to speak before the court.\nAddressing the judge directly, he said: “I would like to quote what you said last time, that ‘there’s nothing that’s more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness’.”\nHe continued: “Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process.\n“This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family. I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me is afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.”\nKhalil, 30, helped lead pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last year. He was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers in New York on 8 March and transferred to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he has been detained for over a month. His case was the first in a string of Ice arrests instigated by the Trump administration targeting pro-Palestinian students and scholars present in the US on visas or green cards.\nThe ruling means that Khalil’s removal proceedings will continue to move forward in Jena, while a separate case being heard in federal court in New Jersey examines the legality of his detention and questions surrounding the constitutionality of the government’s claims it can deport people for first amendment-protected speech if they are deemed adverse to US foreign policy.\nKhalil’s legal team is asking the New Jersey judge to release him on bail so that he can reunite with his wife, who is due to give birth to their first child this month.\nHis lawyers slammed the decision, which they said appeared to be prewritten. “Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent. This is not over, and our fight continues,” said Marc van der Hout, Khalil’s immigration lawyer.\n“If Mahmoud can be targeted in this way, simply for speaking out for Palestinians and exercising his constitutionally protected right to free speech, this can happen to anyone over any issue the Trump administration dislikes. We will continue working tirelessly until Mahmoud is free and rightfully returned home to his family and community.”\nVan der Hout told a federal judge that Khalil will file the appeal after the immigration judge who ruled him “removable” issues the final written ruling. Van der Hout added that Khalil’s legal team may also pursue an asylum case.\n“So nothing is going to happen quickly in the immigration proceeding even though she’s found him removable on the foreign policy grounds,” he said.\nThe judge gave lawyers for Khalil until 23 April to seek a waiver.\nDuring a short prayer vigil held outside the detention centre on Friday afternoon, a group of interfaith clergy read messages of support. A short statement from Khalil’s wife, Noor Abdalla, who is due to give birth this month, was also delivered in front of reporters.\n“Today’s decision feels like a devastating blow to our family. No person should be deemed ‘removable’ from their home for speaking out against the killing of Palestinian families, doctors, and journalists,” the statement read.\nIt continued: “In less than a month, Mahmoud and I will welcome our first child. Until we are reunited, I will not stop advocating for my husband’s safe return home.”\nThe New Jersey judge has ordered the government not to remove Khalil as his case plays out in federal court. A hearing in that case is set for later on Friday."

    "raw_text": "Fearing legal repercussions, online harassment and professional consequences, student journalists are retracting their names from published articles amid intensifying repression by the Trump administration targeting students perceived to be associated with the pro-Palestinian movement.\nEditors at university newspapers say that anxiety among writers has risen since the arrest of the Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, who is currently in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention fighting efforts to deport her. While the government has not pointed to evidence supporting its decision to revoke her visa, she wrote an op-ed last year in a student newspaper critical of Israel, spurring fears that simply expressing views in writing is now viewed as sufficient grounds for deportation.\nOzturk is one of nearly a dozen students or scholars who have been seized by immigration officials since 8 March, when Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia graduate student and green card holder, was arrested and placed in deportation proceedings over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. Student editors report particularly acute anxieties among international students who have contributed to their newspapers, but say that requests to take down stories over fears of retaliation are coming from US citizens, too.\nAt Columbia University, Adam Kinder, the editor of the Columbia Political Review, said his publication has been asked to take down nearly a dozen articles and halt the publication process of over a dozen more in response to mounting pressure in recent weeks. His team has complied with those requests. “For students who disagree with the Trump administration’s stance, they fear real retaliation,” Kinder said.\nAt Stanford University, the Stanford Daily has also seen a surge in takedown requests in recent weeks, according to its editor, Greta Reich. “One came in, then two, then five, then 10 – it just really started piling up very quickly,” she said. The requests, she said, ranged from sources seeking anonymity to opinion writers wanting their names removed, and even demands to blur out identifying images. One former staff editor, an international student, quit entirely, according to Reich. “They didn’t want to be associated with any publication or article that could get them in trouble,” she said.\nKinder, too, has had three staff writers resign and four more go on hiatus of fear that their association with certain articles could jeopardize their safety or future career prospects.\nThe growing risk has prompted a coalition of national student journalism organizations to issue an alert on Friday calling on student papers to reconsider longstanding editorial norms around unpublishing stories and anonymization.\n“What we are suggesting today stands in opposition to how many of us as journalism educators have taught and advised our students over the years,” the alert reads. “These are not easy editorial decisions, but these are not normal times.”\nAn ethical dilemma\nTakedown requests present ethical dilemmas familiar to any newsroom, and student papers are no exception, with young editors needing to balance high-stakes safety concerns with the journalistic value of transparency. Some are exploring alternatives to full removals, such as de-indexing controversial articles – removing them from search results while keeping them live on their websites.\nOne editor at an Ivy League university, who requested anonymity given the sensitivities of the issue, said their publication was currently weighing this approach. “It became clear that no solution was going to be perfect. If you delete an article or leave it full of holes, it’s obvious something happened. That could just draw more attention,” they said. They also pointed out that removing articles entirely could backfire, as content often remains accessible through web archives including the Wayback Machine.\nAt the University of Virginia, the Cavalier Daily has historically refused takedown requests, but its editor, Naima Sawaya, acknowledged that the current climate was different. “One of our staffers, an immigrant, had to resign from our editorial board after we published pieces about Trump’s policies on universities, specifically regarding immigrants and pro-Palestine activism,” she said. The student, she said, was advised by the university’s international studies office that being publicly linked to these articles could pose risks to their visa status.\nSawaya has always viewed the paper as an archive. “We try to emphasize to our staffers when we’re onboarding them that the things they write are becoming part of the historical record,” she said. Recent concerns around student safety have started to challenge her view. “If a staffer today asked for a past article to be removed for their safety, I would remove it,” she admitted.\nAt New York University’s Washington Square News, editor Yezen Saadah said that while his publication does not publish anonymous bylines, staff are finding ways to respond to contributors who are at risk. “Some staff members have stepped back from reporting roles due to safety concerns, but they still contribute in [other] editorial capacities,” he said.\nAn editor at a public university in California, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said their newsroom had seen a dramatic increase in anonymization requests since Ice began arresting international students – from opinion writers seeking to remove their names from articles critical of Israel or Trump, to sources seeking to anonymize their quotes. They said international students were now only willing to speak to reporters under condition of anonymity.\n“Most requests come from international students, though domestic students have also expressed concerns,” they said.\nIn February, the Purdue Exponent, a student paper at Purdue University in Indiana, removed the names and images of student protesters advocating for Palestinian human rights from its website, citing safety concerns and the Society of Professional Journalists’ Code of Ethics, which prioritizes minimizing harm. “Pro-Palestinian students are under attack, so we’re removing their names,” the paper announced in an editorial. The paper immediately found itself at the center of a rousing conversation about journalistic ethics, and its editor reportedly received more than 7,000 emails, including death threats.\nMike Hiestand, a lawyer at the Student Press Law Center, said that while student media traditionally resisted takedown requests, the current climate has forced a re-evaluation. “The reluctance to comply with takedown requests was based on a world that existed before January 2025,” Hiestand said.\nLindsie Rank, the campus advocacy director at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, also reiterated how much the risk environment has changed. “If one of these cases had called our hotline six months ago, our response would have been: ‘This isn’t really a legal issue. This is more of an ethical question.’ But that has changed,” she said.\nSawaya, from the Cavalier Daily, hasn’t yet taken down any pieces. But like other editors, she is grappling with how the new political reality is affecting the field she hopes to enter professionally when she graduates.\n“One of the hardest things right now is getting people to talk to us – even people whose job it is to talk to us, like university communications officials,” she said. “It feels like there’s real fear.”"

    "raw_text": "Behind two rows of high fencing and winding coils of razor wire, and surrounded by thick forest in central Louisiana, hundreds of miles from the nearest major city, stands a newly created court the Trump administration hopes will fast-track the removal of undocumented immigrants.\nHearings take place in five poky courtrooms behind reinforced grey doors where the public benches, scratched with graffiti, are completely empty. There is no natural light. The hallways are lined with detainees in yellow jumpsuits awaiting their turn before a judge. The five sitting judges were quietly flown in by the US justice department from cities across the United States and will be rotated again within two weeks.\nThis is the LaSalle detention facility that, since March this year, has been holding removal proceedings for hundreds of detained migrants in courtrooms adjoining a private detention center, which incarcerates more than 1,100 men and women and has the highest number of prisoner deaths of any in America over the past two years.\nThe new setup is part of Donald Trump’s attempts to ramp up deportations by vastly expanding the arrest powers of federal immigration enforcement and prioritising more vulnerable groups of detained migrants in new court locations around the country. It has received little scrutiny since its introduction following a presidential order in January, and the Guardian is the first news organisation to observe proceedings here.\nInside courtroom No 2, during proceedings last Wednesday, Judge Arwen Swink, who usually sits in San Francisco, presided over a crowded morning docket. In an indication of the hastily arranged nature of the setup, the judge’s name was printed out on a piece of paper and stuck to a door behind her, the courtroom also functioning as a makeshift office, complete with a photocopier and in-trays attached to the wall.\nMarcos Ramirez Jr, sat alone before the judge, listening through a headset as a translator interpreted proceedings in Spanish. The court heard how the Guatemalan national had lived in America for almost four decades after crossing the border into the US in 1980. He had been with his wife in Alabama for 15 years and had no criminal history.\nIn April, Ramirez was apprehended by law enforcement for allegedly driving recklessly and without a license. The charges were enough to see him transferred to immigration detention. At a hearing earlier in May, he had been offered a bond of $7,000 but told the court on Wednesday he had no ability to pay it.\n“It has been two weeks since I heard from my wife,” he said, his head cradled in his hands. “She has stage three cancer.” Ramirez had no idea if she was now in hospital or, by extension, whether she was alive or dead.\nAs things stood, without the money to pay for his bond, he would remain in detention until his full hearing, known as a merits hearing, where his chance of being ordered to be deported was much higher than if he had been released on bond and gone to trial at another non-detained court, according to studies of official data.\nThis building is operated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and had never functioned as a court. Before March, the five rooms were used for video conferencing, allowing detainees to appear via video-link in preliminary hearings at an established immigration court (that now technically administers the court at LaSalle) in the small city of Oakdale 90 miles away.\nLawyers and advocates say the new system increases the risk of due-process violations as cases move more rapidly through the system, at a remote venue that already has the lowest rate of legal representation for detainees in the US. The union representing immigration judges, meanwhile, argues that reassigning judges from around the US where courts are already chronically overburdened is simply a waste of resources.\nThe justice department’s executive office for immigration review (EOIR), which administers America’s immigration courts, declined to respond to a list of detailed questions about the new court.\nThe Guardian was also prevented from viewing the LaSalle court’s public docket, which had previously been printed out and displayed outside the courtrooms but removed on the day of the visit. The Guardian was instructed by a court officer, employed by private security firm GEO Group, that court clerks and administrative staff – public employees – would not take any questions for clarification. This meant that basic fact-checking, including the spelling of detainees’ names, could not always be completed.\nDeportation without representation\nIn a number of ways, Ramirez’s story was typical of many of the 43 cases brought before judges that day.\nNumerous hearings observed by the Guardian last Wednesday involved people who had been apprehended by law enforcement after allegedly committing minor traffic offenses. One individual, Osmani Radiya, appearing before Judge Patrick Savage, also on detail from San Francisco, had been arrested after accidentally reversing into a parked van allegedly under the influence. The father of three, two of his children US citizens, had no driver’s license or insurance documents and wound up in detention facing deportation.\nAnother, 21-year-old Diego Garcia, who appeared before Judge Margaret McManus (detailed from New York), had been picked up in Arkansas after driving without a license and providing a false name to police. “I’d like to apologise for what happened, it won’t happen again,” Garcia told the court. Both men were granted bond.\nIn the Trump administration’s first 100 days the number of immigration arrests have soared, with the sharpest increase among those with no criminal record. The LaSalle detention facility, which holds both men and women, serves as a major hub for arrestees from many of the southern states.\nPaul Scott, an immigration attorney who has represented clients detained at LaSalle for nine years, characterised the new system as “taking a large mallet and trying to hit a small nail”.\n“This fast-track system is now being backed up by less dangerous people who actually might have stronger cases [for relief from removal],” he said. “It’s not a very smart or precise plan.”\nWhile the administration may have ramped up arrests, the number of people it has actually been able to deport has remained relatively consistent with the past two years of the Obama administration.\nBut Ramirez’s case was also typical in another manner: he had no lawyer representing him.\nIn US immigration courts, respondents have no right to a public attorney as the proceedings are administrative, not criminal. Those without representation, recent statistical analysis shows, are far more likely to be removed from the US than comparable cases where a lawyer is assigned.\nAccording to data gathered by the Southern Poverty Law Center, only 6% of detained immigrants brought to the Oakdale court between 2007 and 2012 (which during this period heard cases from LaSalle) had attorneys. This marked the joint lowest rate of representation at any immigration court in the US.\nJust a handful of private lawyers like Scott currently serve clients in the LaSalle detention facility and some argue that the creation of the new court, coupled with the recent mothballing of the only pro-bono legal service working with LaSalle detainees, could mean the rate of representation is now lower than it was before.\nScott, who practices in the city of Baton Rouge more than 150 miles away, said in many cases under the new setup, detainees have been brought into proceedings within two days of their arrival at the detention center, making it almost impossible to receive advice from an attorney.\n“Of course, nobody wants to be detained longer than they need to be, but before, in the Oakdale court, they might have had maybe 10 days or so [before a first appearance], which gave their family time to find a lawyer and intervene on their behalf. Now, sometimes, their family members don’t have time to find a lawyer for them because they don’t even know where they are being held.”\nAs a result, Scott said he had more frequently come into contact with potential clients who had already abandoned their case before obtaining legal advice. In many instances the individuals would have been eligible for bond but were deported instead after revoking their rights to fight in court.\nOn Wednesday, a number of detainees in preliminary hearings, known as master calendars, complained to judges they had not been given enough time find a lawyer.\nIn one hearing before Judge Savage, a detainee said he was not even aware if he had an attorney. “I called all the pro-bono ones but couldn’t get through,” he said. Adding: “I am afraid to go back to Mexico.” His merits hearing was then set for 19 June – just 20 days away. He was asked to complete an asylum application, which often take months, in that time.\n‘I’m not sure how things work’\nThere are also structural issues in the LaSalle court that have led to due-process concerns affecting even those who have lawyers.\nPhilip Hunter, a trial attorney from Scott’s firm, was the only defense counsel physically present in the court at any point during the day on Wednesday. Dressed in a sharp navy suit and clutching a file bursting with papers, the 26-year-old visits the facility once a week.\nThe new court, he said, is fraught with technical flaws that make it tougher to act on behalf of clients and to ensure smooth running of the judicial process: broken fax lines make it hard to send and receive documents, teleconferencing systems often fail when a lawyer is patched in remotely, and there are chronic difficulties contacting prosecutors who have no direct phones lines at the new venue.\nIn two cases observed by the Guardian on Wednesday, individuals claimed to have paid their bonds days ago – meaning they should already have been released from detention – but had not had their money accepted into the system.\n“I’m not sure how things work at LaSalle,” Judge Savage conceded as a DHS prosecutor was forced to admit she too did not know what was going on. (Government lawyers, like judges, have also been detailed from other locations.)\nHunter said it appeared that government attorneys were now briefed with fighting cases more aggressively than they ever had been before, contesting bonds, pursuing shorter timeframes between hearings. “They fight everything now,” he said.\nBut perhaps the most fundamental issue is the constant rotation of judges. Cases here are rarely, if ever, heard by the same judge through to conclusion – meaning judges are not well versed in the individuals before them as proceedings begin. The rotating jurists also operate from different case law precedents.\nAs a result, the behaviour of the new court is harder to predict, making preparation more difficult. On some occasions judges flown in from non-detained courts approve bond for clients that Hunter would never have expected. In others, the reverse occurs.\n“It’s a tossup,” said Hunter. “Every time you go to court there’s a new judge. You don’t know what they’re going to do because you’ve never had them before and you don’t know who they are until you turn up in court.”\nEOIR did not respond to questions about any of the due-process concerns or technical issues at LaSalle. The department also declined to answer questions over how many cases had been heard by judges at LaSalle, which other locations judges had been flown in from, and how long the court was due to stay open. But the Guardian understands that the venue will remain open until at least August and that judges from a variety of other cities, including Houston, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Arlington, have been flown into the facility so far.\nDana Leigh Marks, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, shared some of the due-process concerns articulated by lawyers operating at LaSalle, describing the conditions as “extremely challenging” for detailed judges.\nBut the union is also frustrated that judges from courts that are already massively overburdened are being pulled away from their own dockets to serve in LaSalle and other venues where the backlog is tiny in comparison.\nUS Immigration courts are currently experiencing the highest buildup of cases on record. According to statistics published by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse there are almost 600,000 pending cases before immigration judges across the US. The immigration court in New York, where judge McManus was flown from, has over 77,000 pending cases. In San Francisco, where judges Swink, Savage and Dalin Holyoak – another judge detailed to LaSalle on Wednesday – are from, the average wait time is 1,113 days, meaning that some hearings are being scheduled for July 2022. In contrast, the average wait time at LaSalle is now 46 days, substantially less than last year.\nMarks added that the justice department has been less than forthcoming with information about which newly created courts – referred to by the union as “executive order courts” – are still receiving detailed judges.\n“The program has been rolled out in a manner that has not provided a lot of access to information,” she said.\nRecently, the justice department ended judge details at two family detention centres in south Texas, conceding that the dockets were too small to justify their presence. The Guardian has established that four judges are still being rotated to another remote detention facility, the Otero County processing center in New Mexico. The venue had never operated courts before and immigration lawyers there articulated many of the same due-process concerns as those at LaSalle. A newly created court for detainees in Chicago is also holding hearings.\n‘Everyone is getting sick’\nThe LaSalle facility has long been associated with poor standards of care and detainees regularly reported substandard medical attention to researchers at the Southern Poverty Law Center.\nStood in the corridor outside the courtrooms, bathed in intense artificial light, 26 year-old Carlos Vargas dreaded his return to the facility. The Honduran, a client of Hunter’s, was one of those picked up in what he described as a “bullshit traffic stop” in Alabama. He said he was on a wing of the facility with 100 people sharing just three toilets. The food, he said, “is disgusting … everyone is getting sick”.\n“It’s just really stressful. This is my whole life.”\nVargas’s experiences are not uncommon, according Jeremy Jong, an immigration attorney who up until recently worked on the only pro-bono legal program servicing the detention center.\n“Time and time again, you hear from your clients that conditions there are horrible and brutal,” Jong said. “Detention there drives a lot of people crazy, to the point where a lot of people would rather go [back] to a place that they know is dangerous, where they have no family, where they might be tortured.”\nIce spokesman Thomas Byrd said the facility was subject to regular inspections and “has repeatedly been found to operate in compliance with Ice’s rigorous detention standards”. Ice was not able to comment on Vargas’s individual allegations.\nBack in courtroom number two, Judge Swink suggested Marcos Ramirez Jr may be eligible to complete a 42B form, which could cancel the removal proceedings against him if he were able to prove “good moral character”, given he had no prior convictions.\nRamirez, however, felt he was simply unable to carry on pursuing his case. “I just can’t stand being incarcerated anymore,” he told the court in softly spoken Spanish. “Can I please just have my deportation?”\nThere was a moment’s silence as Judge Swink weighed up the options. Ramirez stared towards the floor.\nThe Guatemalan was eventually granted voluntary departure, meaning he would have to leave the US within 20 days but would not have a deportation recorded on his record.\nIt was a small blessing. He stood from the chair, smiled at the judge and was escorted out of the room. The court broke for lunch."

    "raw_text": "Umm Ghadeer’s earliest memories are of the Nakba, or catastrophe, of 1948, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homeland after the creation of Israel. She was three years old. Last month she was forced to abandon her home all over again, fleeing Shejaiya, a neighbourhood of Gaza City, after the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas.\n“I cried very hard because I relived the experience of displacement when we fled our homes in 1948. We fled. Some people were walking on the streets, some in cars, some screaming, some crying. We lost so many people,” she said. “So many awful things happened in 1948. I am now scared of the same thing.”\nWhen Umm Ghadeer was a child, her family lived in Lydda, in Hebrew known as Lod, a small Arab town that was supposed to be part of the new Palestinian state in the UN partition plan that created Israel. In July of that year, however, Israeli forces occupied the town.\nAlmost all of Lydda’s inhabitants were expelled from their homes. About 60,000 people from Lydda and nearby Ramla were forced on to what is known as the death march to Ramallah; up to 170 people who sought shelter in Lydda’s mosque were massacred by Israeli soldiers.\nLike many others, Umm Ghadeer’s family eventually found a new home in the Gaza Strip. Refugees and their descendants from what is now Israel represent 70% of the Palestinian territory’s population of 2.3 million.\nThe retired teacher, now 78, said she cried when she said goodbye to her home in Shejaiya last month as younger family members helped her and her husband to evacuate to the southern half of the strip, after the Israeli military said it would be safer there.\n“Gazans still haven’t had time to rebuild their homes that were destroyed in the first war on Gaza [in 2008]. Half of Shejaiya neighbourhood was levelled and is still not rebuilt, like so many other neighbourhoods,” she said.\nThe Guardian was in touch with Umm Ghadeer two weeks ago and contact has since been lost. At the time, after a perilous journey on roads that were bombed, the family were sheltering in Zawayda, a refugee camp near the central town of Deir al-Balah, at the home of a friend, along with her son, daughter-in-law and five grandchildren, aged between three and 14.\nGaza’s south is still very dangerous: an airstrike near the southern town of Khan Younis killed at least 26 people on Saturday. Food, water, fuel and medicine are in short supply, and Israel has said it is expanding its operations against Hamas to areas south of Gaza City, raising fears for the hundreds of thousands of civilians who have sought refuge there.\nUmm Ghadeer’s health has suffered; she has hypertension, has barely eaten and cries a lot since the family made their way south.\n“I felt that they told us to go south so that they could slowly push us out into Sinai [the desert peninsula controlled by Egypt], set up tents and keep us there. That would be a second Nakba, just like the previous one, and this is it. I cannot digest what’s happening,” she said.\nThe IDF’s relentless air and ground campaign, launched in response to Hamas attacks in Israel that Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people and saw about 240 captured as hostages, has already killed 12,300 people, more than 5,000 of them children, according to the Hamas government.\nMore than half of the strip’s population has been displaced during the six weeks of fighting. Images of dishevelled, distressed families walking south through ruined streets and being searched by soldiers have been powerfully evocative of the Nakba.\nThe Israeli military has repeatedly said civilians will be allowed to return home when the war is over, but it is not clear there will be anything to return to. The assurances also mean little to Palestinians such as Umm Ghadeer who are still dealing with the consequences of what happened in 1948.\nLast week Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right minister in the Israeli government, said Gaza would “not survive as an independent entity” and Palestinians should leave for other countries, driving home fears across the region that Israel seeks to destroy the hope of a Palestinian state altogether.\n“May God help the people who have lost their loved ones,” Umm Ghadeer said. “We pray for justice and hope and if there are any ‘human rights’ that they will be applied to our people.\n“People are now homeless, in the streets. Until when? And what does Israel get out of that?”"

    "raw_text": "Israeli troops opened fire on pro-Palestinian demonstrators attempting to breach its borders on three fronts, killing at least 13 people. Scores more were wounded at Israel's borders with Syria, Lebanon and Gaza.\nClashes also erupted in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as Palestinians commemorated Nakba Day, the anniversary marking the 1948 war in which hundreds of thousands of people became refugees after being forced out of their homes.\nThousands of Palestinian refugees in Syria marched towards the village of Majdal Shams in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. At least four people were killed by Israeli troops as they crossed the border, Israel Radio reported. Up to 20 were injured, according to the Israeli Magen David Adom ambulance service.\nA statement from the Israeli military said: \"Thousands of Syrian civilians breached the Israel-Syria border near the Israeli village of Majdal Shams.\n\"IDF forces opened fire in order to prevent the violent rioters from illegally infiltrating Israeli territory. A number of rioters have infiltrated and are violently rioting in the village. From initial reports there are dozens of injured that are receiving medical care in a nearby hospital.\"\nMost of the inhabitants of Majdal Shams, a large village close to the border, hold Syrian citizenship and have family on the other side of the border, from whom they are cut off. The Israeli army declared the area, which is heavily mined, a closed military zone on Sunday.\nDespite being occupied by Israel for 44 years, the Golan is usually calm. Syria has repeatedly demanded Israel hand back the area.\nA similar Nakba Day protest on the Lebanon border led to four people being killed and around 15 wounded, according to Lebanese media reports. Dozens of protesters approached the border from the Lebanese town of Maroun a-Ras.\nBrigadier General Yoav Mordechai, an Israeli military spokesman, said soldiers fired when demonstrators began vandalising the border fence. The army was \"aware\" of casualties on the other side, he said.\nWitnesses said that Israeli troops had fired across the border at protesters throwing stones from within Lebanon, a move that could have serious repercussions and prompt further cross-border incidents.\nUN peacekeepers on the Lebanese side of the border appealed for \"maximum restraint\" to prevent casualties.\nIn Gaza, around 60 people were injured by shelling and machine-gun fire when protesters approached the heavily fortified Erez border crossing, according to Palestinian medical sources. Israelis living near Gaza were advised to stay inside bomb shelters.\nThe Israeli security forces were braced for wide-scale protests on Nakba Day – the most highly charged day in the Palestinian calendar – and had deployed around 10,000 troops and police along the country's borders and in the Palestinian territories. The West Bank was subject to a 24-hour closure, with only emergency access permitted.\nThe Israeli authorities warned that the first Nakba Day following uprisings across the region could herald riots across the Palestinian territories.\nIn the West Bank, rubber bullets were fired at about 200 Palestinians and supporters who marched towards the Qalandia crossing on the edge of Jerusalem.\nThere was also unrest in East Jerusalem, fuelled by the death of a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who was shot in the stomach during clashes on Friday. He died in hospital on Saturday.\nIn Tel Aviv, an Israeli man was killed and 17 injured when a truck ran into vehicles and pedestrians. It was not clear whether the incident was an accident or a deliberate attack. The truck's 22-year-old Israeli-Arab driver said he lost control of the vehicle due to faulty brakes."

    "raw_text": "Yaba Deen,* it has been two weeks since you were born, and these are my first words to you.\nIn the early hours of 21 April, I waited on the other end of a phone as your mother labored to bring you into this world. I listened to her pained breaths and tried to speak comforting words into her ear over the crackling line. During your first moments, I buried my face in my arms and kept my voice low so that the 70 other men sleeping in this concrete room would not see my cloudy eyes or hear my voice catch. I feel suffocated by my rage and the cruelty of a system that deprived your mother and me of sharing this experience. Why do faceless politicians have the power to strip human beings of their divine moments?\nSince that morning, I have come to recognize the look in the eyes of every father in this detention center. I sit here contemplating the immensity of your birth and wonder how many more firsts will be sacrificed to the whims of the US government, which denied me even the chance of furlough to attend your birth. How is it that the same politicians who preach “family values” are the ones tearing families apart?\nDeen, my heart aches that I could not hold you in my arms and hear your first cry, that I could not unfurl your clenched fists or change your first diaper. I am sorry that I was not there to hold your mother’s hand or to recite the adhan, or call to prayer, in your ear. But my absence is not unique. Like other Palestinian fathers, I was separated from you by racist regimes and distant prisons. In Palestine, this pain is part of daily life. Babies are born every day without their fathers – not because their fathers chose to leave, but because they are taken by war, by bombs, by prison cells and by the cold machinery of occupation. The grief your mother and I feel is but one drop in a sea of sorrow that Palestinian families have drowned in for generations.\nDeen, it was not a gap in the law that made me a political prisoner in Louisiana. It was my firm belief that our people deserve to be free, that their lives are worth more than the televised massacre we are witnessing in Gaza, and that the displacement that began in 1948 and culminated in the current genocide must finally end. This mere belief is what made the state scramble to detain me. No matter where I am when you read this – whether I’m in this country or another – I want to impress upon you one lesson:\nThe struggle for Palestinian liberation is not a burden; it is a duty and an honor we carry with pride. So at every turning point in my life, you will find me choosing Palestine. Palestine over ease. Palestine over comfort. Palestine over self. This struggle is sweeter than a life without dignity. The tyrants want us to submit, to obey, to be perfect victims. But we are free, and we will remain free. I hope you feel this as deeply as I do.\nDeen, as a Palestinian refugee, I inherited a kind of exile that followed me to every border, every airport, every form. Borders mean something to me that they may not mean to you. Each crossing required me to prove my docility, my identity and my very right to exist. You were born an American citizen. You may never feel that weight. You may never have to translate your humanity through paperwork, countless visa applications and interview appointments. I hope you use this not to separate yourself from others, but to uplift those who live under the same circumstances that once constrained me. But I won’t pretend this citizenship protects you. Not completely. Not when you have my name. Not when those in power still see our people as threats.\nOne day, you might ask why people are punished for standing up for Palestine, why truth and compassion feel dangerous to power. These are hard questions, but I hope our story shows you this: the world needs more courage, not less. It needs people who choose justice over convenience.\nIt is nothing but the dehumanization and racist disregard for Palestinians that renders their lives forgettable and that dares describe Palestinian fathers who love their sons as “terrorists”. Perhaps that is why the world so quickly forgot the killing of four-month-old Iman Hijjo in Gaza in 2001. Why did Ahmed Abu Artema’s beloved son Abdullah die hungry for bread? Who recalls the children lost in the Flour Massacre? Where is the justice for the fathers in the West Bank who carefully dress their sons for prison? Why does liberty not visit the bodies of Palestinian children whose limbs are missing, whose ribs are exposed under thin skin and who are born lovingly only to die under an Israeli bomb?\nOn this first Mother’s Day for Noor, I dream of a world where all families are reunited to celebrate the incredible women in their lives. Many years ago, on one of our very first dates, I had asked your mother what she would change in the world if she could. Her simple response was: “I just want people to be nicer to each other.” Deen, you were born to a mother as gentle as she is fierce. I pray that you live in a world shaped by that kindness. I hope, with all my heart, that you will not witness the oppression that I’ve known. I hope that you never need to chant for Palestine, because it has long been free with dignity and prosperity for all. Should that day come, know that it was ushered in through the courage of those who came before you. I am certain that in this new world, you and I will visit Tiberias together, drink from the river and marvel at the sea. There, in a free and just Palestine, you will see the fruits of our struggle.\nDeen, my love for you is deeper than anything I have ever known. Loving you is not separate from the struggle for liberation. It is liberation itself. I fight for you, and for every Palestinian child whose life deserves safety, tenderness and freedom. I hope one day you will stand tall knowing your father was not absent out of apathy, but out of conviction. And I will spend my life making up for the moments we lost – starting with this one, writing to you with all the love in my heart.\n*Yaba Deen: “Yaba” (يابا ) is an affectionate term meaning “dad” in Arabic. In Palestinian Arabic, yaba is often used self-referentially to center the father-son bond in the greeting itself. So when a father says “yaba”, he’s using a tender, fatherly voice to address his child, somewhat like saying: “From your dad, Deen” or “My son, from your yaba (dad)”.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "raw_text": "New York’s police department has declared that approximately 29% of the people it arrested at pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University were “not affiliated” with the institution, as the city’s mayor continues to face scrutiny over his claims that the hardline police response was due to the actions of “outside agitators”.\nThe NYPD also said 60% of arrestees at City College of New York (CCNY) on Tuesday night were unaffiliated with the college, though a CCNY spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian that these arrest figures applied to protesters both on and off the college’s grounds.\nThe statements came as police across the US have arrested almost 2,200 people at campus protests in 43 different locations during a week of heightened tension and unrest that has often been met with tough action from law enforcement.\nOn Friday morning, the NYPD began clearing protest encampments at two other campuses in the city, arresting 13 people at New York University and 43 people at the New School, according to reports. Details of the operations were continuing to emerge, but speaking in the immediate aftermath, the NYPD deputy commissioner Kaz Daughtry continued to claim outside influences had organized the protests.\n“There is somebody funding this. There is somebody radicalizing our students,” the deputy commissioner said, citing as evidence “literature and leaflets” found at both campuses.\nDespite police activity ramping up, protests continued at campuses across the country. Early on Thursday, officers surged against a crowd of demonstrators at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), ultimately taking at least 200 protesters into custody. In North Carolina, hundreds of students at UNC Chapel Hill marched across campus on Friday morning.\nOn Thursday night, police in Portland, Oregon, arrested at least seven people who had occupied the state university’s library. On Long Island in New York a group of protesters gathered at Stony Brook University to show support for the 29 people arrested during protests the previous evening, local news reported.\nThe NYPD release, issued on Thursday evening, stated that 80 of the 112 protesters arrested at Columbia on Tuesday were students. The police department added that 68 of the 170 people arrested at a separate protest at CCNY were also students, meaning 60% were “unaffiliated”.\nBut some observers questioned how the department had determined its definition of “unaffiliated” arrestees, and where some of the arrests took place.\nJournalists covering events at CCNY noted that two strands of protests occurred on Tuesday night, one on campus and another outside of it.\nThe NYPD did not immediately respond to questions over how many of those included in its arrest breakdown were taken into custody outside of college grounds. A spokesperson for CCNY confirmed that the figure related to arrests both outside and inside campus but did not provide a further breakdown.\nOn Thursday evening, Columbia University provided a more detailed breakdown of those arrested inside Hamilton Hall, which had been occupied by protesters earlier in the week – an event cited by the university and the city’s police as a sign of escalation.\nThe university said that of the 44 people arrested inside the building 13 were “non-affiliates” while 14 were undergraduates and nine were graduate students. Two Columbia staff were arrested and six students from affiliated universities.\nA spokesperson for Columbia described “non-affiliates” as “outsiders – not students, not employees”.\nIn the immediate aftermath of Tuesday night’s police crackdown, Adams repeatedly accused “outside agitators” of influencing students. The mayor said occupation of the hall and destruction of property was “the tipping point for me”.\nWhile authorities have lauded the police action at both campuses, the NYPD announced on Thursday evening that an officer had accidentally discharged their firearm during the operation at Hamilton Hall. The bullet did not hit anyone and there were no injuries, the NYPD said, adding that the officer had been holding a firearm with an attached flashlight they had used for “illuminating the area”.\nA review by the Associated Press indicated there had been at least 56 mass arrest incidents on US campuses since 18 April.\nStudents have stepped up their protests, demanding a complete ceasefire in Gaza and divestment by their universities from companies with ties to Israel.\nOn Friday, students at Princeton University in New Jersey announced a hunger strike as part of their Palestinian solidarity encampment, calling for dissociation and divestment from Israel, as well as protecting protesters from punishment.\n“We refuse to be silenced by the university administration’s intimidation and repression tactics. We struggle together in solidarity with the people of Palestine. We commit our bodies to their liberation,” Princeton Divest said in a statement, adding that participants would abstain from all food and drink, except water, until their demands are met by Princeton.\nIsrael has branded the protests across the US antisemitic, while Israel’s critics say it uses those allegations to silence opposition. Although some protesters have been caught on camera making antisemitic remarks or violent threats, protest organizers – some of whom are Jewish – call it a peaceful movement to defend Palestinian rights and protest against the war.\nSome counter-protesters across campuses have also been caught on camera making offensive remarks and violent threats to pro-Palestinian protesters. On Tuesday, counter-protesters launched a violent attack against a pro-Palestine encampment at UCLA, causing 25 people to be hospitalized overnight, according to UC Divest at UCLA.\nJoe Biden on Thursday broke his silence on the protest movement and subsequent unrest. In remarks delivered at the White House, the president defended the right to free speech, but added that “order must prevail”.\n“Dissent is essential for democracy,” Biden said. “But dissent must never lead to disorder.”\nThe president resisted calls from some Republicans to call in the national guard but added that the protests had not made him reconsider his foreign policy agenda in Israel.\n“There’s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos,” Biden added. “People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across campus safely without fear of being attacked.”"

    "raw_text": "A far-right group that claimed credit for the arrest of a Palestinian activist and permanent US resident who the Trump administration is seeking to deport claims it has submitted “thousands of names” for similar treatment.\nBetar US is one of a number of rightwing, pro-Israel groups that are supporting the administration’s efforts to deport international students involved in university pro-Palestinian protests, an effort that escalated this week with the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who recently completed his graduate studies at Columbia University.\nThis week, Donald Trump said Khalil’s arrest was just “the first of many to come”. Betar US quickly claimed credit on social media for providing Khalil’s name to the government.\nBetar, which has been labelled an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish advocacy group, said on Monday that it had “been working on deportations and will continue to do so”, and warned that the effort would extend beyond immigrants. “Expect naturalized citizens to start being picked up within the month,” the group’s post on X read. (It is very difficult to revoke US citizenship, though Trump has indicated an intention to try.)\nThe group has compiled a so-called “deportation list” naming individuals it believes are in the US on visas and have participated in pro-Palestinian protests, claiming these individuals “terrorize America”.\nA Betar spokesperson, Daniel Levy, said in a statement to the Guardian that Betar submitted “thousands of names” of students and faculty they believe to be on visas from institutions like Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Syracuse University and others to representatives of the Trump administration.\nThe group claims to have “documentation, including tapes, social media and more” to support their actions. It claims to be sharing names with several high-ranking officials, including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the White House homeland security adviser, Stephen Miller; and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, among others.\nThe White House and state department did not respond to questions about whether they are working with Betar or other groups to identify students for deportation.\nRoss Glick, who was the executive director of the US chapter of Betar until last month, told the Guardian that the list began forming last fall. He noted that when they started compiling names, it was unclear who the next president would be, but that the change in administrations had been beneficial to their initiative.\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and frequently framed demonstrations against Israel’s actions in Gaza as expressions of support for Hamas. Last week, it was reported that the US state department plans to use AI to identify foreign students for deportation.\nThe arrest of Khalil last week, who served as a lead negotiator for the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University, aligned with Trump’s executive order aimed at combatting antisemitism. An accompanying fact sheet pledged the administration would cancel the student visas of those identified as “Hamas sympathizers” and deport those who participated in “pro-jihadist protests”.\nAfter the election, Glick said he met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including the Democratic senator John Fetterman and aides to the Republican senators Ted Cruz and James Lankford, all of whom, he said, supported the efforts.\nIn a phone call this week, Glick said he discussed Khalil with Cruz in Washington DC just days before he was arrested.\nCruz’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the meeting with Glick.\nGlick said that the individuals on Betar’s list were identified through tips from students, faculty and staff on these campuses, along with social media research. He also claimed he had received support from “collaborators” who use “facial recognition AI-based technology” to help identify protesters that can even identify people wearing face coverings. He declined to elaborate on the specific technology used.\nGlick mentioned that in recent months he had been inundated with messages from students, professors and university administrators across the country, all providing him with information on protesters’ identities. He said that he vetted the legitimacy of those tips and that he believed Khalil and other pro-Palestinian protesters were “promoting the eradication, the destruction and the devolution of western civilization”.\nGlick described Khalil as an “operative”. When asked who he was an operative for, he responded: “Well, that has to be determined.”\nKhalil is being held in a Louisiana detention center after being moved from New York. His detention is being challenged in a Manhattan federal court.\nThe arrest has sparked outrage and alarm from free-speech advocates who see the move to deport Khalil as a flagrant violation of his free speech rights and on Wednesday, protests erupted outside the Manhattan courthouse, where hundreds gathered demanding his freedom.\nBetar is not alone in its efforts to support Trump’s deportation campaign, an effort that has divided American Jews in whose name the administration is purporting to act.\nIn the days leading up to his arrest, videos featuring Khalil and others at a sit-in at Barnard against the expulsion of two students who disrupted a class on Israel began circulating on social media.\nPro-Israel social-media accounts, including that of Shai Davidai, a vocal assistant professor at Columbia’s business school who was temporarily barred from campus last year after the school said he repeatedly intimidated and harassed university employees, identified Khalil and tagged Rubio in posts urging him to revoke his visa and deport him.\nThe video of Khalil that was circulating was first posted by Canary Mission, an online database that publishes the names and personal information of people that it considers to be anti-Israel or antisemitic, focusing mainly on those at universities across the US.\nWhen Khalil was arrested, Canary Mission said that it was “delighted that our exposure of Mahmoud Khalil’s hatred has led to such deserved consequences”, adding that it had “more Columbia news on its way”.\nOn Monday afternoon, Canary Mission released a video naming five other students and faculty it believes should be deported.\nIt was revealed this week by Zeteo that Khalil had emailed Columbia University the day before his arrest, appealing for protection and telling the university’s interim president that he was being subjected to a “dehumanizing doxxing campaign” that week led by Davidai and David Lederer, a Columbia student.\n“Their attacks have incited a wave of hate, including calls for my deportation and death threats,” Khalil said.\nHe added: “I haven’t been able to sleep, fearing that Ice or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support, and I urge you to intervene and provide the necessary protections to prevent further harm.”\nIn another email, Khalil reportedly cited a threatening post by Betar, in which the group claimed he said: “Zionists don’t deserve to live.” Khalil “unequivocally” denied ever saying that.\nIn that post, Betar wrote that Ice was “aware of his home address and whereabouts” and said it had “provided all his information to multiple contacts”.\nAfter the arrest, Karoline Leavitt, the spokesperson for the White House, said that Columbia University had been given the “names of other individuals who have engaged in pro-Hamas activity” but said that the school was “refusing to help DHS identify those individuals on campus”.\n‘A moment of reckoning’\nKhalil’s arrest has divided American Jews, many of whom have harshly condemned the activist’s arrest.\nThe ADL, a group that describes its focus as fighting antisemitism and all forms of hate and that is also known to view campus protests as antisemitic, welcomed the escalation and said it appreciated “the Trump administration’s broad, bold set of efforts to counter campus antisemitism.\n“Obviously, any deportation action or revocation of a Green Card or visa must be undertaken in alignment with required due process protections,” the group said. It added: “We also hope that this action serves as a deterrent to others who might consider breaking the law on college campuses or anywhere.”\nBut many mainstream, progressive and leftwing Jewish groups have condemned the administration’s actions as a dangerous violation of free speech.\n“It is both possible and necessary to directly confront and address the crisis of antisemitism, on campus and across our communities, without abandoning the fundamental democratic values that have allowed Jews, and so many others, to thrive here,” said Amy Spitalnick, head of the liberal Jewish Council for Public Affairs.\nIn a letter on Thursday to the US Department of Homeland Security, several groups including the New York Jewish Agenda, Aleph: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, Habonim Dror North America and others, said that they were “deeply disturbed by the circumstances surrounding the apprehension and detention of Mahmoud Khalil”.\n“Irrespective of the content of Mr Khalil’s speech, we firmly believe that his arrest does nothing to make Jews safer,” the groups said. “In the past, laws and policies that limit the right to free speech have often been wielded against the Jewish community, and we are worried that we are seeing signs that they are being wielded against Muslim, Arab, and other minority communities now.”\nDavid Myers, a distinguished professor and the Sady and Ludwig Kahn chair in Jewish history at the University of California Los Angeles, told the Guardian he believed the Trump administration was instrumentalizing and weaponizing “antisemitism for political gain”.\n“I think ultimately, [the administration] is interested in something larger than defending Jewish students, it’s really interested in bringing the university to its knees as a way of removing a key liberal, progressive actor from the American political game,” he said.\nMyers described Betar’s decision to compile a list of people to be deported as “horrifying” but “not a total surprise”, he said, given what Betar has historically represented, which he called an “embrace of Jewish fascism”.\n“I find it distasteful, un-Jewish and collaborationist to forge together lists of people who fail to meet a political litmus test,” Myers said.\nHe believes universities should resist pressure from the government and uphold the principles of fairness and democracy.\n“It’s a moment of reckoning about where one’s values really lie,” he said.\n“If universities submit, that’s removing an extraordinarily important site of free and open thinking from the American political conversation. I think that would be very ominous for this country, a further step in the move towards a fully authoritarian regime.”"

    "raw_text": "Columbia University has yielded to a series of changes demanded by the Trump administration as a pre-condition for restoring $400m in federal funding the government pulled this month amid allegations that the school tolerated antisemitism on campus.\nThe university released a memo outlining its agreement with Donald Trump’s administration hours before an extended deadline set by the government was to expire.\nColumbia acquiesced to most of the administration’s demands in a memo that laid out measures including banning face masks on campus, empowering security officers to remove or arrest individuals, and taking control of the department that offers courses on the Middle East from its faculty.\nThe Ivy League university’s response is being watched by other universities that the Trump administration has sanctioned as it advances its policy objectives in areas ranging from campus protests to transgender sports and diversity initiatives.\nThe Trump administration has warned at least 60 other universities of possible action over alleged failure to comply with federal civil rights laws related to antisemitism. It has also targeted at least three law firms that the president says helped his political opponents or helped prosecute him unfairly.\nAmong the most contentious of the nine demands, Columbia agreed to place its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department under a new official, the memo said, taking control away from its faculty.\n“In this role, the Senior Vice Provost will review the educational programs to ensure the educational offerings are comprehensive and balanced,” the memo read, explaining that the review would start with the Center for Palestine Studies; the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies; the Middle East Institute; and other university programs focused on the Middle East.\nThe new official would also be in control of the review process for hiring the university’s non-tenured staff and for approving curricular changes.\nProfessor Jonathan Zimmerman, an education historian at the University of Pennsylvania and a “proud” graduate of Columbia, called it a sad day for the university.\n“Historically, there is no precedent for this,” Zimmerman said. “The government is using the money as a cudgel to micromanage a university.”\nZimmerman said the White House actions had apparently already had a chilling effect on higher education because officials at other universities failed to band together and speak out.\nThe White House had yet to respond to Columbia’s memo as of Friday evening, and the status of the funding remained unclear.\nThe sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month had already been disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.\nScientists and doctors who had been awarded grants by the National Institutes of Health after months or years of work described receiving unusual notices by email last week saying their projects had been terminated because of “unsafe antisemitic actions”.\nCanceled projects included the development of an AI-based tool to help nurses detect the deterioration of a patient’s health in hospital two days earlier than other early warning systems.\nThe administration also canceled funding for a study designed to improve the safety of blood-transfusion therapies for adults, children and newborns, and research on uterine fibroids, which are non-cancerous tumors that can cause pain and affect women’s fertility.\nThe demand had raised alarm among professors at Columbia and elsewhere, who worried that permitting the federal government to dictate how a department is run would set a dangerous precedent.\nRepublican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in the department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nThe school has also hired three dozen special officers who have the power to arrest people on campus and has revised its anti-discrimination policies, including its authority to sanction campus organizations, the memo said.\nFace masks to conceal identities are no longer allowed, and any protesters must now identify themselves when asked, the memo said.\nThe school also said it is searching for new faculty members to “ensure intellectual diversity”. Columbia plans to fill joint positions in the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies and the international affairs school in an effort to ensure “excellence and fairness in Middle East studies”, the memo said. The sudden shutdown of millions of dollars in federal funding to Columbia University this month was already disrupting medical and scientific research at the school, researchers said.\nColumbia has come under particular scrutiny, following the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled its campus last year, when its lawns filled with tent encampments and noisy rallies against the US government’s support of Israel.\nRepublican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives last year criticized at least two professors of Palestinian descent working in Columbia’s Middle Eastern studies department for their comments about the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza."

    "raw_text": "Mahmoud Khalil squinted in the afternoon sun as he walked away from the fences topped with razor wire, through two tall gates and out into the thick humidity of central Louisiana.\nAfter more than three months detained in this remote and notorious immigration detention center in the small town of Jena, he described a bittersweet feeling of release, walking towards a handful of journalists with a raised fist, visibly relieved, but composed and softly spoken.\n“Although justice prevailed, it’s very long overdue and this shouldn’t have taken three months,” he said, after a federal judge in New Jersey compelled the Trump administration to let him leave detention as his immigration case proceeds.\n“I leave some incredible men behind me, over one thousand people behind me, in a place where they shouldn’t have been,” he said. “I hope the next time I will be in Jena is to actually visit.”\nFlanked by two lawyers, and speaking at a roadside framed by the detention center in the backdrop, he told the Guardian how his 104 days in detention had changed him and his politics.\n“The moment you enter this facility, your rights leave you behind,” he said.\nHe pointed to the sprawling facility now behind him.\n“Once you enter there, you see a different reality,” he said. “Just a different reality about this country that supposedly champions human rights and liberty and justice. Once you cross, literally that door, you see the opposite side of what happens on this country.”\nKhalil is the most high profile of the students arrested and detained by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestinian activism. He was the final one left in detention, following an arrest that saw him snatched from his Columbia apartment building in New York.\nThe Trump administration has labelled Khalil a national security threat and invoked rarely used powers of the secretary of state under immigration law to seek his removal. The administration has fought vigorously to keep Khalil detained and continues to push for his removal from the US.\nAsked by the Guardian what his response to these allegations were, Khalil replied: “Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this. That doesn’t mean there is a right person for this. There is no right person who should be detained for actually protesting a genocide.”\nHe spoke briefly of his excitement of seeing his newborn son for the first time away from the supervision of the Department of Homeland security. The baby was born while Khalil was held in detention. He looked forward to their first hug in private. He looked forward to seeing his wife, who had been present at the time of his arrest.\nHe smiled briefly.\nAnd then he turned back towards a car, ready to take him on the first leg of a journey back home."

    "raw_text": "If the Nuremberg trials were political theatre, writer and director James Vanderbilt leans into the spectacle of it. His new movie Nuremberg, about the show put on for the rest of the world to indict Nazi war criminals, is packaged like old-fashioned entertainment. There are movie stars (chiefly Rami Malek and Russell Crowe) with slicked-back hair, trading snappy barbs and self-important monologues in smoky rooms, meanwhile the gravity of the moment tends to be kept at bay. All the bureaucratic and legal speak around fine-tuning an unprecedented process, where one country prosecutes the high command of another, goes down easy in an Aaron Sorkin sort of way. It is riveting when its urgency is defended by an actor as great as Michael Shannon. It is all so watchable, to a fault, especially when dealing with the unspeakable.\nThere’s some rhyme and reason to the director’s approach. Vanderbilt (who wrote the screenplay for David Fincher’s Zodiac, a masterpiece about the impossible pursuit for truth) has made a movie about two figures so narcissistic, opportunistic and caught up in the showmanship that they leave very little room for the gravity of the moment to sink in.\nMalek plays Douglas M Kelley, the psychiatrist tasked with monitoring the indicted prisoners’ mental health, just to make sure they don’t kill themselves before they stand trial. We meet him confidently flirting with a woman on a train, playing card tricks to show off his ability to read and misdirect his opponents.\nCrowe, often shot to fill the frame, plays Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe deemed the second most powerful man in Germany. He’s introduced in an opening that quickly goes from clever to flippant, where onscreen text announces that Adolf Hitler is dead and 70 million have perished in the war. In one take we watch as migrants move on foot through an Austrian wasteland (a road to where would be the question) and a soldier relieves himself on the swastika painted on a bombed-out Nazi vehicle.\nIn comes Crowe’s Göring, chauffeured in a limousine, surrendering to the allied forces by commanding they take his luggage. Crowe is one of the few people onscreen who can manage the comic relief without undercutting the weight of his character, whatever humour or witticisms Göring dishes out laced with calculated malevolence.\nMuch of Nuremberg hangs on the scenery chewing between Kelley and Göring during casual therapy sessions, where both seem to bond over their shared affinity for gamesmanship, while ultimately pursuing their own claim to infamy. Göring is gearing up for a trial where he can reinforce the Nazi ideals he still stands by, and go down as a martyr if he must, while taking no responsibility for the Holocaust. Kelley can’t wait to write a book on what goes on in the minds of Nazis.\nSpoiler alert: the fruit of Kelley’s labour is called 22 Cells in Nuremberg. In his review of the 1947 book’s assessments – about how Nazi psychology could not only influence those abroad but was in part fostered by the west – Fredric Wertham writes “there is little in America today which could prevent the establishment of a Nazi-like state.” Vanderbilt’s Nuremberg hammers down on that argument, and its relevance today, with Crowe’s Göring echoing a familiar slogan when he says Hitler “made us feel German again”.\nThe point Vanderbilt perhaps unintentionally skirts, is how ultimately hollow the spectacle at Nuremberg can feel; not just in his movie, but since prosecuting war crimes and establishing international law has done nothing to prevent the atrocities in Gaza. That sort of realness never cracks through the polished surfaces in Vanderbilt’s Nuremberg, which is too often seduced by the spectacle it should be more critical of.\nThe movie reduces Kelley’s psychiatric insights into soundbites, manages to whittle down the proceedings at the Nuremberg trials into the familiar tropes and cliches from classic courtroom movies, and even lets Crowe’s performance surrender its nuances to hammy villainy, all for the sake of reliable entertainment.\nA pivotal point in Nuremberg arrives during the trial, when prosecutors show shocking and horrifying footage filled with emaciated, mutilated and decaying bodies at concentration camps. Vanderbilt opts to show the real footage. But instead of ushering in the gravity this movie keeps at a distance for so long, the authentic material only highlights how artificial everything surrounding it really is.\n-\nNuremberg is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released 7 November in the US and 14 November in the UK"

    "raw_text": "It was easy to understand why Edward Berger’s name was being bandied around in relation to the reinvention of 007, the director having shown himself to be more than capable of both extravagantly staged action (his Oscar-winning breakout All Quiet on the Western Front) and knife-edge intrigue (his Oscar-winning follow-up Conclave). He dismissed speculation at the time (with some mild annoyance) and the job has since landed at the feet of Denis Villeneuve – but his latest, China-set gambling drama Ballad of a Small Player, adds flashy bombast to his résumé and helps to explain why even though he might have passed on Bond (and recently Ocean’s too), he’s in development on a Bourne.\nBerger is a canny commercial director, confidently switching between genre, language and location, the kind of able film-maker studios are desperate to entrust a franchise with, but I hope he’s sparing with the time he chooses to spend under the studio thumb. Ballad of a Small Player, an operatic adaptation of the Lawrence Osborne novel, is not quite him at his best – it is far more bark than bite – but it’s made with such force and finesse and is so distinctively separate from his other films that I look forward to seeing what other non-sequel journeys he chooses to take us on in the future.\nHe’s headed straight from Rome to Macau, the Vegas of China, complete with fake skies, shoddier versions of global landmarks and a deck of gamblers whose shamelessly indulgent nights turn into existentially regretful days. One of them is Lord Doyle (Colin Farrell), a pretentious longtime guest of a hotel he’s struggling to afford. His performed posh accent and fake Savile Row gloves mask a working-class Irish pretender, whose luck at the Baccarat table has started to fade. His unpaid bills are mounting up and then there’s the small problem of a new hotel guest who might just know who he really is.\nThat guest is played by Tilda Swinton, who had another small role in a stylish Netflix character study about a man with a specific skillset, David Fincher’s The Killer. In that film she was such a knockout that in one excellent extended scene, she managed to steal the entire movie, but here she’s a strange distraction, looking more like a character from a Roald Dahl novel (and in her final scene, like someone from The Hunger Games universe). It’s too much of a dress-up bit and her performance, and absurd styling, is a reflection of Berger’s tendency to crank too much of his film up to an 11 with a thumpingly dramatic score from Volker Bertelmann and an uncomfortably dialled-up sound design. At times the latter is horribly necessary, during some particularly unpleasant food binges, but too often, it renders us numb.\nIt is to Farrell’s great credit that he avoids following Berger all the way to the top and over, a role that would have forced a lesser actor into deafening histrionics (one can only wince at the thought of Nicolas Cage here) but one that he embodies with more thought and careful modulation. His character is an addict who cannot stop consuming, terrified by the fear that he might never be full. Farrell’s jittery unease – as he goes for one more game, has one more drink, eats one more slice – is made difficult to watch, but it sears less because of the cranked-up nature of Berger’s direction and more because of the actor’s haunted drive. What if there’s nothing out there to fill me up? Outside of his vices, he also hopes that a casino hostess, played with empathy by Fala Chen, might help.\nWhere the film takes that particular, rather cliched dynamic is hard to understand before it becomes hard to stomach, a last-act reveal that we’ve seen too many times before. We’ve seen less of Macau though, at least in western cinema (Bond made a brief stop in Skyfall), and Berger shows its neon-drowned excess as successfully seductive before it becomes repellent, like so much of the film. The grim spectre of suicide brings a large shadow over the film, spoken about frankly by those who have found themselves in places without many options, and in the film’s hardest moments, Berger is able to capture just how awfully the overwhelm of addiction can make it all seem entirely hopeless. He is too often distracted though by the overwhelm of technique, and Ballad of a Small Player ends up a little too slight, a sketchy look at a familiarly doomed character (a third Oscar film in a row seems unlikely). Farrell is the real winner here.\n-\nBallad of a Small Player is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in cinemas on 15 October and on Netflix on 29 October"

Put simply, they make robot masseuses: cushioned tables with two large, white, robotic arms that rub your body based on your preferences and preselected programs.\nI love massages – I am never happier than when the profane flesh sack I call my body is being kneaded like Wagyu beef. So I opt for a 30-minute “Power Up”, which costs $60 and promises to leave me feeling “invigorated and alert”.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic Health System, massage therapy can help with a number of conditions including anxiety, depression, sports injuries, digestive disorders, headaches and soft tissue sprains. It can also improve circulation, strengthen the body’s immune response, lower stress levels and increase energy.\nBut is a massage from a machine as good as a massage from a person?\n“There are so many contraptions out there. My mom has a massage chair and I use a Theragun at home,” says Crista de la Garza, a board-certified massage therapist in Colorado. While there can be value in these tools, De la Garza says she is not worried about a robot coming for her job.\nFirst, there are real physical benefits to being touched by a person. During the early pandemic, for example, when people were isolating and social distancing, many reported feeling “skin hunger” – a sense of deprivation and abandonment that comes from not getting enough physical touch.\nA 2024 paper in the journal Nature said that receiving touch was “of critical importance” and found that touch interventions helped reduce pain and feelings of depression and anxiety in adults. The paper also found that touch interventions from objects or robots “resulted in similar physical benefits, but lower mental health benefits”.\n“It is a powerful thing to be touched safely and appropriately and therapeutically,” says De la Garza.\nIn fairness, Aescape’s website says it “is not about replacing therapists”. Instead, “it’s about enhancing their work and addressing the industry’s labor shortage.”\n“Nothing can replace a human,” the efficient, blond receptionist tells me when I arrive for my appointment. I’m late because of parking woes, but the machine doesn’t care. It’s a regular spa, with manicures, pedicures, human massages and crystals for sale at the front desk. On our way to the robot’s chamber, she says the Aescape has been popular, especially with clients who “aren’t comfortable being touched by a stranger”, she says.\nInside, she hands me a high-compression, Aescape-branded top and leggings to wear during my treatment. Apparently, they help enhance the machine’s “body detection”. I lie down on the table and hold very still while the Aescape scans my body. She shows me the screen controls and an emergency button that I can press if anything goes wrong.\n“We haven’t needed that!” she says brightly before leaving me to change.\nOnce I’m prone and facing the screen, I’m confronted with an array of choices. What kind of music would I like to listen to? Lo-fi ambient jazz, classic rock or a playlist called “brat”? I can view an unsettlingly detailed outline of my body – they didn’t need to depict my saddle bags so clearly – or soothing videos of the ocean, a snowy mountain or a rainy forest. I can adjust the height of my headrest and change the pressure of the machine.\nOne of the things that makes De la Garza skeptical about robot massage is that it “makes you think too much”. Getting massaged by a person involves more surrender – the therapist controls most of the experience, she says, and the client can turn off their brain: “The client’s job is to breathe, communicate as needed, and simply be in a relaxed state.”\nIndeed, I find myself distracted by the urge to tweak the music and scenery. Do I like looking at snow? It’s OK. Can I relax to the “brat” playlist? No – back to ambient lo-fi. Is that really what my butt looks like? Chilling.\nSome friends said a machine massage would make them nervous. What if the powerful robotic arms skewered my soft flesh like a pile of antipasti? I, on the other hand, was more worried it wouldn’t be strong enough, and that my knots of tension would remain coiled and tight.\nBut the massage is enjoyable. The robot’s blunt, plastic hands are gently warmed. They can’t knead and poke as precisely as human fingertips, but their ministrations feel pleasant. Actually, the hands are more like knobs, roughly the size and shape of small Dutch clogs. It feels a little like someone pressing their fist into your back.\nAt the end of my session, I feel looser and more relaxed than I had at the beginning. I don’t feel invigorated, exactly, but I do think I could drop into a deep, dreamless sleep.\nIt is certainly no substitute for a real massage. I like the surrender and precision of a normal massage, and the Aescape can’t massage the head, hands or feet. But if I can see myself going again if I feel particularly sore after a workout, or if I find myself roaming around a suburban shopping center with 30 minutes to kill. It’s relatively cheap, and you don’t have to tip."

    "raw_text": "“Lymphatic drainage massage” doesn’t sound sexy; the term brings to mind those videos of mud oozing from underground drain pipes. But it seems to be everywhere. Stars like Selena Gomez, Jennifer Aniston and Sean “Diddy” Combs get it done. One popular Los Angeles masseuse who specializes in lymphatic drainage reportedly has a waitlist of over 2,300.\nFor years, lymphatic drainage massage has been used to treat conditions like lymphedema and post-surgical swelling. Athletes have used it to speed up their recovery process. So how did it become the massage therapy du jour? What does it really do? And why, when I tried it, did the massage therapist repeatedly urge me to “stay near a toilet” for the rest of the day?\nWhat is lymphatic drainage massage?\nTo understand lymphatic drainage, one must first understand the lymphatic system.\n“You can think of the lymphatic system as basically a mass highway throughout your body for fluid balance,” says Dr Brendon Ross, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation medicine at the University of Chicago. The complex network of organs, vessels and tissues helps send immune cells to where they’re needed, and flushes out toxins that accumulate due to injury or as a byproduct of the metabolic process.\nGentle massage techniques can help move the lymphatic fluid, strengthening the immune system and helping the body heal faster.\nThe key word in all of this, notes Sierra Velasquez, a certified massage therapist and certified manual lymph drainage therapist, is “gentle”. Velasquez says she has recently seen lymphatic drainage massage used on social media to describe deep tissue massages, which do nothing for the lymphatic system.\n“The massage is very gentle,” she says. “The pressure is like the weight of a nickel. It’s an incredibly light touch.”\nThis is important because many of the lymph vessels are right beneath the skin, she says. “If you’re pressing down on the vessels, that’s actually going to stagnate them,” says Velasquez. The right technique is to lightly brush the lymph vessels – usually towards the lymph nodes, tiny organs that help filter lymphatic fluid. Lymph nodes exist throughout the body, but some of the biggest clusters are in the neck, armpits, groin and knees.\nWhile terms like lymphatic drainage massage, lymphatic massage and manual lymphatic drainage are often used interchangeably online, they don’t necessarily always mean the same thing, Velasquez says. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a “systematic approach to lymph drainage”, she explains. This can be a standalone treatment, or incorporated into standard massage therapy.\nFor those looking for a full MLD treatment, she suggests working with a certified manual lymphatic drainage therapist (CMLDT).\n“I’ve come across a lot of professionals who think lymphatic just means light pressure,” she says. “There’s a lot more education to it than that.”\nWhat are the benefits of lymphatic drainage massage?\nLymphatic drainage massage has long been used to help with lymphedema, a condition in which the lymphatic system is damaged and fluid accumulates in the body’s soft tissues, typically around one’s arms or legs. Velasquez adds that it is also recognized to effectively treat post-surgical swelling, migraines and fibromyalgia.\nVelasquez, who has worked in massage therapy for two decades, says that she saw a dramatic uptick in interest in lymphatic drainage massage after the pandemic began. “Mostly due, I think, to the rise in plastic surgery,” she says. The technique can help people recover more quickly from procedures like breast augmentations and Brazilian butt lifts, she explains.\nThe technique has also been popular in athletic circles. Ross, who is also a team physician for the WNBA’s Chicago Sky, says the technique helps reduce the swelling and inflammation that can occur at the site of an injury, and helps promote “a more rapid and healthier healing response”.\nHe adds that the massage can also help with the upper respiratory infections that tend to crop up during times of travel.\nRoss says that the decongesting effects of lymphatic drainage can kick in after minutes or hours, while a reduction in inflammation caused by injuries could take 24 to 48 hours; the length of time may vary, depending on factors like the person’s health and the condition being treated.\nCan lymphatic drainage lead to weight loss?\nLymphatic drainage can be a powerful tool. But Velasquez says there’s a lot of misinformation about it online, especially when it comes to losing weight.\n“Some people are getting the impression that it can shrink fat cells, and that’s not what’s happening,” she says. Photos on social media show people looking noticeably smaller after their treatments. Setting aside the strong possibility of careful posing and photo editing magic, Velasquez says that any difference in appearance after a massage is not the result of any change in the body composition, but of the body processing fluids faster and getting rid of excess water via urination.\n“A dramatically different feeling or look” after lymphatic drainage massage “would be very rare,” she says.\nIs there anyone who shouldn’t do lymphatic massage?\nBecause lymphatic massages are so gentle, Ross and Velasquez say they are suitable for the vast majority of people. Ross advises caution and adjustments in technique if one is working with a more localized infection, like an abscess, to avoid further aggravation.\nWhat does lymphatic massage feel like?\nWhen I went for my first lymphatic massage, the massage therapist who treated me emphasized that this was not a regular massage. “This is not for your muscles,” she said. “It’s much lighter. Superficial.”\nI said I understood, and she smiled. “Luckily, we are in a room right near the toilet!”\nDespite this ominous warning, I was able to relax and enjoy my massage, which was pleasant. The therapist used long, light strokes to brush my skin towards the lymph nodes at my knees, groin, armpits and neck. The whole process made me feel like a pampered toothpaste tube, and I didn’t once have to race to the restroom.\nAfterwards, she mentioned again that I should stay near a toilet for the rest of the day. I walked home feeling nervous. What had I wrought upon my body and possibly my building’s plumbing system?\nI posed this question to Ross, who was as polite as one can be when someone asks them if they’re moments away from having a bathroom emergency.\n“Because we are working on fluid balance, and because you are washing out, or trying to detoxify the body with these massages, you can have increased urination,” he says. He then assures me: “I haven’t found any significant gastrointestinal distress.”\nIn the interest of transparency, I peed a regular amount during the day, and overall felt fine.\nBOTTOM LINE\nHow much did it cost? $135 plus tip.\nDid it work? I wasn’t injured or congested at the time, so I can’t speak to its healing properties.\nWould I do it again? Yes. After years of asking massage therapists to grind me into dust, it turns out I love a light massage!\nDid it fix me? No, but I didn’t really need it at the time; I’d be open to trying it again when I have some sort of light injury or strain.\nOverall rating: Three out of five trips to the bathroom."

    "raw_text": "When was the last time you touched someone you don’t live with? One day last March, probably; you’re not sure of the date. Did you shake hands with a new colleague at work? Did your coat brush against another commuter’s on the train? Did someone bump your elbow and mutter an apology when rushing past you on an escalator? If you’d known that was the last time you’d make contact with the body of a stranger, you’d have paid more attention.\nAnd what about the 8.2 million British adults who live on their own? Many will have gone nearly a year now without so much as a pat on the arm from another person. Touch is the sense we take most for granted, but we miss it when it’s gone. Psychologists have a term for the feelings of deprivation and abandonment we experience: “skin hunger”.\nSkin hunger is not a phrase I had come across before last year, nor a problem I ever imagined facing. I am a socially awkward, non-tactile person. I have looked on nervously as, over the past two decades, hugging has moved from being a marginal pursuit to a constant of British social life. A hug feels to me like an odd mix of the natural and the artful. It is natural because bodily contact is the first, endorphin-releasing language we learn as babies and share with other apes. But it is also artful, because it has to be silently synchronised with someone else, unlike a handshake which can be offered and accepted asynchronously.\nFor the truly socially inept, even a handshake can be fiddly. I used to botch them all the time, offering the wrong hand (being left-handed didn’t help) or grabbing the other person’s fingers instead of their palm. Then, just as I had completed my long internship in handshaking, it began to lose currency and I had to hastily reskill in hugging.\nThe best I could manage at first was a sort of bear-claw hold with my arms hanging limply down my huggee’s back. It must have been like trying to cuddle a scarecrow. I got better at it; I had to. Now I find that I really miss hugging people. I even miss those clumsy, mistimed hugs where you bang bones together and it goes on just slightly too long or not long enough. And “hunger” feels like the right word for it, in the sense that your body lets your mind know that something is up, and fills it with a gnawing sense of absence.\nAristotle considered touch the lowliest sense. He looked down on it because it was found in all animals and it relied on mere proximity, not the higher human faculties of thought, memory and imagination. But one could just as easily say that touch is the highest sense and for the same reasons. It is the basic animal instinct that lets us know we are alive in the world. It offers proof of the solidity of things other than ourselves.\nTouch is our first sensation. The hand of a two-month-old human foetus will grasp when it feels something in its palm. A new-born baby will instinctively turn its head towards a touch on the cheek. All over the world, children play tag without having to learn how. The earliest forms of medicine drew on this human need to touch and be touched. The practice of healing massage emerged in India, China and southeast Asia by the third millennium BCE, before spreading west. Asclepius, the Greek god of healing, cured people by touching them. The word surgeon originally meant hand healer, from the Greek for hand (kheir) and work (ergon). In the gospels, Jesus cures the sick with the laying on of hands.\nIn recent years the caring professions have revived this practice of healing through touch. The tender touch of others is now known to boost the immune system, lower blood pressure, decrease the level of stress hormones such as cortisol and trigger the release of the same kind of opiates as painkilling drugs. Premature babies gain weight when rubbed lightly from head to foot. Massages reduce pain in pregnant women. People with dementia who are hugged and stroked are less prone to irritability and depression.\nOur oldest myths speak of the life-giving power of touch. In Homer’s Odyssey, Odysseus, visiting Hades, tries to hug his dead mother, Anticleia, so that they might “find a frigid comfort in shared tears”. But Anticleia is now a lifeless husk; she just slips through his arms like a hologram. Homer’s metaphor for the unbridgeable chasm between the living and the dead – a failed hug – feels newly resonant in the time of Covid. The Homeric underworld is a place of permanent lockdown, where the dead live on as unreachable, self-isolating ghosts.\nPhilip Pullman’s His Dark Materials trilogy echoes this scene in its last book, The Amber Spyglass. Lyra tries to hug her friend Roger in the world of the dead, but he passes “like cold smoke through her arms”. Pullman’s trilogy is a hymn to the materiality of the human body. It deliberately inverts the traditional Christian story, in which our eternal souls triumph over our flawed, sinful flesh. Pullman’s angels long to have bodies like humans, to feel the world through the senses. His human characters have “dæmons”, physical manifestations of their souls, which means that they can hold themselves in their arms, the way Lyra hugs her dæmon, Pan.\nIt is hard to read His Dark Materials now without thinking about how the pandemic has separated us from each other. The different worlds in Pullman’s work are divided by the thinnest of membranes. The strange new rituals of the past year have all been about trying to reach across such thin but absolute divides. Older couples stand in front gardens, waving at their grandchildren through windows and miming hugs. People embrace their relatives in care homes through “cuddle curtains”: plastic sheets with two pairs of sleeves, allowing them to hug without touching. In Zoom meetings, we smile and wave at the shapeshifting pixels on our screens because they resemble people we used to know and perhaps once touched.\nThe virus, by forcing us apart, reminds us of this inescapable fact: we live in our bodies. Maybe we had begun to forget this in a world that links us up in so many virtual, intangible ways. That miraculous piece of technology, the touchscreen, works through a desensitised, near-touchless touch. It smoothly responds to our prodding, pinching and swiping so that we may do our duty as good little online citizens, working, shopping and distracting ourselves endlessly. But as our fingers and thumbs glide across the uniform surface, there is no sensuality or responsiveness in the touch. For the skin-hungry, this is thin gruel.\nTouch is a universal language, but every culture has its own way of speaking it. In north Africa and the Middle East, men join their hands together in greeting, then kiss their own hands or hold them to the heart. The Congolese touch each other on the temples and kiss foreheads. In Tuvalu they sniff each other’s cheeks. Andaman islanders in the Bay of Bengal sit in each other’s laps and then, in farewell, lift the other person’s hand to their mouth and blow.\nBritain, by contrast, has historically been a low-contact culture. One explanation for the rise of ballroom dancing in this country is that it gave shy strangers formal permission to hold each other. Studying the etiquette in a Bolton dance hall in 1938, the anthropologist Tom Harrisson noted that a man would ask a woman for a dance simply by touching her elbow and waiting for her to fall into his arms. This couple might dance the whole night without speaking, then go their separate ways.\nIn touch-deprived cultures, touching is no less important than in tactile ones. As we have learned over the past year, when people are starved of touch the slightest forms of contact become filled with meaning. The most charged moment in Brief Encounter (1945) comes when Laura (played by Celia Johnson) and Alec (Trevor Howard) can’t say goodbye properly, because an annoying acquaintance of Laura’s has gatecrashed their final farewell. So he softly squeezes her shoulder, a small gesture filled with doomed longing.\nA hesitant embrace can speak as potently as an ardent one. On 30 May 1953 Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay arrived back at advance base camp after climbing Everest. According to the expedition leader, John Hunt, they were welcomed with “handshakes – even, I blush to say, hugs”.\nIn 1966 the psychologist Sidney Jourard conducted a field study of couples sitting in coffee shops around the world. He found that in the Puerto Rican capital, San Juan, couples touched each other – by hand-holding, back-stroking, hair-caressing or knee-patting – an average of 180 times per hour. In Paris, it was 110 times; in Gainesville, Florida, it was twice; in London, never.\nJourard concluded that Americans and Britons lived under a “touch taboo”. In the US, this even extended to barbers using electric scalp massagers strapped to their hands so they did not touch their customers’ heads. Jourard wondered if the large number of massage parlours in British and American cities betrayed a need not being met in normal relationships. Many American motel rooms were equipped with Magic Fingers, a device which, on inserting a quarter, would slowly vibrate the bed. The machine, Jourard wrote, “has taken over another function of man – the loving and soothing caress”.\nThe new therapies that came out of California in the late 1960s sought to cure the English-speaking countries of their touchlessness. They prescribed generous doses of hugging. Bernard Gunther, of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur Hot Springs, taught full-body massage techniques as a path to sensory awakening. Some of Gunther’s more outré methods – mutual hair shampooing and the “Gunther hero sandwich” (a group of people spooning one another) – failed to catch on. But the massage therapists probably did help Britain and America become more tactile societies. By the 1980s, Magic Fingers machines had largely vanished from motel rooms.\nIn lockdown, the skin-hungry have once again been forced to improvise inadequate technical fixes. They hug themselves, or hug pillows and duvets, or tuck in their bed blankets tightly at night. The robotics industry has tried to replicate the feel of human touch with Bluetooth-enabled “hug shirts” and silicone lips that allow you to hold and kiss someone remotely. But it’s not the same and never will be, however good the technology gets. Nothing substitutes for human touch.\nAs a teenager, the autistic writer and activist Temple Grandin longed to feel the pressure stimulation of a hug. Like many autistic people, though, she found being touched difficult. One day, visiting her aunt’s Arizona ranch, she saw cattle being put in a squeeze chute: a pen with compressing metal sides, which kept them calm while they were branded or castrated. Thus inspired, she made her own human “squeeze machine”. It had two wooden boards, upholstered with thick padding and joined by hinges. When she kneeled inside it and turned on an air compressor, it felt like being hugged. For Grandin, this was a useful staging post on the way to touching people. In her mid-20s she learnt to shake hands. When she was 60, her squeeze machine finally broke, and she didn’t bother to fix it. “I’m into hugging people now,” she said.\nReal human touch is infinitely subtle and intricate – less a sense than a sensorium. Skin, which makes up nearly 20% of our bodies, is our largest and most sensitive organ. An area of skin the size of a £1 coin contains 50 nerve endings and 3ft of blood vessels. The work of touch is done by sensory receptors, buried in the skin at different depths according to what kind of stimulus they detect, such as warmth, cold or pain. One of these receptors, the Pacinian corpuscle, responds to pressure and vibration. It can detect movements smaller than a millionth of a metre.\nEverything we touch has its own specific shape, texture and firmness, its own special resistance to the pressure we place on it. Every hug feels different because everyone you hug takes up space in the world in a different way. No one else has quite the same contours, the same pleats and ripples in their clothes, the same warmth and weight, the same precise arrangement of flesh and bones. Your own body is a one-off, too. It folds into and nests with someone else’s in a way that no other body can.\n“Sending hugs,” people say online – but you can’t send a hug. A virtual hug only whets the appetite for what you’re missing, just as looking at food when you’re hungry makes you hungrier. The feeling you’re trying to share in a hug is all wrapped up in its embodiment in space and time. A hug joins the physical and emotional so tightly together that you can’t tell them apart. The writer Pádraig Ó Tuama points out that an Irish way of saying hug is duine a theannadh le do chroí: to squeeze someone with your heart.\nI wonder how it will feel when we can hug people again. Will we have to relearn the protocol, or will muscle memory kick in? Will our nerve endings have been deadened or hyper-sensitised by abstinence? Will we hug everyone too much and too hard, because our feeding habits have switched to feast-or-famine mode, like wolves who kill more than they can eat? One thing we do know now is that we are hardwired for touch. We were not meant to swerve away from each other in the street, or mime hugs through windows, or cuddle through walls of plastic. We were meant to hold people close, and feel the bones in their back and the rise and fall of their chests, and remind each other that we are warm bodies, still breathing, still alive.\nJoe Moran’s If You Should Fail: a Book of Solace (Viking, £14.99) is available from the Guardian Bookshop at £13.04"

    "raw_text": "It was just the authoritarian image Donald Trump hoped to project at the US Open: the president himself, looming from Arthur Ashe Stadium’s giant screens like Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Gate, as he stood at attention for the national anthem. But there was no denying that, while the picture was there, the sound clashed. The burst of cheers that went up for his stiff salute on Sunday was quickly drowned out by a chorus of boos made louder from the Ashe roof being closed for rain – perhaps fitting given that many fans had been left to stand in the wet and endure the long security lines that resulted from his attendance. In that awkward five-second moment, as the Stars and Stripes was unfurled on center court, the president smirked at the negative reaction. It surely rang so familiar.\nTrump’s presence at the US Open men’s final wasn’t just intended as a soft power grab, the kind of routine stunt Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and the other despots he admires pull all the time at sports events – except with recruitment ads for Ice playing across the US. No, Trump’s presence was intended as a distraction. Not a distraction for him; lord knows, he couldn’t care less about the actual match, a fact that was reinforced when Trump left his luxury box seat to step inside and kibitz with a phalanx of suck-ups. No, Trump’s visit was dropped like a flash bang to divert attention from klaxoning recession indicators, rumbling speculation about his health and, naturally, those files about that guy whose name must not be mentioned.\nIf Trump was motivated by a patriotic love for tennis, he would have rocked up a day earlier for the women’s final. But for Trump the prospect of cheering on Jersey girl Amanda Anisimova and her epic comeback story clearly wasn’t juicy enough, much less the idea of actually sharing the spotlight with an American player. So Sunday’s match-up between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz was retrofitted for Trump’s calliope Maga stage. Before the tilt Alcaraz, a Spaniard, was asked about playing in front of the president, and stepped right into the trap. “For me, playing in front of him, I don’t want myself to be nervous,” he said, not realizing his words would soon become fodder for Fox and Friends. “I think it’s great for tennis to have the president into the final.”\nFormer presidents have shown that you can appear at a US Open without making it about ego: the Obamas were clearly caught up in supporting a US player when they watched Frances Tiafoe battle Alcaraz in the 2022 semi-final. Bill Clinton was proudly Team USA, too. In 2000, in his final weeks as president, he broke away from the UN Millennium Summit for Pete Sampras’s semi-final against Lleyton Hewitt, joining John McEnroe in the commentary box and signing balls fans lobbed up to him as Secret Service minders looked on and snipers lined the stadium upper deck. Clinton also visited Sampras in the locker room after the loss to Hewitt, which postponed the American’s epic quest for a then-record 14th grand slam. In 2009 Clinton returned and gave the keynote speech for Arthur Ashe’s induction into the US Open’s Court of Champions. He remembered Ashe’s triumphs over segregation, apartheid and his efforts to open his sport up to under-resourced and represented communities.\nTrump’s presence on Sunday – under the Ashe stadium marquee, on grounds named for gender and LGBTQ+ pioneer Billie Jean King, at a tournament that makes a point of touting its unwavering commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion – didn’t just strike a marked contrast. It broke from the markedly lower profiles of past presidents and was over-the-top, even for a sport that regularly hosts royal families. But Trump simply couldn’t pass up the optics. Getting booed by a multicultural east coast crowd that laps up $23 cocktails and $100 caviar-dolloped chicken nuggets without irony is red meat his base would devour. And getting that last laugh would make for satisfying personal revenge, an urgent second-term theme.\nFor 40 years Trump exploited the US Open for clout, calling attention to himself, his luxury box perch and all the bold-faced names who joined him inside. But the New York crowd – the heart of the Open – never cottoned to his faux-gold flash and didn’t hesitate to jeer his big screen pop-ups even then. After the golden escalator ride to kick off his 2015 presidential campaign and the fiery announcement speech hitting out at immigrants and foreigners, he effectively became spectator non-grata in Flushing. Months later he attended the US Open quarter-final between Venus and Serena Williams and heard more boos as he slunk away with Melania, out of the stadium’s “President’s Gate”. So it meant something for him on Sunday to be back 10 years later, at the same event that was once the crown jewel of CBS and a lead-in for 60 Minutes – two more institutions he is determined to get even with – and back in the hometown he has repeatedly threatened to invade. That is, when he’s not outright declaring war on Chicago.\nBefore Trump’s arrival in his native borough of Queens, as foot soldiers from homeland security and other federal agencies swept the US Open campus, the USTA seemed as if it might do more to accommodate him than Rolex CEO Jean-Frederic Dufour – who had reportedly invited the president to the company’s luxury suite in hopes of catching a break on US tariffs imposed on Switzerland. No doubt Trump would have sat in the umpire’s chair if that were an option. The day before the men’s final, news broke that the USTA had issued a memo to broadcasters urging them to avoid showing any dissent against Trump in a craven display of anticipatory obedience that the federation cowardly justified in an 11-word statement. (We thought the former reality show host was supposed to be against unfair editing …) In the moments Trump actually seemed to be paying attention to Sunday’s match, he didn’t really cheer or applaud – which is weird but not surprising. He had made the day about himself, after all.\nAnd yet: just when it seemed as if the USTA couldn’t bow down any lower, intentionally or not, it may have pulled off a canny rope-a-dope. Perhaps mindful of the president’s avarice for stolen valor, they set the US Open men’s trophy inside the Rolex box for Trump’s arrival, and then switched it for a doubles cup after the anthem. Breaking with its own edict, the USTA not only showed Trump on the big screen again during the changeover between the first and second sets, it pushed in and held the shot for 20 seconds. The crowd, much larger this time, booed him so long and lustily that it was hard not to be reminded of the harsh reception to Trump at the 2019 World Series. Later on Sunday, the camera cut to noted Trump bugbear Bruce Springsteen – triggering a roar of approval that nearly blew the Ashe roof off.\nUnlike Fifa at July’s Club World Cup final, the USTA ensured Trump’s Rolex perch became a prison by the end of the match, so Alcaraz could keep up the winner’s tradition of climbing into the crowd to embrace their support team. Trump could only watch, like a kid on punishment seeing his friends play outside, as someone other than him presented the trophy to Alcaraz – because, well, he’s no competition for Ivan Lendl and much better men than Trump have tried taking trophies from the former No 1. After the pomp and circumstance, Trump was gone – back on the road within minutes of match point and in the air not long thereafter, according to the White House pool report. The outsized security presence that turned Sunday’s showcase into an authoritarian spectacle disappeared in his wake, too. For many fans who had suffered through it all, his departure was more cause for celebration.\nTheodore Roosevelt’s daughter, Alice, once said of her father that “he wants to be the bride at every wedding, the corpse at every funeral, and the baby at every christening.” But the line fits Trump even better. As long as there is attention to be had, you can bet he’ll find a way to make himself the center of it and make sport of self-aggrandizement, regardless of who, or what, he may trample over on his march."

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump was booed and cheered at the US Open during the national anthem before Sunday’s men’s final. When stadium monitors showed him saluting as a member of West Point performed The Star-Spangled Banner, a burst of cheers sprang up and was quickly drowned out by boos, at which point the president offered a brief smirk. After the first set, he reappeared on the big screen and stayed up there for a while – causing fans to boo even longer until the camera cut away.\nTrump’s return to the US Open marked his first time at the tournament since 2015, when he was booed after leaving a match between Serena and Venus Williams. Invited to this year’s tournament by Rolex, he sat in a suite next to a winner’s trophy among a welter of cabinet and family members. He arrived more than an hour before the scheduled start of the match and raised a triumphant fist for the cameras.\nMeanwhile, thousands of fans were left trickling into the match because of the heightened security around the president’s visit. The stadium was not yet at its expected capacity 45 minutes into the match, at which point Carlos Alcaraz already had a 6-2 lead over Jannik Sinner.\nIn a statement, the Secret Service said that protecting the president “required a comprehensive effort” that “may have contributed to delays for attendees”.\nTrump’s return to the Open is somewhat of a homecoming. He was once a fixture at the tournament, styling himself as a celebrity to dwarf all others from New York or Hollywood. During that time, he was often shown on the big screen and booed.\nBut after he kicked off his 2015 presidential campaign with a fiery announcement speech hitting out at immigrants and foreign allies, the prevailing attitude toward Trump in New York shifted negatively.\nThe reception Trump received from the crowd on Sunday was in marked contrast to the enthusiasm that went up for the match’s other prominent attendees. During a changeover in the second set, the camera cut to Bruce Springsteen, who has been the target of a fusillade of Trump criticism. The crowd cheered deliriously.\nThe US Tennis Association, which organizes the US Open, had emailed broadcasters requesting reactions to Trump not be shown. Despite that, Trump’s appearance during the anthem was briefly shown on ESPN in the US.\nA scattering of protestors stood outside the grounds before the match. Among them was Emma Kaplan, a 33-year-old executive assistant from Brooklyn, distributing flyers that read “The Fall of the Trump Fascist Regime.” She was joined by three members of RefuseFascism.org, one hoisting a poster that declared “GAME, SET, MATCH! NOV 5, FLOOD DC. TRUMP MUST GO!”; another’s sign demanded the shutdown of “the whole Trump fascist regime.”\nSome fans nodded quietly in approval. Others made their opposition clear.\n“Oh my bad, I voted for him,” one man muttered.\nKaplan brushed off the jeers. “Trump has historically been booed here,” she said. “He should be booed everywhere he goes. And on 5 November we’re calling for millions of people to come to Washington DC. They might try to silence our boos, but they can’t silence our rage.”"

    "raw_text": "The US jobs market stalled over the summer, adding just 22,000 jobs in August and continuing a slowdown in the labor market as businesses adjusted to disruptions caused by tariffs.\nThe latest jobs report also contained more bad news. The US lost 13,000 jobs in June, according to the latest survey, the first time it went into the negative since December 2020.\nThe unemployment rate for August inched up to 4.3%, the highest it has been since 2021.\nThe healthcare sector added 31,000 last month but most other sectors were flat or lost jobs.\nThe report highlighted worrying trends:\n-\nFederal employment dropped 15,000 jobs in August, totaling 97,000 jobs lost since January.\n-\nManufacturing jobs went down by 12,000 in August and have tumbled 78,000 for the year.\n-\nThe racial unemployment gap widened in August. Black Americans are seeing an unemployment rate of 7.5%, compared to 6.1% last August. The unemployment rate for White Americans is 3.7%\nThe closely watched data comes from a monthly survey of employers conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which has been under attack from Donald Trump after it revised its findings last month, showing that hiring in early summer was much weaker than initially reported.\nLast month the BLS slashed the number of new jobs created in May and June by by more than 250,000. The figures – revised when the bureau received more reports from businesses and government agencies – showed hiring over the summer was far weaker than first reported. The revised figures for May and June were 19,000 and 14,000, respectively – the lowest since the pandemic.\nThose figures were revised again this month. The BLS revised June’s tally down by 27,000, from +14,000 to -13,000, and the change for July was revised up by 6,000, from +73,000 to +79,000. Employment in June and July combined was 21,000 lower than previously reported.\nThough Trump claimed the revisions were “rigged in order to make the Republicans, and me, look bad”, August’s figures show that the slumped pattern has continued even after Trump fired the bureau’s commissioner in retaliation. Trump has nominated a conservative ally who helped write Project 2025 as the bureau’s commissioner, leaving many economists worried about the future of the bureau.\nAnd data from other sources besides the bureau has also highlighted stagnation in the labor market. The payroll firm ADP reported on Thursday that private employers added 54,000 jobs in August, nearly 20,000 below expectations. The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas also reported that job cuts reached 85,979 in August – up 39% from July and up 13% compared with August 2024.\n“The year started with strong job growth, but that momentum has been whipsawed by uncertainty. A variety of things could explain the hiring slowdown, including labor shortages, skittish consumers and AI disruption,” said Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP.\nThe Federal Reserve has been monitoring the labor market for signs that it may need to adjust interest rates. At his speech at the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium last month, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, seemed to hint that officials were leaning toward a rate cut at their next meeting on 17 September.\nThough Wall Street investors have been waiting for the Fed’s next rate cut, which would be its first since December, the next cut will probably come with caveats. Powell emphasized that it was still unclear what impact Trump’s tariffs and immigration policies will have on the economy.\n“There is significant uncertainty about where all of these policies will eventually settle and what their lasting effects on the economy will be,” he said.\nPowell warned that while there are new jobs being added each month, “the downside risks to employment are rising. And if those materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.”\nPowell, who was first appointed by Trump in 2017 and again by Biden in 2022, reaches the end of his second term in May 2026. Trump earlier this year walked back on threats to fire Powell after stock markets responded poorly to his comments and the supreme court implied that the Fed chair has special protection from termination.\nBut the White House has continued pressuring the Fed, including firing Lisa Cook, a Fed governor, for alleged mortgage fraud, and implying that the weak job numbers are due to the central bank’s inaction. On Friday, Trump and his cabinet zeroed in on Powell again and attacked the Fed for being “too late” to lower interest rates.\n“Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he’s “Too Late’!” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday.\nLori Chavez-DeRemer, labor secretary, told Fox Business that Powell “should be embarrassed by this report because he has not done his job”. Meanwhile, Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Friday morning, arguing that the Fed over the years has “blurred the lines between monetary and fiscal policy” and accused the Fed of “regulatory overreach”."

    "raw_text": "Prestigious news organizations gave scant attention when, for several days recently, Donald Trump faded from public view. Other than some social media posts and some blurry golf-course images, the normally ubiquitous president seemed almost to disappear.\nBut most of Big Journalism gave that subject a pass.\nGiven Trump’s obvious health problems – swollen ankles, an uneven gait, bruised hands and instances of verbal confusion – the media silence struck a lot of people as hypocrisy.\n“Why are the biggest newsrooms silent?” demanded Jon Passantino, who writes for the media newsletter Status. “No front-page write ups. No broadcast packages.” Trump’s health problems and near disappearance “barely registered in mainstream coverage”.\nBy contrast, the media went overboard with unrelenting coverage of Joe Biden’s old age, but it came late. Almost all of it followed the then president’s shockingly weak debate appearance during his 2024 re-election campaign.\nThere was plenty of finger-pointing – even a bestselling book by two media bigwigs – about the failures to report Biden’s decline earlier and about the White House’s efforts to obscure it.\nThis time, over the Labor Day weekend, wild rumors swirled on social media that Trump had died, or had suffered a debilitating stroke or a series of them. The much-read Drudge Report published a story with this headline: PRESIDENT HEALTH CRISIS DEEPENS.\nNevertheless, JD Vance seemed to target big media.\n“If the media you consumed told you that Donald Trump was on his deathbed because he didn’t do a press conference for three days, imagine what else they’re lying to you about,” Vance posted on X.\nThat translated, for the gullible, into the usual trashing of the mainstream press, a regular talking point from Magaworld.\nIn fact, big journalism was guilty of nothing of the sort; if anything, they took Trump’s disappearance too lightly.\nAs is often the case with Trump and his allies, there’s a lot of projection going on.\n“Imagine what else they’re lying to you about” is something that might, much more accurately, be said about Trump and his minions on any number of subjects.\nTrump joined in, too. “It’s fake news – it’s so fake. That’s why the media has so little credibility,” he responded to a Fox News question that conveniently set up this round of media-bashing. (“How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” asked Peter Doocy at a briefing after Trump re-emerged.)\nNonsense, of course. Most of the mainstream media was overly cautious, if anything, in approaching the topic.\nWhen the New York Times did get around to covering the issue, the paper took up the topic obliquely – focusing primarily on the false rumors of Trump’s death and then, much lower in a long story, addressing the paucity of information about his actual health. The headline: President Trump Is Alive. The Internet was Convinced Otherwise.\nThe story puts in historical context the tendency of White House staffs to obscure the physical problems of American presidents – from Woodrow Wilson’s stroke to John F Kennedy’s chronic back pain. Eventually, it makes the point that “justifiable concerns and questions about Mr Trump’s health have often been met with obfuscation or minimal explanation from the people around him”.\n(The White House in July explained Trump’s bruising and swelling as chronic venous insufficiency, but downplayed the condition as benign and common for older people; his doctor pronounced him in excellent health.)\nEven after an assassination attempt on Trump last year, no medical briefings were held. And, to my recollection, there was precious little investigative follow-up on that.\nYet, amid all of this, the White House press secretary claimed that Trump has been “completely transparent about his health with the public, unlike his predecessor”.\nAs usual, in Trumpworld, a lie outpaces the truth, and everything is Biden’s fault.\nSo what does responsible media coverage of this topic look like? The question evokes the Goldilocks fairytale: what’s too hot? What’s too cold? And what’s just right?\n“Evidence-based assessments of a president’s health are absolutely fair game” for journalists, Bill Grueskin of Columbia Journalism School told Associated Press media reporter David Bauder.\nAnd when someone as omnipresent in the media as Trump drops out of view for days? That’s fair game, too.\nWith Trump now in his 80th year – he turned 79 in June – these questions are not going away. Rampant speculation certainly isn’t the answer, but it tends to flood in when there is a vacuum of real information.\nThe unquestioning acceptance of White House reassurance isn’t the answer either.\nIn good journalism, “just right” is founded on skepticism and addressed by persistence – by doggedly digging out the facts and presenting them forthrightly.\n-\nMargaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture"

    "raw_text": "Congress returned to session on Tuesday, and with it comes a political headache for Donald Trump in the form of renewed attention on the investigation into the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and his death, a subject that the president has sought to avoid in recent weeks.\nWhile the president got a month-long break from the Epstein issue when lawmakers left town for the annual August recess – with the House of Representatives wrapping up a day early because of the controversy over Epstein – the calm will probably end quickly. Representatives from both parties have planned press conferences and legislative maneuvers intended to put pressure on the Trump administration for more transparency over Epstein, whose suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019 has been the subject of conspiracy theories the president amplified while on the campaign trail.\nThe Republican congressman Thomas Massie announced he had filed a legislative maneuver known as a discharge petition that could force a vote in the House on legislation mandating the release of investigative files related to Epstein, over the objections of the speaker, Mike Johnson.\nThe petition needs 218 signatures to succeed and is expected to attract support from most, if not all, Democrats as well as some Republicans, but it is unclear if it will prevail. However, even if the bill passes, it still must be approved by the Senate, and it is unclear if the majority leader, John Thune, will allow it to be considered.\nMeanwhile, victims of Epstein are on Capitol Hill to meet with Johnson, a source familiar with the speaker’s schedule told the Guardian. They will also sit down with lawmakers on the House oversight committee, which is investigating the government’s handling of the financier’s case.\nThe Democratic congresswoman and oversight committee member, Ayanna Pressley, said the encounter “is a step toward the healing, accountability, and transparency survivors deserve”.\n“As the oversight committee continues its investigation, I continue to demand the release of the full, unredacted Epstein files with the names of survivors protected,” she added.\nOn Wednesday, Massie and the Democratic congressman Ro Khanna will hold a press conference with the victims to make the case that investigative files pertaining to Epstein should be made public.\n“I pray [Johnson]will listen to the pleas of these victims for justice and quit trying to block a vote on our legislation to release the Epstein files,” Massie, who has broken with Trump on several high-profile issues since his second term began, wrote on X.\nTrump campaigned on getting to the bottom of conspiracy theories that have swirled around Epstein since his death, but sparked the fury of some of his supporters after the justice department announced in July that it had determined the financier died by suicide and that the long-rumored list of his clients does not exist. The department also said it would release no further details about the case, sparking a clamor among lawmakers who argued the investigative files pertaining to Epstein should be made public.\nThe White House has since been looking for ways to assuage the demands for transparency, including by pushing for the release of grand jury transcripts related to Epstein’s indictment, and sending the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, to Florida to spend two days interviewing his jailed accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. But those meetings produced little new information, while a judge has refused to make the grand jury proceedings public.\nDemocrats view the issue as a rare one with the ability to drive a wedge between the president and his supporters, while Trump has decried it as a distraction.\n“The whole thing is a hoax. It’s put out by the Democrats because we’ve had the most successful six months in the history of our country and that’s just a way of trying to divert attention to something that’s total bullshit,” he said in August.\nJohnson, a persistent defender of the president and his policies, has struggled to find ways to quell the concerns of Republican lawmakers that fear opposing the release of the files will put them on the wrong side of their constituents.\nOn Tuesday, Republican leaders proposed a resolution that directs the House oversight committee “to continue its ongoing investigation” into the Epstein matter. Massie blasted it as a “meaningless vote to provide political cover for those members who don’t support our bipartisan legislation to force the release of the Epstein files”.\nLed by its Republican chair and Trump ally, James Comer, the oversight committee has sent a slew of subpoenas to former top government officials who may have knowledge of how previous administrations, including Trump’s first term, handled the allegations against the financier. Among those who received summons were the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton as well as Bill Clinton, who associated with Epstein in the past.\nThe committee has also demanded documents from the justice department and Epstein’s estate, and on Sunday asked the treasury for suspicious activity reports related to Epstein.\n“The House oversight committee is conducting a thorough review of the federal investigation into the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. We are committed to providing full transparency to the American people,” Comer said in a statement after the resolution was announced."

    "raw_text": "At the end of an excruciating season filled with near-misses and heartbreak at the final hurdle, Aryna Sabalenka began her third consecutive US Open final with one final chance to win the grand slam title she felt she was owed.\nThis occasion could have been the source of more anxiety and stress, another reason for her to fall apart, but Sabalenka’s increasingly legendary career has been driven by her ability to recover and learn from her worst losses, no matter how painful they are. This time, the No 1’s nerves perfectly held up under pressure as she maintained her composure during a late surge from Amanda Anisimova before closing her US Open title defence with a 6-3, 7-6 (3) win.\nAs the best player in the world at the peak of her powers, Sabalenka continues to establish herself as one of the greatest players of her generation. She has now won four grand slam titles, drawing level with Kim Clijsters, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, Naomi Osaka and Hana Mandlikova. Sabalenka has established an era of dominance on hard courts, earning her four major titles with an equal share of victories at the Australian and US Open. She has now also reached six consecutive grand slam finals on hard courts.\nEight weeks after being overpowered by Anisimova in their semi-final match at Wimbledon, Sabalenka played a smart match, maintaining pressure on Anisimova with her first strike tennis but also playing with greater margin than her opponent and making use of her more well-rounded game. Most importantly, she kept her cool even when the match became complicated at the end.\n“I think because of the finals earlier this season, this one felt different,” said Sabalenka. “This one felt like I had to overcome a lot of things to get this one. I knew that the hard work we put in, like, I deserved to have a grand slam title this season. So when I fell, it was like truly emotions, because it means a lot to defend this title and to bring such great tennis on court. And to bring the fight and be able to handle my emotions the way I did in this final, it means a lot. I’m super proud right now of myself.”\nFrom the beginning, both players made it clear that in a match between two of the most lethal shotmakers in the sport, nothing but the most fearless and clear-headed attacking tennis would be sufficient. After a nervous start, Anisimova worked her way into the match with the destructive ball striking off both wings that guided her through immense wins over Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka this week. However, under pressure on such a significant occasion and against an ultra-focused Sabalenka who pummeled her second serve, served well enough in key moments and offered few unforced errors, Anisimova was felled by her own mistakes.\nDeep in the second set, Anisimova was finally granted a lifeline. With Sabalenka two points from victory on her serve at 6-3, 5-4, the Belarusian showed her nerves at 30-30 by completely misjudging a straightforward smash, slamming it into the net. Anisimova snatched the lead immediately, pounding a forehand winner to take the break before rolling through her subsequent service game.\nThis could have been the moment she began to fall apart, all of her painful memories from this season rushing back. Instead, Sabalenka refused to let her emotions get the better of her and she closed out her fourth grand slam title with a faultless tie-break. Remarkably, Sabalenka has now won the last 19 tiebreaks she has played, a run that dates back to February.\nOf all the tight losses Sabalenka endured this year, no defeat was as painful as her three-set defeat to Coco Gauff in the French Open final. Sabalenka had entered the final convinced she was mentally and physically ready for any challenge that came her way. Instead, she fell apart mentally on the court and then lashed out afterwards in the press room, which became a source of shame as well as disappointment. Sabalenka also lost to Madison Keys in the Australian Open final.\n“After those two finals where I completely lost control over my emotions, I just didn’t want that to happen again,” said Sabalenka. “There were a few moments when I was this close to just let it go. I was like ‘C’mon now, you have to stay focused. Keep going, keep trying.’” It’s really helped me. I think I have to keep the same mindset every time – hopefully I’m going to make many more finals – so every time I’m in the final, I have to stick to the same plan.”\nOn another enormous occasion against an American opponent, the New York crowd desperately cheering for her downfall all evening, Sabalenka put herself back together under some of the most challenging circumstances possible, pulling off a victory that may well guide her to even greater successes in the future.\nHaving given herself another shot at a grand slam final at the next possible occasion after her 6-0, 6-0 defeat to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon, this time Anisimova played a competitive match and fought hard at the end, but she was simply too erratic against the best player in the world. As Sabalenka entered her player box in the crowd to embrace her loved ones, a tearful Anisimova was comforted in her chair by the tournament director Stacey Allaster. “I think I didn’t fight enough for my dreams today,” Anisimova said.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "When the dust finally settles in the days after Sunday’s eagerly awaited US Open men’s final, the United States Tennis Association will issue its annual victory-lap press release. It will tout another record-setting Open: more than a million fans through the gates, unprecedented social-media engagement, double-digit growth in food and beverage sales, and hundreds of celebrities packed into suites from Rolex to Ralph Lauren. It will beam about growing the game, championing diversity and turning Flushing Meadows into a pop-culture destination.\nBut for all the milestones the USTA is teeing up to celebrate, this year’s tournament will be remembered for a different kind of first: the governing body’s lamentable decision to ask broadcasters not to show dissent against Donald Trump. In making that pre-emptive concession, the USTA has committed an unforced error that can’t be undone: sacrificing credibility in order to shield a politician – any politician, regardless of party, ideology or affiliation – from the sound of public disapproval.\nAccording to internal emails obtained by outlets including PA and Bounces, the USTA instructed its television partners to “refrain from showcasing any disruptions or reactions” when Trump appears on screen during Sunday’s final. A separate note reminded staff he would be seated in Rolex’s suite as a client guest. The 11-word statement to the Guardian on Saturday night from a USTA spokesperson – “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions” – is so weak it could buckle under the weight of its own hypocrisy. (Rolex did not respond to a request for comment.)\nThis is, after all, the same tournament that happily televised a climate protester gluing himself to a seat for nearly an hour during Coco Gauff’s semi-final win over Karolina Muchova two years ago, along with countless other fan disturbances. The same tournament that shrugs at the drunken buffoonery behind its US Bro-pen reputation. The Open practically invented televising distractions. Chaos is its brand. For the USTA to draw the line at showing boos for a sitting president is not “policy consistency” but capitulation.\nAnd to what end? Because of the fear that Trump – once a fixture at the US Open but loudly booed on his last visit in 2015, three months after announcing his first presidential campaign – may once again be exposed as unpopular before a global audience? Because of the fear that a chorus of jeers could overshadow the match itself? But that fear misunderstands both sport and democracy.\nCrowd dissent on broadcasts is not a breakdown of civic order. It is its expression. Then UK home secretary Theresa May was booed at the 2012 London Paralympics. French president Emmanuel Macron was whistled during the 2023 Rugby World Cup opening ceremony in Paris. In the US, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is all but guaranteed a chorus of boos during public appearances, and that’s practically a standing ovation next to the venom reserved for NHL commissioner Gary Bettman from fans. And Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, have been given hostile receptions by sports crowds. Somehow the United Kingdom, France and the United States survived those incidents intact.\nThat the USTA thinks Trump must be insulated from reality hints at something darker. It is reminiscent of regimes where the leader’s image must be protected from public ridicule. It shows how much Trump’s first term – and his bullying of cultural institutions – still shapes behavior. In his first presidency, he was broadly reviled by athletes and sports bodies. Now, as Tom Dart wrote before this year’s Super Bowl, he is increasingly accommodated or treated with silence.\nThe Open is supposed to be New York’s tournament, brash and democratic, rowdy and unfiltered, vibrant and exuberantly multicultural, where the crowd is as much a presence as the players on the court. By sanitizing its reaction, the USTA isn’t just shielding Trump. It is stripping the event of its unique character, authenticity and integrity.\nThat irony cuts even deeper because the Open has always been at the forefront of progress. It was the first of the majors to award equal prize money to women and men, long before other sports caught up. It platformed, embraced and celebrated LGBTQ+ athletes decades before it was fashionable to do so, from Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova in the 1970s to Renée Richards breaking ground as one of the first transgender athletes in professional tennis, to Open Pride nights today. And this year’s theme, “75 years of breaking barriers”, honors Althea Gibson, who in 1950 became the first Black player to compete at the tournament’s predecessor, the US nationals, and went on to clear a path for generations of Black players who followed. Her story is literally built into the grounds this fortnight, from the banners and installations designed by Melissa Koby – the first Black artist to create the Open’s theme art – to the constant reminders that the sport has prided itself on inclusion.\nFrom a Maga vantage point, of course, it probably looks like the Woke Super Bowl: King’s name on the gates, Gibson’s silhouette over Ashe Stadium, Serena and Venus Williams lionized, rainbow-tinged Pride nights, and a governing body trumpeting diversity at every turn. Which, if we’re being honest, may be one reason Trump is showing up in the first place: a 4D chess move with the intent of turning a tennis match into another battleground of grievance. Getting booed by thousands of fans drinking $23 vodka-lemonades won’t exactly be a bad look for his base, especially in a corrupt, disgusting hellhole like New York.\nFans will still do what fans do. If they want to boo, they will boo. But millions at home may never see it, thanks to a governing body that has chosen to act less like a guardian of sport and more like a nervous producer of campaign stagecraft. For a sport that prides itself on honesty and clarity – the ball is in or out – it is a shameful retreat."

    "raw_text": "Every August, the US Open rolls into Queens with its ever-expanding rituals of consumption. Fans don’t just buy in, they perform it: the $23 Honey Deuce held aloft for Instagram, the $40 lobster roll posted before the first serve, the $100 caviar-topped chicken nuggets bought as much for the flex as the flavor. The tennis has never been the cheapest day out, but lately the sticker shock feel less like a barrier than the point. The price tags are festival markers, proof that what was once a tournament with posh accents has morphed into a cultural happening. In what seems like a remarkably short time, New York’s major has become less sporting event than aspirational brand.\nThe final grand slam tournament of the season, which concludes Sunday with a mouth-watering men’s final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, has never completely shied from its tony roots as part of the New York “social season”, but its latest evolution has taken it past a major sporting event into a festival economy. The sport is still there – highlight-reel shots, lung-busting rallies, after-midnight thrillers – but the real main draw are cocktails priced like small bond issues, influencer blocs in branded bucket hats and a dating show filmed courtside. The spectacle isn’t Sinner’s thunderbolt serve or Aryna Sabalenka’s power-baseline game but whether Chloe Malle is Anna Wintour’s plus-one or Kareem Rahma of Subway Takes posts his courtside selfie before or after the Honey Deuce runs dry. That libation, once just a cute themed lemonade and vodka in a souvenir cup, has mutated into an inflation-defying fetish object with its own merch line. Entire kiosks now sell Honey Deuce shirts and trucker hats in pastel colorways, so you can broadcast your melon-ball allegiance long after the hard-won hangover fades. It’s less a drink than a franchise, an alcoholic Funko Pop, proof that you didn’t just attend the Open: you consumed it, posted it, stacked it, wore it and recycled it into personal branding.\nThe Open, known as the US national championships until 1968, has been staged every year since 1881, but its defining feature over the past decade or so has been sprawl: temporal, spatial, financial and, increasingly, attention-economical. Starting this year, the tournament expanded its footprint by starting on a Sunday rather than Monday, stretching the long-familiar 14-day format into 15, or effectively 20 if you count the controversial, purist-rankling mixed doubles event the week before. It is no longer just two weeks in late August and September straddling Labor Day, but a near-month-long residency in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, calibrated to command not just your time and money but your feed. The prize fund for this year’s event climbed to an eye-watering $90m (£66.6m), the highest single-event purse in tennis history and a 20% jump from 2024. On the ground the United States Tennis Associaton has gone maximalist, rubber-stamping an $800m renovation of Arthur Ashe Stadium (separate from the recent three-year transformation that expanded the square-footage of the property). A $250m Player Performance Center is going up alongside it, kitted out to house 2,800 athletes and entourages, all part of the global arms race in sporting infrastructure. Meeting the luxe standard of Wimbledon is no longer enough; the pressure now is keeping up with Indian Wells and Madrid too.\nAnd in today’s climate the most significant currency is attention. Once upon a time the US Open existed in the collective imagination for two weeks; now it seeps across August and September, propped up by the USTA’s celebrity program, influencer activations and, yes, its new in-house dating show. Game, Set, Matchmaker – eight couples on first dates filmed around the grounds – is an explicit attempt to hijack the Love Island economy and make tennis trend on YouTube. It may scandalize traditionalists, but it’s entirely of a piece with a tournament that now produces as much reality TV as it does actual reality.\nAmanda Wight, the USTA’s director of international strategy, marketing and celebrity management, has become the impresario of this circuit. A soft-focus New York Times profile on Thursday detailed how she grew up in a tiny fishing village in South Australia, yet now knows exactly when Gigi Hadid’s SUV pulls up to the President’s Gate, slips a colored band on her wrist and escorts her past the phalanx of photogs on the blue carpet. In another life she might be curating a DJ lineup in the desert; now she’s booking Olivia Munn and John Mulaney into Ashe and ensuring Coco Gauff’s selfie with Simone Biles makes its way to Instagram. Celebrities don’t simply “drop by” anymore. They are recruited, logged and tracked like assets in a derivatives portfolio. The USTA enlists consultants to measure the engagement value of each famous face: how many posts, how many tags, how many millions of impressions. Those numbers determine whether you get another invite. The Open has built its own influencer exchange, trading futures contracts on Queen Latifah’s Instagram story. If you’ve been wondering why your feeds have become lousy with selfies snapped inside Ashe, often with an obligatory postscript like “thanks @americanexpress” or JPMorgan Chase or Emirates or some random make-up brand, it’s not an accident. From F1 paddocks to NBA front rows, modern sports all court star power. But in New York, the Open has turned it into something close to an art form. At times it feels less like a stop on the tennis tour than an aperitif to Fashion Week. The stands double as a runway, the sponsor suites as showrooms.\nBrands have always hovered around tennis, but now they’ve colonized every space across of the grounds. Rolex maintains its discreet, air-conditioned sanctuary where you can hear Novak Djokovic muttering to himself while politely slicing carrot cake topped with chocolate tennis balls. It feels like a Geneva watch fair disguised as a tennis match, a cool temple of precision where the $300,000 Daytona on a collector’s wrist matters as much as the scoreline. Just a few sections away, Graza Olive Oil commandeers a matrix of lower box seats packed with digital creators, influencers and fashion TikTokers. If Rolex is haute couture, Graza is streetwear – and both are equally stitched into the US Open’s cultural fabric. The levels of service for the VIP and VVIP sets inside Ashe have always caught my attention since my first year covering the Open in 2008 – there have always been different restaurants and hospitality experiences available exclusively to the various tiers of premium ticket holders – but the present-day setup has scaled it to entirely new late-capitalist levels.\nFrom a labor-studies perspective the irony is stark: ball kids sweating through 10-hour shifts, concession workers hustling food priced like fine dining, facilities staff removing garbage and re-stocking bathrooms, security guards scanning QR codes to keep the economy moving – all so celebrities can glide through a velvet-roped experience and post their carefully staged candids. The festival economy, whether in Coachella’s desert or Flushing Meadows’ heat, runs on the underpaid many serving the overexposed few. Yet sociologically, it’s more complicated. The Open has long prided and marketed itself as the “people’s slam”: No 7 subway rides, raucous night sessions going past 2am, the roar from Ashe echoing down Roosevelt Avenue when a match tips into a fifth set. That energy is still real and palpable, but it is increasingly filtered through fan performance and the ceaseless din of conversation during matches, especially inside the main two stadiums. Attending is no longer just about watching; it is about being seen watching. For a growing subset of fans, that means turning the Open into content. Taylor Fritz’s girlfriend Morgan Riddle, dubbed by the Times as “the most famous woman in men’s tennis”, has argued that “fangirls” drive the memes and the merch. Tommy Paul’s fiancée, the Dairy Boy founder Paige Lorenze, folds the action into her lifestyle vlogs. They’re not just spectators but producers, treating Ashe as both stadium and studio.\nMedia theory would call this the triumph of the attention economy. What the USTA and its sponsors have achieved is a transformation of a two-week tournament into an endlessly scrollable feed. The result is a hybrid of competition and content, where the cutaways to Kevin Hart mugging from a suite or the Kylie Jenner-Timothée Chalamet hard launch are as important as the next break point. Anything popular becomes corporatized, as Chris Black, the podcaster and vibe consultant, puts it. The Open is no different.\nAnd yet the fans seem to love it. Attendance topped a million for the first time last year. Every person you follow on Instagram or TikTok seems to be there. For all the complaints about how grounds passes used to cost $60 (not that long ago), or how tickets are directly siphoned to the resale market and never hit the box office at face value (unconfirmed but probably true), and broader carping about how the regular fan is getting priced out, the uncomfortable truth is that admission could probably be even more expensive and the place would still sell out. We normies complain about the influencer zoo, then double-tap its highlights. It’s the same contradiction that keeps Coachella oversold and Art Basel hashtagged within an inch of its life. In that sense the Open is both groundbreaker and windsock: it’s setting the tone for how sport can be repackaged as culture while also reflecting the social economy we already live in.\nSo is it bad? From one angle, yes: the commodification of everything, from caviar-flecked poultry to celebrity cameos, can be seen as crass or even obscene. But from another, it is simply the way we live now. Tennis is not immune to the elemental logics of virality, and if the price of cultural relevance is a $23 cocktail, a marked-up hoodie, a dating show on YouTube and a 20-day schedule, that may be the collateral of a deal we’ve already entered long ago. The ball is still in play, but somewhere between Queens and Indio, the US Open has become a festival of its own: less about forehands and backhands than about selfies, sponsorships and sprawl."

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump’s last trip to the US Open did not go as smoothly as his 2015 presidential campaign kickoff. Three months after that gold-plated escalator ride, Trump was booed upon arriving at the VIP entrance at Arthur Ashe Stadium and booed again when he was shown on the big screen during that night’s quarter-final match between Venus and Serena Williams. He hasn’t shown his face at Billie Jean National Tennis Center since.\nTrump, of course, would be first to say he had more pressing matters to attend to over the past eight years. Currently, he is facing four separate indictments related to his time as US president – not least 34 counts here in New York for alleged hush money payments to an adult film star. Perhaps Trump would never have sunk this low if he had stuck to his role as the US Open’s unofficial celebrity mascot instead of moving into politics. But that role also helped his late-stage career change. Nowadays, though, you would be hard-pressed to find any trace of the relationship around the US Open grounds. Trump doesn’t talk about his time here anymore. Neither does the USTA. It’s almost as if an affair that lasted nearly 40 years never happened.\nTrump and the US Open were once a love match in mutual attention-seeking and ego-stroking that history struggles to appreciate now. When they began seriously courting each other in the late 1970s, the US Open had just relocated from genteel country club surrounds in Forest Hills to its current digs here on the site of the 1964 World’s Fair, with the idea of evolving into a spectacle for more than just tennis. And Trump was a small-time local real estate developer with designs on outdoing his father. But thanks to a boom in quality American tennis players, the US Open mushroomed into a cultural force that eventually sucked in Fashion Week, the MTV’s Video Music Awards and other seasonal New York rites.\nAll the while Trump looked like a poor-man’s vision of a rich tennis fan during his appearances at the US Open – braying into his cell phone well before the things were ubiquitous, signing dollar bills for rubberneckers, backhandedly shushing a young Barron and otherwise playing the role of Titus at the Colosseum.\nTrump was among the first in line for an Ashe Stadium luxury suite (valued at $200,000 for the duration of the tournament in the early 2000s), reportedly renting two at one point. (The USTA says the Trump Organization hasn’t signed another lease since giving up its box in 2017.) From that perch he became a bellwether of sorts, gossip columnists scrutinized his celebrity guests (American treasure Kevin Bacon, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, sitting president Bill Clinton) and fashion critics snarked at Trump’s habit of turning up in the same dark suit/bright tie ensemble like a comic-book villain – The Donald, as he was known back then. If sportswriters charted the wind with Trump’s hair, it’s because his presence was the surest indicator of a big story.\nEven the glamor girls Trump chose to decorate his suite with mark time. In 1998 it was Kylie Bax, a New Zealander who had one curious fan yelling: “Who’s the broad?” In 2003 it was Lisa Cant, an 18-year-old Canadian who was being touted as the next Kate Moss. For the all-Williams final in 2001, three days before the Twin Towers fell, Trump was joined in his suite by his ex-wife, Ivana, and future wife, Melania. Nineteen years later, a former model named Amy Dorris alleged to the Guardian that Trump sexually assaulted her outside the bathroom in his private suite at the tournament in 1997 when she was 24 (via his lawyers, Trump has strongly denied having ever harassed, abused or behaved improperly toward Dorris.)\nWhen Trump wasn’t lording over the US Open from on high, he could count on a prominent seat in the players’ box – next to then-Chris Evert beau Andy Mill for the American Sweetheart’s US Open farewell in 1989, beside Brooke Shields for Andre Agassi’s comeback tale in 1994, by himself for Caroline Wozniacki’s 2010 semi-final run (“There’s always a place for Mr Trump,” the Danish former No 1 said at the time.) Pat Rafter celebrated his US Open titles in 1997 and 1998 with Trump at the Park Avenue Country Club. A superstitious Andy Murray was a guest at Trump International Hotel for a stint after his 2012 stay there culminated in his first career major title (Murray has since mocked Trump on X, formerly Twitter. He is one of the few high-profile players to hit out at the former president).\nIn her 1991 title victory speech a teenage Monica Seles thanked Trump – who was rumoured to have helped the world No 1 drop off the radar for a six-week stretch that saw her miss Wimbledon. “He was the one person that kind of said the whole two weeks that I could do it,” she said. The crowd had a go at them both. Trump never completely won them back. Boos often greeted his seemingly obligatory appearances on the big screen. Before long, the negativity became something to revel in.\nIt should surprise no one that, given his long history of misogyny, Trump seemed particularly keen on mansplaining his way around women’s tennis. In a 2004 Inside Tennis interview he was particularly obsessed with just-crowned Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova – doubting her business acumen in one breath (offering up “the right management”), doting on her like a prize horse the next (“her gait is magnificent … and those shoulders”) before concluding that her looks were what ultimately pushed her past Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final. “I think [Serena] looked across the court and said: ‘I’m playing against a supermodel.’ I think it had an impact.”\nBut Trump was also hugely keen on the Williams sisters. The Philadelphia Inquirer’s match report from Venus’s 1997 US Open final clash against Martina Hingis makes a point of noting how Trump celebrated her biggest winners with an approving fist pump. In 2000 he volunteered to pay in excess of $1m to sponsor a Battle of the Sexes reboot pitting either Williams sister against John McEnroe, and seemed genuinely more interested in watching a repeat of history – this time, with teenagers beating up on a middle-aged man. Trump rang in the 2015 new year dancing with Serena at Mar-a-Lago. When an angry outburst at a lineswoman after a controversial foot fault call helped doom Serena in the 2009 semi-final, Trump didn’t hold back either. “[The lineswoman] had a smirk on her face and was being a wise guy,” he wrote in a post for the leadership section of the Trump University blog. “The backlash against Serena has been relentless, and she has been treated badly. She has apologized, and I think enough is enough.”\nTrump was unlike any other American tennis patron, one who in the late 1980s was as wont to support the USTA’s bid to keep the Open in Queens as push to move it back to Manhattan. At the dawn of Trump’s Apprentice fame in 2004, the USTA tapped him for a campaign to encourage participation in the sport. “If you don’t go to TennisWelcomeCenter.com,” Trump said in one endorsement video, “you’re fired.” A print version of the same advert had him sitting behind a desk holding a gold racket. The women’s tour wrangled him for their own promos, too. At the time the federation celebrated him as a youth ambassador of indeterminate value. Never mind that the man himself was pushing 60.\nIn hindsight it’s a wonder Trump hung around the US Open for so long. When he ultimately did slink away, it was well overdue. He can draw plenty of big crowds on his own – ones that not only root for him, but help him attempt to reverse a presidential election. The US Open dominates New York’s cultural scene to the point of becoming a shrine for social climbers to practice conspicuous consumption – an all-American cultural symbol. The transactional relationship served its purpose for the tournament and for Trump. That both sides appear happy to stay apart speaks to just how drastically America’s course has diverged."

    "raw_text": "The past few weeks have brought a torrent of bad news for those who care about CBS News – the home of the legendary Walter Cronkite and a great deal of investigative journalism over many decades.\nMost notably, the network’s parent company, Paramount Global, capitulated to the Trump administration, unnecessarily – and wimpily – settling a lawsuit by paying $16m, purportedly for a future presidential library.\nTrump had sued over a story on 60 Minutes, the network’s flagship program, claiming it was deceptively edited to favor his then-rival for the presidency, Kamala Harris. After the settlement was announced, Trump crowed that the network had “defrauded the American people” and was desperate to settle; he also claimed that another $20m in advertising and programming was also coming his way.\nDays later, another troubling sign. The network decided to dump The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the top-rated show on late-night television, whose host has been relentlessly critical of Trump. Network bosses claimed the move was financial, since the show was losing money. But it wasn’t hard to connect the dots and see this as part of an all-out effort to appease the president.\nThe Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren called for answers in a Variety op-ed, asking: “Are we sure that this wasn’t part of a wink-wink deal between the president and a giant corporation that needed something from his administration?”\nThat “something” is federal clearance for an $8bn merger between Paramount and another giant media corporation, Skydance. (The latter company is doing its kowtowing part, promising to “evaluate any complaints of bias” at CBS News, appoint an ombudsman to keep watch, and ensure there are no diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Paramount. The proposed merger got approval on Thursday from the FCC, which means that it’s essentially a done deal.)\nColbert’s on-air commentary on the settlement was brutal: “This kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles. It’s ‘big, fat bribe’.” Could it be a complete coincidence that The Late Show was canceled three days later?\nAmid all this, one positive development this week shone through like a wan blade of light. A new executive producer for 60 Minutes – the top editorial role – got the nod. To the relief of many there, Tanya Simon is no outsider who might have been tapped to make the show more Trump-friendly.\nSimon has deep roots at the revered program – a 25-year veteran of 60 Minutes, she is also the daughter of the late CBS correspondent Bob Simon. She has been the acting executive producer since the previous executive producer, Bill Owens, resigned under pressure, saying he felt he no longer had the full editorial independence he had always enjoyed.\nHer appointment, of course, doesn’t mean no political pressure will be exerted from corporate bosses above her, who seem to be under Trump’s sway.\n“There is great fear about what comes next,” one CBS News staffer told CNN earlier this month. Simon’s appointment offers at least a modest measure of reassurance.\nShe “understands what makes ‘60 minutes’ tick,” said the news division’s president, Tom Cibrowski, in a memo to staff. She’s also the first woman, in the show’s nearly six-decade history, to be at the helm.\nIf the choice had been a right-leaning newcomer, it’s a good bet that top quality talent like Scott Pelley – a former chief White House correspondent and a former anchor of the CBS Evening News – would have quickly headed for the door.\nAs for the future of CBS, once admired enough to be dubbed the Tiffany Network, the outlook is mixed.\n“I know that the C in CBS stands for Columbia, but … it ought to be called the Contradiction Broadcasting Network,” wrote Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Will Bunch.\nThat’s always been true, he argued, given the bright journalistic legacy of Cronkite and Edward R Murrow along with some ugly chapters in the distant past. That includes the time when – under fire from the FBI director J Edgar Hoover in the late 1940s – the network demanded that all its employees sign a loyalty oath to the US government.\nWhen it comes to integrity, that history of contradiction is bad enough.\nCapitulation, though, is far worse. And given recent events, it’s easy to make the case that CBS – or, more accurately, its parent company – deserves that acronym even more.\n-\nMargaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump has reached a $16m settlement with Paramount, the parent of CBS News, over what he claimed was false editing of a pre-election interview with the Democratic candidate for president, Kamala Harris, in what is likely to be seen as a further example of capitulation by media companies hoping to smooth the waters with Trump.\nTrump had filed a $10bn lawsuit against the company in October, one of a string of legal actions against US media conglomerates over what the US president maintains was biased, incorrect or “fake” news reporting.\nIn a late-night announcement, Paramount – which is preparing for a $8.4bn merger that requires approval from the the US Federal Communications Commission, headed by Trump loyalist Brendan Carr – said it would pay the sum to settle the suit.\nIt said the money would be allocated, at Trump’s discretion, either to his future presidential library or to charitable causes, and not paid to Trump “directly or indirectly”.\n“The settlement does not include a statement of apology or regret,” the company statement added.\nA spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told the Wall Street Journal that the settlement was “another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit”.\nThe lawsuit alleged that CBS, via its news show 60 Minutes, deceptively edited an interview with Harris – then the US vice-president as well as the Democratic presidential candidate – to “tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party” in the election. On the campaign trail last year, Trump threatened to revoke CBS’s broadcasting licence if elected.\nThe lawsuit also alleged that CBS aired two versions of the interview in which Harris appeared to give different answers to the same question about the Israel-Hamas war. CBS said the lawsuit was “completely without merit” and had asked a judge to dismiss it.\nIn an amended complaint filed in February, Trump increased his claim for damages to $20bn and added a claim that CBS’s editing of the interview violated the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, which makes it illegal to use false, misleading or deceptive acts in commerce.\nThe lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee. The case entered mediation in April.\nThe settlement includes an agreement that 60 Minutes would release transcripts of interviews with future US presidential candidates after they aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Edward A Paltzik, a lawyer representing Trump in the civil suit, could not be immediately reached for comment.\nPaltzik has previously said “real accountability for CBS and Paramount will ensure that the president is compensated for the harm done to him, and will deter the fake news from further distorting the facts to advance a partisan agenda”.\nThe settlement comes as Paramount prepares for an $8.4bn merger with Skydance Media, which requires the approval of federal regulators at the FCC.\nBut US and California lawmakers have said any settlement may violate bribery laws.\n“Paramount appears to be trying to settle a lawsuit that it has assessed as ‘completely without merit’,” the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Ron Wyden said in a May letter to Paramount’s chair, Shari Redstone.\n“Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act.\n“If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials, they may be breaking the law.”\nSanders said it was “a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press – an essential part of our democracy. It is a victory for a president who is attempting to stifle dissent and undermine American democracy.”\nThe settlement is the latest example of media corporate parent companies making concessions to Trump and the Trump administration, which frequently casts unfavorable coverage as “fake news”.\nOn Tuesday, Trump and the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, threatened to sue CNN over its reporting on an app designed to help people avoid Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and over the reporting of a damage assessment on Iran’s nuclear facilities that was unfavorable to the administration’s claims.\nThe settlement also comes after Meta Platforms, the Facebook and Instagram parent company, said on 29 January it had agreed to pay about $25m to settle a lawsuit by Trump over the company’s suspension of his accounts after the 6 January 2021 attack at the US Capitol.\nParamount’s decision to settle the case – which has reportedly caused deep upset in the CBS newsroom – also follows ABC News agreeing to pay $15m to Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate comments by the anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found civilly liable for rape."

    "raw_text": "For the first four weeks of the 2025 Club World Cup, there had been the danger that the tournament would soon be largely forgotten. There is no danger of that after the final. There had been unease after the 2022 World Cup final at the way Qatar inserted itself into the trophy presentation by draping a bisht over Lionel Messi, but at least the Emir kept his distance. Donald Trump, by contrast, placed himself front and centre of the celebrations – and he was soon joined by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, who has a pathological fear of missing out, and must follow his great ally in all things.\nAnd so we were presented with a grimly perfect image of this misguided tournament, a celebrating football team struggling to be seen from behind the politicians who took centre stage. The confusion of Cole Palmer and Reece James at Trump’s continued presence was clear. History, and not just football history, will not forget such shameless grandstanding, or Fifa’s complicity in allowing football to be hijacked by a national leader.\nIt was a day the ramifications of which will be sifted for years. As a footballing spectacle, it was remarkable, a game in which Palmer produced a performance to elevate him to global stardom, in which Robert Sánchez did much to quiet his many critics, in which Enzo Maresca announced himself as a tactician of the highest rank.\nThere had been plenty of intrigue earlier in the tournament – Al-Hilal’s last-16 victory over Manchester City and Real Madrid’s capitulation in the semi-final perhaps most notably – but they had always been undercut by doubts as to how seriously each side was taking it. But PSG’s determination to add the world title to the Champions League crown they won in May was obvious and, in the final, they were outplayed to a startling degree.\nLuis Enrique’s side had essentially been untouchable since the turn of the year, not just winning games but looking sharper than opponents, on another tactical level. They had outclassed Madrid in the semi-final to the extent that the game was done within 20 minutes. Yet the final was lost by half-time as their left flank was repeatedly over-run. Khvicha Khvaratskelia, whose defensive work is usually so striking, didn’t make a single tackle or interception (PSG’s front three as a whole managed just one regain between them) and Fabián Ruiz was bypassed so that Nuno Mendes, who for a year has seemed obviously the best left-back in the world, was repeatedly exposed, sometimes to Malo Gusto but sometimes, more dangerously, to Palmer.\nPalmer produced one of the great final performances, scoring the first with a great finish, the second with a great finish after a dummied pass of almost comical effectiveness and then setting up the third with a barrelling run and perfectly calibrated pass for João Pedro. Perhaps PSG were disadvantaged by having played in the second semi-final; perhaps in the extreme heat an extra 24 hours of rest makes a huge difference. Still, it’s been a long time since anybody has taken Luis Enrique’s PSG apart like that – even if it took two exceptional saves from Sánchez to prevent PSG getting a second-half goal that might have made the denouement more anxious than it was.\nThere have been plenty who have doubted Maresca’s tactical approach, his apparent over-caution, his obsession with avoiding risk. But on Sunday, he clearly got the gameplan right. Using Pedro Neto as an auxiliary wing-back helped negate the forward surges of Achraf Hakimi but it was on the other flank, the way space was created for Palmer, that the game was won. These were moments that will define careers and, in so doing, offer legitimacy and prestige to the Club World Cup. As world champions, after a performance like that, with a squad of such depth, Chelsea have to be considered serious contenders for the Premier League title.\nBut in the end, the football seemed an afterthought. There is always something uncomfortable to the European mind in the militarism of US sporting fanfare (which has begun, regrettably, to seep into the FA Cup final). Why was the Star-Spangled Banner played before kick-off? When has the host’s anthem ever previously been played like that at a Fifa event? Why was there a fly-over of military planes?\nBy the trophy presentation, that had become something much more sinister.\nWas the US hosting football, or was football hosting the US? Or rather a particular vision of the US represented by Trump? Fifa has just opened offices in Trump Tower: Infantino’s alliance with the president is both committed and alarming. And having pushed through his vision of the Club World Cup with all its flaws without meaningful consultation, what next for Fifa? Checks and balances simply don’t apply any more.\n-\nThis is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond. Subscribe for free here.

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump once claimed he was courted by several major league baseball clubs in his youth but turned them down because they couldn’t offer him enough money. On Sunday, baseball got its revenge.\nThe President attended Game 5 of the World Series between the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros at Nationals Park, a short journey from the White House. When Trump was shown on the video screens in the stadium he was loudly booed by fans. That, perhaps, was predictable: Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and both Bushes were all booed while attending baseball games as President. What came shortly afterwards was a little more personal in a city that is heavily Democratic as cries of “Lock him up!” rang out, a reference to the chants about Hillary Clinton used at Trump’s rallies in the run-up to the 2016 presidential elections.\nFootage of the incident swept through Twitter, showing the moment that fans inside the stadium changed from cheering to booing.\nTrump left the game with one inning to go, although it was unclear whether he was unhappy with the reaction of the crowd, the fact that the Nationals were losing or just wanted to beat the traffic.\nEvery US president since 1910 has thrown out a ceremonial first-pitch at a baseball game during their time in office, but Trump is the first to break with that tradition. Major League Baseball’s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said the President had told him he did not want to participate in the ceremony at this year’s World Series “in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible”.\nOn Friday, Trump had joked his bullet-proof vest would make it hard to throw out the first pitch. “I don’t know. They gotta dress me up in a lot of heavy armour. I’ll look too heavy. I don’t like that,” he said.\nSunday’s first pitch was instead thrown by Washington DC chef José Andrés, a vocal critic of Trump. Andrés has regularly attacked Trump’s immigration policies and his administration’s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.\nTrump attended the game with his wife, Melania, and several Republican politicians including Lindsey Graham, Matt Gaetz and David Perdue.\nTrump, a first baseman, was a good baseball player in high school. In a 2014 interview at the Economic Club of Washington DC, he claimed: “You know I was recruited, and they all wanted me to go in Major League.”\nSunday’s game ended with a 7-1 victory for the Astros, and they now lead the best-of-seven series 3-2. Game 6 of the series is on Tuesday night in Houston."

    "raw_text": "Maggie O’Farrell’s lauded 2020 novel Hamnet is a dense and lyrical imagining of the lives of William Shakespeare’s family, full of interior thought and lush descriptions of the physical world. It would seem, upon reading, near impossible to adapt into a film. Or, at least, a film worthy of O’Farrell’s so finely woven sensory spell. Film-maker Chloé Zhao has attempted to do so anyway, and the result is a stately, occasionally lugubrious drama whose closing minutes are among the most poignant in recent memory.\nZhao is a good fit for the material. She, too, is a close observer of nature and of the many aching, yearning people passing through it. But she has previously not made anything as traditionally tailored and refined as this. The humbler dimensions of her films The Rider and Nomadland are missed here; Hamnet too often gives off the effortful hum of prestige awards-bait.\nBut Zhao’s hallmark compassion and curiosity remain, qualities necessary to Hamnet, which could easily tilt into the realm of manipulative tearjerkers. Hamnet was, records tell us, Shakespeare’s son, who died at a young age and is thought to have inspired, at the very least, the title of Hamlet, the story of a young prince who meets a tragic end. What O’Farrell and now Zhao imagine is that the writing of Hamlet was an exercise in grieving, a way for Shakespeare to honor his son and bid him adieu.\nIt’s a persuasive idea, even if it takes some literary contortions to really buy into it. While Zhao sometimes strains to sell the notion – a scene in which a weeping Shakespeare stands on the banks of the Thames and speaks a snippet of the “to be or not to be” soliloquy is perhaps a bit over-egged – she has mostly convinced us by the end. Or, at least, Hamnet has justified the bold speculation, using a leapt-to conclusion to illuminate a fundamental aspect of living. Ultimately, what does it really matter if it actually happened this way?\nHamnet invents many other facets of Shakespeare’s history. It dreams up the courtship of young William (Paul Mescal), then a Latin tutor, and slightly older Agnes Hathaway (Jessie Buckley), an oddball loner about whom the villagers whisper in fearful tones. William is drawn to exactly that strangeness, the individuality that will come to inform so much of the family’s domestic routine. Zhao spends a fair amount of time on these early days, maybe too much. Some of it could be better spent on the years in which Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe) occupied the house alongside his twin, Judith (Olivia Lynes), and their older sister, Susanna (Bodhi Rae Breathnach). One longs to truly know Hamnet before he is so wrenchingly lost to the world, to feel the agony of his absence that much more acutely.\nWhatever Zhao doesn’t supply, though, is mostly made up for by the richly felt performances of the film’s two leads. Mescal is able to be far more expressive than he’s been allowed in quieter films such as Aftersun and The History of Sound. It is a pleasure to see the full breadth of his range, from seductive to shattered. It’s Buckley, though, who wholly envelops the film, giving staggering breath and body to Hamnet’s portrait of loss. She is nothing short of a wonder. (She also recorded a new version of the audiobook and does a terrific job at that.) It is on her shoulders that the film’s knockout climax rests. As she rises to the task, it is as if she is no longer acting but instead channeling a whole history of human lamentation.\nThat may all sound rather grandiose. But the final five minutes of Hamnet really are that striking. So much much so that one can totally forgive the use of composer Max Richter’s On the Nature of Daylight, already used to embody grief over a child so effectively in the film Arrival. In these final moments, Zhao finally makes clear the whole purpose of the film. It has not been merely to show us a prettily shot sad thing, as the film can too often seem. It has, it turns out, been building toward a grand meditation on art’s great capacity. We watch in awe as something so personal to Agnes and her husband becomes, in a transformative instant, universal. It is the power of creation made manifest, a private sorrow blossoming into one of the most enduring works of art the world has ever known.\nThis sublime finale does not completely absolve the film of all of its problems. There is still its lopsided storytelling, still the persistent feeling that this is all strong-arming us into doleful submission, still the ever so slightly cloying quality of Agnes’s woodsy mysticism. But that Zhao manages even a few minutes of such transcendent catharsis may tip Hamnet into greatness anyway. In that closing, as Agnes both reaches for and says goodbye to the son who slipped away, the tears flow naturally, they need no effortful wringing out. It proves a lovely experience, to sob in a movie theater alongside strangers, mourning for Agnes and William’s loss and for our own, amazed and relieved that a faraway, unknowable person has made something to connect us all.\n-\nHamnet is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in the US on 27 November, in the UK on 9 January and in Australia on 15 January"

    "raw_text": "In 1596, William Shakespeare’s 11-year-old son Hamnet died in Stratford-upon-Avon. Four or so years later, Shakespeare wrote the play considered by many to be his greatest work, giving its tragic hero a variation of his dead son’s name. Almost four centuries later still, Maggie O’Farrell was studying Hamlet at school and learned of the boy Hamnet, whose life has been little more than a footnote in his father’s biography. The seed of curiosity planted 30 years ago has grown into her finest novel yet; a reimagining of Hamnet’s death and the long-lasting ripples it sent through his family.\nBut the title is slightly misleading. Though the novel opens with Hamnet, its central character and beating heart is the boy’s mother, whom O’Farrell calls Agnes. Names are significant in this book; when Agnes eventually sees the version of her son’s name on a London playbill, she feels he has been stolen from her a second time. Meanwhile, the most famous character in the novel goes unnamed; he is variously “her husband”, “the father”, “the Latin tutor”. He is allowed very little direct speech. This deliberate omission frees the narrative of all the freight of association that his name carries; even Stratford is rarely mentioned explicitly, with the author instead naming individual streets and houses to root her story in its location.\nAll this has the effect of focusing the attention on the everyday, domestic life of this family, who could be any family. Indeed, in their small local sphere it is Agnes who is the celebrity, known in the town for being unconventional, free-spirited, a gifted herbalist who trails rumours of other, stranger gifts. O’Farrell’s Agnes is a woman whose origins merge into a particularly English kind of folklore – “There used to be a story in these parts about a girl who lived at the edge of a forest” – harking back to a deep connection between humans and landscape, with echoes of tales such as Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\n“There were creatures in there who resembled humans – wood-dwellers, they were called – who walked and talked, but had never set foot outside the forest, had lived all their lives in its leafish light, its encircling branches, its wet and tangled interior.”\nAgnes herself is, in the eyes of her neighbours, a creature descended from myth; they regard her with a mixture of awe and wariness. When the young Latin tutor engaged to teach her half-brothers first spies her from the window of the schoolroom, striding out of the forest with a kestrel on her wrist, he thinks she is a boy. O’Farrell’s great skill throughout the book is to treat obviously “Shakespearean” themes, such as this kind of gender-blurring or the affinity between boy and girl twins, with subtlety, making them almost tangential when they occur in the playwright’s own life. Hamnet and his twin sister, Judith, have a trick they play on people: “to exchange places and clothes, leading people to believe that each was the other”.\nThis is not O’Farrell’s first foray into historical fiction – her 2006 novel The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox was set partly in the 1930s – but it is quite unlike anything she has written before. There is an elliptical, dreamlike quality to her prose in Hamnet that, though not obviously steeped in 16th-century language, is essential to creating a world that feels at once wholly tangible and somehow otherworldly, as if the membrane between the natural and supernatural was more porous then. The depth of her research is evident on every page. Anyone who has visited Shakespeare’s birthplace will recognise her descriptions of his former home, but O’Farrell plunges the reader into the vivid life of the house, with its smells of a glover’s workshop, the heat and bustle of a cookhouse, the physical effort of planting a garden or twisting out newly washed sheets.\nAt its heart, though, this is a book about grief, and the means by which people find their way through it. The scene in which Agnes washes and lays out the body of her dead son is devastating (he must be buried quickly, for fear the plague will spread – an aspect of the story that has gained accidental pertinence). There is great tenderness, too, in her reimagining of the relationship between Agnes and her husband, which endured such long absences. “It’s as if her mother needs London, and all that he does there, to rub off him before she can accept him back,” Judith observes.\nHamnet is evidence that there are always new stories to tell, even about the most well-known historical figures. It also confirms O’Farrell as an extraordinarily versatile writer, with a profound understanding of the most elemental human bonds – qualities also possessed by a certain former Latin tutor from Stratford.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Chinese-American director Chloé Zhao’s golden-hour-hued second feature sees the film-maker return to South Dakota’s Pine Ridge Indian reservation, where her 2015 debut, Songs My Brothers Taught Me, was set. Working with non-professional actors from the Pine Ridge community, Zhao tells the fictionalised true story of bareback bronc rider Brady Blackburn (played by real-life rodeo competitor Brady Jandreau). Brain and body both damaged in an accident, the local superstar is plagued with seizures that make it unsafe for him to do the one thing he’s good at. It’s jarring to see him with staples in the back of his head, stuck stacking shelves in the town’s supermarket.\nBrady gives up his horse (though not his saddle), turning his hand to training instead of riding. Zhao makes poetry of this loss. One mesmerising set piece sees him breaking in a baby bronc, communicating with the horse in a non-verbal dance of attention, patience and understanding. Though it’s filmed like a romance, the moment feels captured, not staged.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Chloé Zhao’s Nomadland is an utterly inspired docu-fictional hybrid, like her previous feature The Rider. It is a gentle, compassionate, questioning film about the American soul. With artistry and grace, Zhao folds nonprofessionals into an imagined story built around a cheerful, resourceful, middle-aged woman played by Frances McDormand. This quiet, self-effacing performance may be the best of her career so far.\nNomadland is about a new phenomenon: America’s 60- and 70-something generation whose economic future was shattered by the 2008 crash. They are grey-haired middle-class strivers reduced to poverty who can’t afford to retire but can’t afford to work while maintaining a home. So they have become nomads, a new American tribe roaming the country in camper vans in which they sleep, looking for seasonal work in bars, restaurants and – in this film – in a gigantic Amazon warehouse in Nevada, which takes the place of the agricultural work searched for by itinerant workers in stories such as The Grapes of Wrath. Zhao was even allowed to film inside one of Amazon’s eerie service-industry cathedrals.\nThe film shows you that, along with the hardship and the heartache, there is also serenity in this way of life, even a kind of euphoria – without the burdens of a house and possessions you can have a glorious and very American freedom in the lost tradition of Emerson and Twain. But what happens if your van – or your body – shows signs of collapse?\nThe movie is inspired by Jessica Bruder’s 2017 nonfiction book, Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century, and by the radical nomadist and anti-capitalist leader Bob Wells, who appears as himself and has a devastatingly moving speech at the end of the film.\nMcDormand stars as Fern, a widow and former substitute teacher in Empire, Nevada – a town wiped off the map by a factory closure – who is forced into piling some possessions into a tatty van and heading off, something she accepts with an absolute lack of self-pity. The people she meets on the road are, mostly, real nomads who have vivid presences on screen and McDormand’s modest, equable persona slots easily into this group. In some ways, her character functions as the film’s interviewer, or ambassador to the real world. Zhao and McDormand have to steer her fictional existence into their actual lives, and steer their lives into an imagined world. McDormand is a marvellous diplomat for this creative process. The other fictional character is a nice, if maladroit person, a fellow nomad-tramp (David Strathairn) who has a crush on Fern.\nSometimes Nomadland looks like a very, very sweet and positive version of Mad Max – a film about a postapocalyptic US where the people riding around in vans and trucks are just hippy-ish souls who only want to help each other. I spent a few anxious minutes here and there waiting for what I assumed would be the inevitable incursion by violent Hells Angels or sneery materialists, but it never happened. And in some ways this isn’t quite a postapocalypse: the nomads find work and their lives have a kind of purpose, even a nobility. Fern’s sister compares them to American pioneers. At times, the film looks like a tour of a deserted planet, especially when she heads out to the Badlands national park in South Dakota, where there is also tourist-trade work to be had. But the nomads are not alone. They have each other, and their relationship to the non-nomad world is far from hostile.\nZhao may well have drawn some inspiration from movies such as Barbara Loden’s Wanda (1970) or Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven (1978), with their hard-scrabble world. The important difference is that her movie is not directionally shaped by narrative – that is, a narrative towards disaster – in the usual way, although there are important plot developments concerning Fern’s relationship with her shy suitor. It is more of a group portrait and a portrait of the times, brought off with exceptional intelligence and style. Arguably it is not angry enough about the economic forces that are causing all this but it still looks superbly forthright. There is real greatness in Chloé Zhao’s film-making.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Henrik Ibsen’s second-most famous play, Hedda Gabler, has been plenty messed around with in recent years. There was a much-derided stage production starring Mary-Louise Parker. There was Liz Meriwether’s sci-fi reimagining, Heddatron. And now there is Nia DaCosta’s film Hedda, a rejiggering of the narrative that places a premium on subterfuge and sexual intrigue. It sometimes lands its intended jolt, but too often mistakes arch style for profundity.\nThat was also true of DaCosta’s Candyman sequel, an endlessly attractive film that was an otherwise confused update of the 1992 classic. Hedda fares better; it’s the work of a more assured and restrained writer-director, one who is willing to, on occasion, let visual flash take a backseat to more mechanical matters of storytelling. But there is nonetheless a recklessness to DaCosta’s version, its brash iconoclasm throws both baby and bathwater out of the manor-house window.\nThe action has been transposed from 19th-century Oslo to 1950s Great Britain, where former bohemian free-spirit Hedda (Tessa Thompson) has moved into a sprawling estate with her new husband, pinched and humorless academic George (Tom Bateman). They’ve decided to throw a party, ostensibly to celebrate the house and their return from a long honeymoon, but actually functioning as a way to secure George a crucial teaching position. DaCosta immediately foreshadows that the bash is going to end badly, sending Hedda stalking around the place with a wicked strut, pistol in hand. An old friend – really, an old lover – has just phoned to say she’ll stop by and Hedda seems both unnerved and invigorated by the news.\nWhat Hedda plans to do about the impending arrival of Eileen Lovborg (Nina Hoss) – who is an academic rival of George’s and a mostly out lesbian who refuses to acquiesce to social code in the way that Hedda is at least partially willing to – is, essentially, the mystery of DaCosta’s film. It’s a mousetrap sort of affair, a jury-rigged evening of cruel manipulation all serving Hedda’s grand design for self-preservation.\nWhich is certainly one facet of Ibsen’s play; Hedda has always been a bit cunning and ruthless, always steadfastly determined to keep herself in the finer things. But DaCosta turns her into a remorseless sociopath. She goes for bite and nastiness in the way of, say, Saltburn, badly boiling away the complexity of one of modern theater’s great characters.\nDaCosta takes some pains to tease out an idea of why Hedda has become this way: she is closeted and cosseted, she is Black in a largely white ecosystem, she not unjustifiably fears what may become of her should she lose her tenuous purchase on status. That argument is muddled, though. Race is glancingly mentioned but then never engaged with in a meaningful way. The film has more to say about sexuality, but depictions of queer repression’s dark consequence have been rendered more thoughtfully elsewhere. DaCosta fails to make a properly convincing case for her Hedda’s awful misdeeds.\nThompson tears into the role, plummy accent and all. Her line readings are alternately blithe and venomous, she casts sly and calculating looks across rooms, she coils around her prey with seductive menace. It’s fun to watch, but it’s also too grandly villainous. DaCosta sends Thompson tearing through the film without the guardrails of nuance or credible complication.\nThen Hoss storms across the film’s ballroom, dragging the tablecloth with her. Hoss’s performance is a marvel; so marvelous, in fact, that DaCosta can’t help but shift the whole focus of the film on to her. Here is the picture of patriarchy’s warping effect that the film wants to paint elsewhere, here is the worthy and compelling figure of feminist outrage and frustration. As the film follows Eileen (who is a man called Eilert in the original play) on her dismal downward spiral, it finally whips up an unignorable resonance. Hedda, meanwhile, is left to plot in the periphery, making her seem all the more psychotically vicious.\nThere is maybe indication in DaCosta’s script that said psychotic viciousness is, in fact, some sort of manic depression that has been plaguing poor Hedda. But making that diagnosis requires too much work on the audience’s part, and perhaps too much familiarity with the original text. Watched in a vacuum – which, ideally, adaptations should be able to withstand – DaCosta’s Hedda is an annihilating and ultimately empty portrait of one woman destroying another out of the most basic, boilerplate motivation.\nStill, there is the wonder of Hoss’s breakneck work, and the sensory pleasures of DaCosta’s design. She captures the film’s nightmare party in richly saturated color, drenched in the golden glow of practical lighting. DaCosta dexterously moves her camera between rooms, gliding through scenes with smooth, exciting momentum. It’s an impressive feat of technical film-making, which has now become a hallmark of DaCosta’s work. But she caves to baser impulses in reinterpreting an old and, some might say, crusty play. There is a better Hedda Gabler to be made in this modernist, eye-popping mode. It just shouldn’t be one that so readily cheapens a character who’s earned over a century of close and careful attention, for good reason.\n-\nHedda is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released in cinemas on 22 October and on Amazon on 29 October"

    "raw_text": "Charlotte Wells makes a rather amazing feature debut in the Critics Week sidebar of Cannes with Aftersun, starring Paul Mescal and nine-year-old newcomer Francesca Corio, about a divorced dad and his young daughter taking a low-key summer holiday in a budget Turkish resort, a sunshine break that is a kind of farewell.\nWells’s movie ripples and shimmers like a swimming pool of mystery; the way Wells captures mood and moment, never labouring the point or forcing the pace, reminded me of the young Lucrecia Martel. With remarkable confidence, she just lets her movie unspool naturally, like a haunting and deceptively simple short story. The details accumulate; the images reverberate; the unshowy gentleness of the central relationship inexorably deepens in importance.\nAftersun is about childhood memories being worn to a sheen by being constantly replayed in your mind, about the meanings that were not there then, but are there now, revealed or perhaps created by the remembering mind, and endowed with a new poignancy and grace.\nPaul Mescal is – as ever – excellent as Calum, a Scottish guy who has come on this package holiday trip with his kid Soph: a charming and unaffected performance from Corio. It is the 90s, so Calum keeps in touch with home via a payphone and Soph wonders that he still says “Love you” to her mum at the end of their overheard conversation even though they are divorced. Throughout most of the film nothing very dramatic happens, and even when something important does happen, it is coolly unemphasised: like a live feed from real life, or perhaps an unedited bit of the video that Calum and Soph are making with his brand-new DV Sony handycam.\nSoph and Calum have to share a double bed in their room because the travel agency messed up his request for twin singles. But it doesn’t matter; there is no atmosphere of imminent transgression or doom or emotional upset. They get on with their holiday cheerfully enough: going to the pool, hanging out, doing karaoke (Soph has to do it on her own because her dad won’t join in), doing day trips to cultural points of interest, taking the mickey out of the reps. Soph befriends a boy her age that plays on the motorbike game next to her in the resort’s video arcade. Calum embarrasses her terribly with his dance moves at the resort disco and his love of Tai Chi. And when Calum is content to read on his own, Soph gets to hang out with older teen kids because she turns out to be really good at pool, and they introduce her into the adult art of gossip. But one night Calum goes off on his own and gets drunk, overwhelmed with a sadness he can’t show her, and then overwhelmed with guilt at how he neglected Soph.\nAs for Corio, she isn’t doing Tatum O’Neal-style precocity or acting; she just good-naturedly responds to Mescal’s amiably laidback teasing or chat, without ever being annoying or cute. Their rapport is a marvel, as is the way they have been directed by Wells.\nAnd all this is structured in terms of flashback via Soph’s adult self with great flair, quite unlike the normal way this framing device is managed. Calum’s final walk away from Soph in her memory, down an airport corridor that appears surreally to lead to a nightclub, is a wonderful touch. What a pleasure.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Oliver Hermanus’s The History of Sound has admirers in Cannes; but I couldn’t help finding it an anaemic, laborious, achingly tasteful film, originally a short story by Ben Shattuck which has become a quasi-Brokeback Mountain film whose tone is one of persistent mournful awe at its own sadness.\nHermanus has made great movies in the past including Beauty and Living but this is a film that is almost petrified by its own upmarket values, paralysed under the varnish of classiness.\nIt’s about two young men in early 20th-century America, a singer and an academic musicologist, who meet at Boston music conservatory just before the US entry into the first world war, and then in the summer of 1920 they hike around the hills and backwoods of rural Maine, meeting local people and recording their authentic folk songs on wax cylinders, sleeping under the stars and falling in love. And when fate parts them in the years after, their love story becomes something more poignant.\nThey are farm-boy Lionel from Kentucky, played by Paul Mescal – a sonorous, stately voiceover at the very beginning reveals him to have perfect pitch and synaesthesia, the ability to comprehend music in taste and colour as well as sound – but these abilities are not actually revealed in the film.\nThe other man is David, played by Josh O’Connor, a man from a more privileged background, without Lionel’s instinctive music talent and destined for a college instructor’s job.\nMescal and O’Connor are of course very talented actors and they never do anything other than an impeccable professional job but they have each shown more passion in, variously, Andrew Haigh’s All of Us Strangers and Francis Lee’s God’s Own Country.\nThis is a film about music as well as love, but the folk songs, for which Mescal and O’Connor gamely fabricate enthusiasm, sound like museum pieces kept under glass and the love story itself feels as if it is kept under glass. The accents and line-readings feel like painstaking expert reconstructions rather than the real thing and the love scenes are at half-throttle – as if they are there to be remembered sadly rather than experienced ecstatically in the here and now.\nThere are, I concede, well-judged moments of tenderness and loneliness in the long aftermath to the long goodbye – in Lionel’s lonely wanderings in Italy and England, and in the revelation involved in his meeting with the woman that David married after their idyllic Maine summer. And there is to be a kind of final meeting between the two, involving that wax cylinder technology, perhaps inspired by a famous ending by Graham Greene.\nEverything here is out of the top drawer of production value: but it never really comes to passionate life."

    "raw_text": "Poking fun at the absurdity of celebrity is of course never unwarranted but it also frequently comes across as a little fatiguing. The target is easier than ever and too often, so are the jokes, incisive satire proving hard to nail when the subjects have become so indistinguishably cartoonish. The same has become true of the wealthy in general and recent films that have tried to lampoon either have felt lazy, pointing and laughing at something that’s stopped being funny a long time ago.\nThere’s an initial kick then to the new film from the French music video provocateur turned film-maker Romain Gavras, who finds a more precise section of the VIP area to ridicule: performative environmentalists. As the world continues to burn, artists and those who use that word loosely, have attached themselves to the crisis whether it be to make themselves seem worthier to their fanbase or to make terrible art in its name. There’s both here in Sacrifice, a biting comedy thriller that lands us at another meaningless gala, set inside a remote location in Greece. We arrive with troubled movie star Mike (Chris Evans), panicking over his perceived hair loss (his assistant, played by Sam Richardson, assures him that another trip to Turkey is easily scheduled) and eager to move past a rather embarrassing viral clip of him ranting with a flame-thrower at the premiere of his action vehicle Octavius: The Last Centurion. He’s technically there to do good for the environment but he’s really just there to do good for his image, something that suffers a setback when he sees Bezos-styled billionaire Ben (Vincent Cassel) showing a Daily Mail TikTok of his freakout to others. Ben’s wife Gloria (Salma Hayek) is a pop star whose latest album is designed to be from the perspective of a flood.\nAfter Ben announces a new mining scheme that he claims will actually help the ocean (!), Mike takes the stage for another rant, turning himself into an internet joke once again. But things are about to get a lot worse as a group of cultish eco-terrorists (dubbed “Green Isis” on the ground) take the event hostage, pausing a dance performance designed to help save the environment (featuring Charli xcx in a cameo as Mother Nature). They are led by Joan (Anya Taylor-Joy) who announces that the world is days from extinction and to prevent a volcano from erupting, they must throw some celebrities in it.\nIt’s the kind of set-up one might expect from Ruben Östlund and Taylor-Joy herself starred in the adjacent eat-the-rich foodie satire The Menu but Gavras, and co-writer Will Arbery, known for Succession, find their own spark in the witty and well-observed first act. Their jabs are obvious but amusing and there’s something recognisably nauseating about the self-importance of hearing a certain brand of modern celebrity convinced their work will somehow contribute to global betterment. But as we leave the event, as the quest truly begins, Gavras starts to lose his grasp, less confident when tackling a world outside the poppy excess he’s come to know (and sometimes hate) so well. The larking around starts to turn more serious but the film can’t quite decide just how seriously we should be taking it and debates over proven science v fixed beliefs go from circular and repetitive to genuinely baffling when a last act John Malkovich appears.\nWhat keeps us glued throughout is Evans, who gives an unusually top-tier performance, finding space to make his spiralling actor both pathetically funny and affectingly human. It’s the kind of film one can imagine Evans taking on back when he was still taking chances and before he was completely subsumed within the Marvel universe. He’s technically out now but he’s not really found much of a groove since, getting involved with some of the shoddiest streaming projects of the last few years (Ghosted, Red One, The Gray Man, Pain Hustlers), bad films that he’s also been bad in, adding a worrying question mark to his star status. Gavras has given him perhaps his greatest role to date here and he runs with it. Cassel has far less to do but has fun ragging on him (“I can’t believe I’m going to die next to a Golden Globe loser”) and there’s a wordless yet utterly transfixing performance from Jade Croot, who was similarly chilling in this year’s Sundance horror Rabbit Trap.\nThey make for a fine cast (Hayek is underused yet in small moments provides a reminder of just how great she can be at comedy) but Gavras leaves them and us stranded on the way to his out-there ending. Even before we’re looking into a volcano, Sacrifice has fallen over the edge.\n-\nSacrifice is screening at the Toronto film festival and is seeking distribution"

    "raw_text": "Denis Villeneuve’s sci-fi contact drama is dreamy, freaky, audacious. It skirts the edge of absurdity, as anything like this must, but manages to keep clear, and it includes a big flourish in the manner of early films by M Night Shyamalan, which adroitly finesses the narrative issue of what exactly to do with a movie about aliens showing up on Earth.\nI have been agnostic about this kind of movie recently, after the overwrought disappointments of Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar and Jeff Nichols’s Midnight Special. But Villeneuve’s Arrival is both heartfelt and very entertaining.\nAs is now expected with this kind of film, the protagonist is a flustered, bewildered civilian with special expertise, brusquely pressed into service by the military, which has got the spacecraft surrounded in the short term.\nAmy Adams is Dr Louise Banks, a professor of comparative linguistics with nothing and no one in her life but her work. But as it happens, Dr Banks was once seconded as a military adviser to translate a video of insurgents speaking Farsi. So when a dozen giant spaceships land in 12 different locations on Earth (including Devon – sadly there no scenes there), each looking like a bisected rugby ball standing on end, a bunch of army guys led by Col Weber (Forest Whitaker) show up on Louise’s doorstep, demanding she come with them to help translate what the aliens are saying. Why, you ask, did they not approach Noam Chomsky, with his understanding of “deep structure” in language? Perhaps Prof Chomsky did not care to help America’s military-intelligence complex.\nAt any rate, Louise’s liaison is the flirtatious Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), a military scientist who, in a stereotypical and fallacious way, equates his masculinity with science and affects to despise what he sees as the softer discipline of linguistics. Michael Stuhlbarg plays Halpern, the glowering CIA chief. But unbeknown to them, there is a secret tragedy in Louise’s life: a lost child, dead of cancer in her late teens. Her attempts to communicate with the aliens cause painful but illuminating echoes in her mind.\nIf a lion could speak, said Wittgenstein, we would not understand him. Does the same go for aliens? Spielberg solved this issue elegantly in Close Encounters of the Third Kind by making the form of communication a five-note musical phrase, ending questioningly on the dominant. Villeneuve’s solution is more literal. The aliens have a code which – a little preposterously – Louise finds herself more or less able to crack, with the crowdsourced expertise of the other 11 human-contact teams around the globe. But it is her human intuition, vulnerability and spontaneity that finally enable her to reach out to the visitors.\nInevitably, these “contact” moments are where the film’s real impact and atmosphere have to be. And Villeneuve doesn’t disappoint in sequences of eerie and claustrophobic strangeness – though I concede the film is most effective before the physical form of the aliens is revealed. There are also touches of comedy: Ian and Louise decide, for convenience’s sake, to nickname two aliens Abbott and Costello – maybe in homage to the linguistic misunderstanding in the duo’s famous routine about a baseball team’s positions.\nBy coolly switching focus to political intrigue and betrayal within the human ranks, Villeneuve keeps a grip on his story and creates ballast for its departure into the realms of the visionary and supernatural. And he also prepares us for the film’s sense that language itself, freed of our usual sense of its linear form, might be more important than anyone thought. (I wonder if Villeneuve has seen the 2010 documentary Into Eternity, by Danish film-maker Michael Madsen, about attempts to devise a new universal language to label underground repositories of nuclear waste – labels whose warnings have to be understood by future humans whose language has evolved away from what we know now.)\nArrival is a big, risky, showy movie which jumps up on its high-concept highwire and disdains a net. And yes, there are moments of silliness when it wobbles a little, but it provides you with spectacle and fervent romance.\n- This article was corrected on 7 November 2016. An earlier version said Abbott and Costello’s famous routine was about a baseball batting order. It was about a fielding team’s positions.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Ever since I discovered the mating dynamics of the deep-sea anglerfish, where the male fuses with the female, and how closely this mirrors some disturbing human relationship patterns, I have been chewing over the idea that everything that exists in our unconscious also exists in the ocean. From the methodical violence of sharks, to dolphins who mourn their dead and jellyfish whose pulsating contractions remind me of my labour, the only phenomenon on Earth that is as rich and colourful and dark and fascinating as the deep sea is the deep unconscious.\nMy problem, as I realised in a session not long ago with my psychoanalyst, is that I have been swimming in shallow waters. This is something I have seen many times in myself, and perhaps these moments of recognition help me to see it in my patients – the unconscious pull to stay in the emotional shallows, not to delve deeper into your own internal experience and understand the more profound wishes and hungers that drive us. Instead, we scroll away our difficult feelings, staring at whatever screen is in front of us rather than looking inwards. We cheapen our relationships with others, craving and offering a particular kind of emotional stroking that keeps things at surface level. We buy things, we watch things, we listen to things, we squeeze things, we try things on and send things back, and we do, do, do – we do to stay in the shallows, so we don’t have to be in the depths.\nBut we know the way to a better life sits below the surface, not on it. I recently read the brilliant How to Speak Whale by Tom Mustill, who writes about the Dutch microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. In the mid-17th century, Leeuwenhoek developed magnification technology comparable to modern light microscopes, which exposed the truth of the extraordinary life teeming within a “thimbleful of water from a local lake”. Mustill offers us Leeuwenhoek’s wonderful quote: “No more pleasant sight has yet met my eye than this of so many thousands of living creatures in one small drop of water, all huddling and moving.”\nIt made me think again of our unconscious; the extraordinary depth of meaning hiding within one slip of the tongue, one image in a dream. A patient can seem to be having a lovely time in their session, and a single blink-and-you’ll-miss-it half-glance towards the door can reveal they’re absolutely desperate to get out; their politeness hiding the painful emotions that they didn’t realise they were so desperate to run away from.\nIf I draw their attention towards that glance, towards their true feelings, it offers them the opportunity to realise that this is what has actually kept them running around in circles, stuck exactly where they have always been. This can then be the doorway – if they choose to walk through it – to a better life.\nThese unfelt, unconscious emotions, whatever they might be – pain, rage, envy, hatred, love, guilt, shame – are like the powerful creatures living deep in the sea. Both are capable of incredible force: the energy that comes from immense weight and propulsion. To bring these feelings and dynamics into consciousness is what it means to me to swim in deeper waters; to live more truly, with more weight and more propulsion, with a particular kind of energy, building a life that is truly meaningful.\nMustill’s book tells the powerful story of how, in the 20th century, whales were hunted and feared, valued by humans only for what their butchered body parts could be sold for, and destroyed to near-extinction by the end of the 1960s. It was Dr Roger Payne who was determined to save them by helping people to understand the intrinsic worth of these creatures through the beauty of their song. Released in 1970, his album of recordings, Songs of the Humpback Whale, went multi-platinum, and became the soundtrack to the protest movement that ultimately resulted in the 1982 adoption of a moratorium on commercial whaling by the International Whaling Commission. Estimates suggest that in the 19th century, humans killed about 3 million whales; today, many populations are “rebounding and expanding”, Mustill writes. “This is a counterpoint to the dangerous narrative of innate human destructiveness, which leads to apathy. It shows how we can change, and life can recover.”\nI see this as a therapist in my consulting room most days, and I occasionally get a taste of it as a patient myself. Our capacity to destroy sits alongside our creative power to repair and recover. When therapy is useful, and a patient can grow the capacity to allow their true feelings into their minds, this can spark a new thought, often one that links their past with their present, that illuminates how something got stuck along the way. This can light the way out of apathy to new life. We can unstick, we can change. We can make things better for ourselves, for the natural world, and the generations to come. But just like Leeuwenhoek with his magnifying glass, we have to go deep.\nMoya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author of When I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of Adulthood\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "raw_text": "I have just discovered how the deep-sea anglerfish mates. My apologies if this is old ichthyological news to you, but it is new news to me, and it is very definitely going to be the hook for this week’s column.\nThe female deep-sea anglerfish is very large compared with the male deep-sea anglerfish. In some species, he sniffs her out (using his giant nostrils) and upon finding his mate, he bites into her, his teeth and lips then dissolving into her flesh. His little fishy body dangling off hers like a limp appendage, he loses himself utterly, including the use of his eyes – what is the point of them, when he has hers? Some males “become little more than blobs or skin tags”, says James Maclaine, senior curator of fish at the Natural History Museum. The two fuse together so completely as to become one physiological entity, with one combined bloodstream, living one life and, eventually, dying one death.\nI mention this because I do not think it only applies to deep-sea anglerfish. There is a particular way of being in a relationship in which two people allow themselves to be – perhaps crave being, as well as fear being – totally fused together, losing their own sense of identity completely, so that they are no longer two separate individuals together but one seamless entity. Not seeing with two sets of eyes, but with one. In fact, I think it is quite common.\nThis does not happen as dramatically in humans as it does with anglerfish. There is no permanent physical fusing, of course – it is all taking place in a psychological dimension, deep in the unconscious, so it can be more subtle to spot.\nBut we all know when we lose a friend to a relationship like this; when we watch the vibrant, independent person we cherished disappear, as they seem to forget about their own needs and wants and friendships, conforming to a new sense of identity inside someone else. It can be less easy to spot when it is happening to you.\nOne sign you might be caught up in a relationship, or indeed a friendship, with tendencies like this is if you find yourself in absolute fury when your “other half” deviates from a particular script you didn’t even realise you had in mind for them. For example, they have a desire to do something different from what you want them to do, or they feel differently about a political issue from how you want them to feel, or their idea of a good holiday is different from your idea of a good holiday, and they do not immediately comply with your wishes. In other words, they are acting as their own, separate person.\nOne of my friends, who recognised the universality in this description of the deep-sea anglerfish, asked me: “What is the alternative? What is a healthy fish pairing? I bet salmon don’t do this.”\nThe problem is, I think, that we don’t see this way of relating as an unhealthy pairing; in fact, we idealise it. This is how we romanticise falling in love. My other half. I’m yours. You complete me. Two become one. We don’t want to be salmon; a part of us unconsciously longs for this kind of merging. This makes sense. Every single one of us begins our existence in this state of non-separate fusion, of total enmeshment, within our mother’s body, receiving nourishment from her placenta, taking the oxygen we need from her blood through the umbilical cord – though, unlike the anglerfish, we never share a bloodstream. Our minds are folded up together in a state of apparently perpetual oneness.\nA part of us, I think, is always longing to go back to this, a way of being where needs are met before they can even become needs, so we do not have to experience the vulnerability and difference and aloneness necessary to recognise we are receiving something from somebody else. Where there is no hunger, no cold, no hard edges, nothing asked of us and nothing to ask for. The immersive sense of timelessness and boundlessness some seek in heroin, or gambling, or video games, or social media.\nMaybe all of us, deep down, want to find someone who loves us unconditionally, as if we are a part of them. But to build better relationships, to build a better life, you have to do it as a separate person. Being a separate person, and tolerating your partner being a separate person, is hard. It is painful. It is a feat of psychological growth. It involves taking responsibility for your own life but also understanding how that life is inevitably shaped by people outside your control. That they too are responsible for their own lives. It involves accepting that there are things that only you can offer yourself – like emotional freedom, personal fulfilment, self-acceptance. And understanding that there are things that only your partner can offer you if they so choose – like their thoughts, their body, their love.\nIt is hard. It is painful. But it is important. Because otherwise you might wake up one morning and realise that you have lost the use of your own eyes, and that you have been seeing the world through someone else’s. That although – unless you are particularly unlucky – your lips and teeth have not fused irretrievably with your lover’s body, you have nevertheless become a limp appendage to another person’s life.\nMoya Sarner is an NHS psychotherapist and the author of When I Grow Up – Conversations With Adults in Search of Adulthood"

    "raw_text": "House Democrats on Monday released an image of a sexually suggestive letter and drawing that appears to bear the signature of Donald Trump, the very same note the president had denied writing after reports of its existence were published earlier this year in the Wall Street Journal.\nThe letter, which was turned over by lawyers for disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s estate in response to a subpoena from the House oversight committee, was included in a set of notes sent to the convicted sex offender for his 50th birthday.\nThe image showed a letter that in effect comported with a description in the Journal’s report from July. Inside the sketch of a woman’s torso, the note depicts an imagined conversation between Trump and Epstein, with what appeared to be Trump’s signature below.\n“The oversight committee has secured the infamous ‘Birthday Book’ that contains a note from President Trump that he has said does not exist,” Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel, said in a statement. “It’s time for the president to tell us the truth about what he knew and release all the Epstein files.”\nThe White House did not immediately comment on the letter, but officials sought to discredit the note. Deputy chief of staff for communications, Taylor Budowich, suggested in an X post carrying a different version of Trump’s signature that the letter or the signature had been falsified.\n“Time for news corp to open that check book, it’s not his signature. DEFAMATION!” Budowich wrote, referencing the defamation suit that Trump filed against News Corp, the parent company of the Journal, over its original story.\nBut even though Trump more recently has signed both his first and last name together, for years, he used only his first name in signatures, stylized with a line extending from the last letter – and Trump’s signature on a letter from 1995 closely resembled the one found on the note to Epstein.\nTrump has separately denied drawing the figure or writing the note to Epstein. “The supposed letter they printed by President Trump to Epstein was a FAKE,” he said in July.\nThe letter from the so-called birthday book was turned over to the House oversight committee in response to a subpoena issued by its Republican chairperson James Comer, and a 25 July letter from Democrats Sylvia Garcia and Ro Khanna urging Epstein’s estate to produce the materials.\nThe committee later also released the entirety of the birthday book, which scanned pages showed was titled “The First Fifty Years” and was split into 10 sections including a prologue written by Epstein’s associate Ghislane Maxwell.\nThe leather-bound volume contained dozens of letters and images that were of a sexually explicit nature, ranging from drawings by “girlfriends” of Epstein receiving massages next to a pool, to photos of lions and zebras engaged in sex.\nOther contributors included Bill Clinton, the billionaire Leon Black, Harvard law school professor and onetime Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz, the now British ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson and Les Wexner, among others.\nTrump vehemently denied having written or illustrated the note, dismissing it as “a fake thing” and insisting “these are not my words, not the way I talk”.\nHe later filed the defamation suit against the Journal’s reporters, publisher Dow Jones and News Corp. In response, a Dow Jones spokeswoman said: “We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting.” The lawsuit sought $10bn in damages and specifically named media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has spent months shifting its position on whether Epstein-related files would be released or even if they existed at all, with Trump at one point calling them a “Democrat hoax”.\nThe House oversight committee, with participation from Democrats and Republicans, continues to review Epstein-related records. Epstein, a wealthy financier with numerous powerful connections, died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges."

    "raw_text": "House oversight committee releases image of entire Epstein birthday album, with letter attributed to Trump\nThe Republican-led House oversight committee has released digital images of the entire birthday album presented to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003, making them available for download. The images include a sexually suggestive drawing and letter bearing the name of Donald Trump.\nIn a statement, the Republican chair of the committee, congressman James Comer of Kentucky, also scolded House Democrats for “cherry-picking documents and politicizing information received from the Epstein Estate today”.\nDemocrats on the committee posted an image of the letter attributed to Trump on social media, and of another letter that refers to the current president.\nThe second letter released by the Democrats was from Joel Pashcow, a member of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, who made a crude joke about a woman the Wall Street Journal reports “Epstein and Trump each courted in the 1990s, according to court testimony and people familiar with the matter.”\nPashcow’s birthday letter included a photo of Epstein holding a giant, mock novelty check for $22,500, made to look like a payment from Trump to Epstein. The photo was captioned: “Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells ‘fully depreciated’ [woman’s name] to Donald Trump for $22,500. Showed early ‘people skills’ too. Even though I handled the deal I didn’t get any of the money for the girl!”\nThe woman’s name was redacted in the image of the book provided to the House by the estate of Jeffrey Epstein.\nAs Leland Nally reported for Mother Jones in 2020, Pashcow’s name and phone number was in a leaked copy of what was said to be Epstein’s personal contact book that was posted online.\nThis brings our live coverage of the second Trump administration to a close for the day. We will return on Tuesday, but in the meantime, here are the latest developments:\nHouse Democrats and the Wall Street Journal published an image of the 2003 birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender, bearing the name of Donald Trump.\nThe Republican-led House oversight committee later released the entire birthday album, which was reportedly compiled for Epstein by his former girlfriend, and accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe White House press office claimed that Trump’s signature, using examples from 2024, is different from the signature on the 2003 letter, but signatures change with age, and other examples from the period, published by the Wall Street Journal, seem to match the signature on the letter to Epstein.\nMary Trump, the president’s niece and fierce critic of her uncle, wrote: “That’s definitely his signature. Just saying.”\nJD Vance, the vice-president who had previously suggested that the letter might not exist, dismissed the new evidence and accused Democrats of smearing Trump.\nAnother letter in the birthday album mentioned Trump. It was from Joel Pashcow, a member of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, who made a crude joke about brokering the sale of a woman by Epstein to Trump for $22,500.\nThe US supreme court overruled a lower court to allow federal immigration agents to proceed with raids in southern California targeting people for possible deportation based on their race or the language they speak.\nThe supreme court also allowed Trump to fire a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, blocking a lower court ruling to reinstate Rebecca Slaughter while the case plays out.\nWhile there is no evidence yet of the promised Apocalypse Now style assault on Chicago by the president’s “Department of War”, a Fox News reporter announced on Monday that “the surge has begun”.\nIn a segment that was promoted on social media by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the Fox correspondent, Griff Jenkins, reported that while he was embedded with immigration officers, “we arrested” one man suspected of being an undocumented immigrant.\nA Florida state appeals court judge who was nominated by Donald Trump to serve as a federal judge after the jurist ruled in favor of allowing Trump’s defamation lawsuit against the Pulitzer prize board to move forward was confirmed along party lines by the US Senate on Monday.\nThe Republican-led Senate voted 50-43 to confirm the Florida state judge, Ed Artau, to a seat on the US district court for the southern district of Florida.\nMoments before the vote, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, denounced the nomination on the Senate floor, saying:\nMr Artau’s nomination is a textbook example of quid pro quo if there ever was one.\nListen to this: while Mr Artau was actively lobbying the White House for a federal judgeship in the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election last year, while he was begging Donald Trump for a nomination to the bench, while he was meeting with Republican senators to angle for their recommendation, he was at the same time part of a panel of Florida state judges hearing Donald Trump’s defamation case against the Pulitzer Prize Board earlier this February.\nDid Mr Artau do the right thing and recuse himself from the case? Of course not.\nDid he inform anyone about this potential conflict of interest? Of course not.\nInstead, Mr Artau stayed on the case and – surprise, surprise – ruled in favor of Donald Trump.\nThat is no coincidence. That is no accident. That is Donald Trump rigging our courts with his loyalists.\nSome Trump critics suggest drawing for Epstein looks less like a woman than a girl\nAfter House Democrats released an image of a 2003 birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein bearing Donald Trump’s name, several Trump critics suggested that the drawing that frames the text looks less like what the Wall Street Journal called “the outline of a naked woman” than the outline of a girl.\nFaine Greenwood, a researcher who studies the use of drones in conflict, wrote on Bluesky: “this is actually worse than i imagined it was going to be because this does not look like a drawing of an adult woman, it looks like a drawing of a young girl”.\n“This does not look like the body of a grown woman,” the TikTok influencer Suzanne Lambert said. “This looks like the body of a young girl.”\n“Just look at it,” Julia Davis an expert on Russia media wrote. “Was he drawing a girl or a woman?”\nThe distinction matters, given that Epstein was later accused of abusing hundreds of girls during the decade before his 50th birthday, and that Trump had suggested in a 2002 interview with New York magazine that he was aware that the financier was attracted to young women.\n“I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,” Trump told the magazine, three years before a 14-year-old girl’s parents told Palm Beach police Epstein had paid their daughter for a massage.\n“He’s a lot of fun to be with,” the future president added. “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”\nHouse oversight committee releases image of entire Epstein birthday album, with letter attributed to Trump\nThe Republican-led House oversight committee has released digital images of the entire birthday album presented to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003, making them available for download. The images include a sexually suggestive drawing and letter bearing the name of Donald Trump.\nIn a statement, the Republican chair of the committee, congressman James Comer of Kentucky, also scolded House Democrats for “cherry-picking documents and politicizing information received from the Epstein Estate today”.\nDemocrats on the committee posted an image of the letter attributed to Trump on social media, and of another letter that refers to the current president.\nThe second letter released by the Democrats was from Joel Pashcow, a member of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club, who made a crude joke about a woman the Wall Street Journal reports “Epstein and Trump each courted in the 1990s, according to court testimony and people familiar with the matter.”\nPashcow’s birthday letter included a photo of Epstein holding a giant, mock novelty check for $22,500, made to look like a payment from Trump to Epstein. The photo was captioned: “Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells ‘fully depreciated’ [woman’s name] to Donald Trump for $22,500. Showed early ‘people skills’ too. Even though I handled the deal I didn’t get any of the money for the girl!”\nThe woman’s name was redacted in the image of the book provided to the House by the estate of Jeffrey Epstein.\nAs Leland Nally reported for Mother Jones in 2020, Pashcow’s name and phone number was in a leaked copy of what was said to be Epstein’s personal contact book that was posted online.\nVance, who previously asked to see the Epstein letter, now calls it 'BS'\nThe vice-president, JD Vance, who is one of the administration’s most dedicated social media posters, has weighed in on X to accuse Democrats of hypocrisy after they released an image of a sexually suggestive 2003 birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender, with what looks like Donald Trump’s signature.\n“The Democrats don’t care about Epstein. They don’t even care about his victims,” Vance wrote. “That’s why they were silent about it for years. The only thing they care about is concocting another fake scandal like Russiagate to smear President Trump with lies. No one is falling for this BS.”\nIn July, when the existence of the letter was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, Vance had demanded to see the letter and suggested that it was suspicious that the paper had not shown the White House a copy.\n“Forgive my language but this story is complete and utter bullshit. The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it?” Vance wrote at the time.\nIn reference to the text of the letter, which begins with an imagined dialogue between Trump and Epstein, Vance asked: “Does anyone honestly believe this sounds like Donald Trump?”\nWhile the literary device and the formal language used in the dialogue does not sound at all like the way that Trump speaks in public, it is an open secret that he has worked with ghostwriters throughout his career, so it is certainly possible that the letter was commissioned by Trump, but composed by someone else.\nIn 2000, for instance, when Trump flirted with the possibility of running for the presidential nomination of Ross Perot’s Reform party, Trump published a book of his policy ideas that was actually written by Dave Shiflett, a journalist.\nSince that book was published just three years before the Epstein birthday letter, the Guardian contacted Shiflett to ask if it might have been written for Trump by someone else.\n“My understanding is that Trump neither writes nor reads his books,” Shiflett wrote back. “Several years back a Washington Post reporter told me he had asked Trump about his books and he had said he never read them.”\n'That's definitely his signature,' Trump's niece says of birthday letter to Epstein\nMary Trump, the president’s niece who is a fierce critic of her uncle, has weighed in on the image of the signed birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender, bearing Donald Trump’s name.\n“That’s definitely his signature,” the president’s estranged niece wrote on X. “Just saying.”\nAnother former member of Trump’s inner circle who has turned critic, George Conway, pointed to a Wall Street Journal visual analysis, which compared the signature “Donald” on the sexually suggestive wishes to Epstein on his 50th birthday in 2003 to that on two letters signed by Trump in the same period.\nOne of those letters was to thank Conway, in 2006. The other was Trump’s remarkably warm letter of congratulations, in 2000, to Hillary Clinton on her victory in the race to represent New York in the senate that year.\nThe effusive letter to Clinton congratulated her on a “well-deserved victory” and had the words “great going!” written by hand and underlined twice in black marker next to the signature.\nThe Journal’s analysis of the letter also points to other reasons to doubt Trump’s denial when first confronted by the letter. “I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women”, Trump told the newspaper. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”\nAs the Journal shows, however, Trump did line drawings in a similar style, in a similar black marker, at about that time. He also used the word “enigma”, which is central to the letter, in two of his books; and has frequently used the phrase “a wonderful thing”, which also appears in the note, in public remarks.\nSeveral speakers at the immigrants rights news conference in Westlake quoted from Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent.\n“I dissent. We all dissent,” the mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, said.\nBass called the ruling “enraging” and said she had already directed the city to strengthen protocols prohibiting resources from assisting with federal immigration enforcement.\n“We will not and we will not participate in these cruel, inhumane tactics,” Bass said.\nShe warned that undermining the personal liberties of Angelenos would impact all Americans.\n“The rule of law used to mean something not just to us, but to the supreme court, but now, with the stroke of a pen, the supreme court has undermined the rights of millions,” she said.\nShe added: “And how ironic is it that this same supreme court that ruled colleges cannot use race in the admissions process has now ruled that law enforcement can use race to conduct raids and detain people.”\nAnother speaker, representing the ACLU, also quoted a part Sotomayor’s dissent that stated the situation in stark terms: “We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”\nOutside a Home Depot in a heavily Latino neighborhood of Los Angeles, immigrant-rights advocates, joined by the city’s mayor, Karen Bass, warned that the supreme court had “effectively legalized racial profiling”.\nCars honked in support as they passed signs that said “Keep Ice out of LA” and one that read simply: “Fuck Trump.”\n“We are infuriated because the impacts will continue to show in our community,” Flor Melendez, the executive director of CLEAN Car Wash Worker Center and a plaintiff in the case. “We will continue to feel the pressure, because we could not depend on our legal system.”\nShe said 81 car washes across the region have been raided since Trump’s crackdown began earlier this summer, some multiple times. At least 247 car wash workers were detained, she added.\n“The supreme court of the United States decided not to see this evil that has been visited on our people, not to hear the cries of all who have been victims and witnesses of these actions, and not to use the voice of the court to protect individual rights under the Constitution,” said Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (Chirla), which was one of the organizational plaintiffs in this case.\n“Do the conservative justices not have eyes to see the video evidence, or are they not able to read our multiple collected declarations that we have provided,” Salas added. “Our evidence demonstrated that these are not calm and consensual engagements with individuals who voluntarily offer information about their immigration status.”\nWhite House claims image of Epstein birthday note 'proves' Trump did not draw or sign it\nThe White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, insists that a photograph of a sexually suggestive 2003 birthday note to Jeffrey Epstein, bearing Donald Trump’s name and signature, released by House Democrats and published by the Wall Street Journal on Monday, is evidence that the president has been framed.\n“The latest piece published by the Wall Street Journal PROVES this entire ‘Birthday Card’ story is false”, Leavitt wrote on X. “As I have said all along, it’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it.”\nThe president’s spokesperson added that his legal team “will continue to aggressively pursue litigation”, against the Journal, which first reported the existence of the note and drawing.\nLeavitt also referred to the reporting that Trump contributed the signed drawing and note to a birthday album for the late sex offender as an effort “to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!”\nLeavitt’s deputy, Taylor Budowich, chimed in on X with what he presented as definitive visual evidence that “it’s not his signature”, in the form of four images of Trump’s signature on cards inserted in copies of a book about the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania last year.\nHowever, it appears that all four of those signatures were from 2024, more than two decades after the 2003 birthday note, and it is a documented fact that people’s handwriting and signatures commonly change as they age.\nAndrew Feinberg, a White House correspondent for the Independent, posted two images of Trump’s signature from the years before 2003 on X, which appear closer to the one on the note to Epstein.\nNewsom accuses supreme court of unleashing 'racial terror in Los Angeles'\nGavin Newsom, California’s governor, has denounced the US supreme court ruling that permits federal immigration agents to demand proof of citizenship from anyone who appears to be of Latin American origin or is speaking a foreign language in Los Angeles, a city with a population that is 35% foreign-born and where 56% speak a language other than English at home, in a county that is nearly 50% Latino.\nNewsom said, of the 6-3 ruling by the Republican-nominated majority:\nTrump’s hand-picked supreme court majority just became the Grand Marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles. This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws – it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including US citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses. Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family – and every person is now a target – but we will continue fighting these abhorrent attacks on Californians.\nRepublican senators open investigation of 'botched' response to Palisades fire\nTwo Republican senators announced on Monday that they are opening a congressional investigation of “the preparation for and response to” the deadly Palisades fire in Los Angeles by state and local officials in California, who are Democrats.\nThe senators, Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said in a press release that the fire, which burned for 24 days in January and killed at least 12 people, “was more than just a horrific tragedy, it was an unacceptable failure of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens”.\nIn a separate news release last week, Scott accused California Democrats of having “botched” the response to the California wildfires.\nHowever, the senate investigation appears to focus only on the fire in the affluent Palisades, where Scott was taken on a tour last month by a former reality TV star turned rightwing podcaster, Spencer Pratt, and not on the Eaton fire, which burned through Altadena, a less well-off suburb to the east.\nAs soon as the investigation was announced, Pratt, a conservative Palisades resident, folded it into a partisan attack on California Democrats in a social media video. “Why is it that only Republicans are interested in finding out why a California city burned to the ground?” Pratt asked.\nThe Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, announced three weeks ago that the city had been asked by the justice department to wait until federal investigation is complete to release its “after action report” on the Palisades fire.\nI’ve been speaking with Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, about the ruling from a federal appeals court today which upheld the defamation lawsuit by writer E Jean Carroll, and orders that Donald Trump still pay an $83m judgment.\nTobias said that the ruling is significant because it affirms substantial “punitive damages” – which comprise around $65m of the total award to Carrol. These “send a message” to the president, according to Tobias, to avoid further defamation.\nWhile Tobias isn’t surprised by the ruling, characterizing Judge Lewis A Kaplan – who tried the case in the district court – as a “savvy, experienced jurist, who has resolved many high profile cases” – he fully expects the Trump administration to challenge the decision and attempt to appeal to the supreme court.\nPer my last post, Robert Garcia, a representative who serves as the ranking member on the House oversight committee, said that Donald Trump is lying about the existence of his birthday note to Jeffrey Epstein.\nIn a video, posted to X, Garcia said that the president is “leading a White House cover-up”. The lawmaker from California added that committee members plan to review the documents that they received from the Epstein estate today.\nHouse Democrats share Trump 'birthday note' to Jeffrey Epstein\nDemocrats on the House oversight committee have released a scanned copy of a “birthday note” that Donald Trump allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein, that was eventually compiled into an album of messages to celebrate Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.\nThe sexually suggestive note to Epstein includes a conversation between Trump and the late sex offender, with a naked female silhouette drawn around it. The president’s signature is at the bottom of the note.\n“Happy birthday – and may every day be another wonderful secret,” the note reads.\nThe committee recently subpoenaed the Epstein estate for more documents as part of their investigation into the handling of the Epstein case. Trump has denied writing a letter for the birthday book, and even sued the Wall Street Journal for defamation when they first reported his contribution."

    "raw_text": "Trump news at a glance: Epstein case haunts Trump as alleged birthday letter released\nLetter contains purported message from Trump to Epstein in which the president says, ‘May every day be another wonderful secret’. Key US politics stories from 8 September at a glance\nQuestions over his friendship with convicted sex offender, Jeffery Epstein, continue to haunt Donald Trump, this time with the release of a birthday letter that Trump had previously denied writing.\nAn image of the birthday letter, the existence of which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in July, was released by House Democrats after the House oversight committee received the 2003 “birthday book” from Epstein’s lawyers. It is dated three years before allegations of sex abuse by Epstein became public in 2006.\nThe letter contains text of a purported dialogue between Trump and Epstein in which Trump calls him a “pal” and says, “May every day be another wonderful secret.” The text sits within a crude sketch of a silhouette of a naked woman.\nTrump has previously vehemently denied having written or illustrated the note, dismissing it as “a fake thing” and insisting “these are not my words, not the way I talk”.\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich denounced the release, saying the signature on the letter is not Trump’s while alluding to a defamation suit that Trump filed against News Corp, the parent company of the Wall Street Journal, over its original story."

    "raw_text": "Federal agents can resume sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles after the US supreme court lifted an order barring the Donald Trump administration from stopping people solely based on their race, language or job.\nThe court ruled in favor of Trump’s administration, granting a stay against a restraining order from another judge that found “roving patrols” of immigration agents were conducting indiscriminate arrests in LA. The ruling from the conservative majority is a win for the administration in its ongoing effort to enact mass deportations.\nUS district judge Maame E Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the constitution. The plaintiffs, who said the administration’s approach amounted to “blatant racial profiling”, included US citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.\nBut the Trump administration argued the order wrongly restricted agents carrying out its widespread crackdown on illegal immigration.\nThe supreme court’s 6-3 decision comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents also step up enforcement in Washington amid Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the national guard. Meanwhile, Chicago is readying itself for an immigration operation expected this week and the possible deployment of the national guard following weeks of threats.\nGavin Newsom, the California governor, condemned the decision, writing that the administration is targeting Latinos and that “Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family.”\nThe ACLU of southern California called it a “devastating setback”.\n“In running to the Supreme Court to request this stay, the government made clear that its enforcement operation in Southern California is driven by race,” Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, said in a statement. “We will continue fighting the administration’s racist deportation scheme to ensure every person living in Southern California—regardless of race or status—is safe.”\nThe Trump administration celebrated the ruling with Pam Bondi, the attorney general, describing it as a “massive victory”.\n“Now, ICE can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” she said.\nThe lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by the ACLU and immigrant advocacy groups that accused Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during a crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.\nThe Trump administration has made California a center of its deportation campaign, sending federal agents near schools and workplaces and Home Depot stores. The large show of federal agents – along with the deployment of the military – has left southern California communities in fear.\nIn its order granting the stay, the court majority wrote that the government sometimes makes stops to check the immigration status of people who work jobs in landscaping or construction, among others “that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English”.\n“Immigration stops based on reasonable suspicion of illegal presence have been an important component of US immigration enforcement for decades, across several presidential administrations,” the decision states.\nIn a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote: “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor. Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”\nDepartment of Homeland Security attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the US, not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the justice department argued that the order wrongly restricted the factors that Ice agents can use when deciding who to stop.\nThe Los Angeles region has been a battleground for the Trump administration after its hardline immigration strategy spurred protests and the deployment of the national guard and the marines. The number of immigration raids in the Los Angeles area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store.\nThe supreme court decision was condemned by LA mayor Karen Bass, who said it “isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country.\n“I want the entire nation to hear me when I say this isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country. Today’s ruling is not only dangerous – it’s un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the United States of America.”\nThe plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops without reasonable suspicion, something that aligns with the constitution and supreme court precedent.\n“Numerous US citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility.”\nThe Trump administration said the order is too restrictive, “threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop”.\nD John Sauer, the solicitor general, also argued the order can’t stand under the high court’s recent decision restricting universal injunctions, though the plaintiffs disagreed.\nThe order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It’s covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.\nPlaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two US citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a 13 June video being seized by federal agents as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”\nGavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.\nAgents arrested Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, a named plaintiff in the case, at a bus stop in June while he waited to be picked up for work.\n“When Ice grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why. I was treated like I didn’t matter – locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the supreme court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge,” said Vasquez Perdomo said in a statement following the decision."

    "raw_text": "US immigration officers are ramping up immigration sweeps in Los Angeles again after the supreme court reversed a temporary restraining order that banned the Trump administration from stopping people solely based on their race, language or job.\nIn a post on Twitter/X, Greg Bovino, the head of US border patrol in Los Angeles, called the temporary restraining order “very poorly” written and “the worst” he’s ever seen. He also said that border patrol would be starting operations back up again today.\n“We are going hard in Los Angeles today and are hitting a location as I write this,” Bovino wrote.\nImmigration officers were forced to pause their sweeping immigration raids after advocacy groups sued the Trump administration for systemically racially profiling brown-skinned people. US district judge in Los Angeles Maame E Frimpong granted the groups a temporary restraining order after finding a “mountain of evidence” that the immigration enforcement tactics were violating the constitution.\nBut the supreme court ruled 6-3 to lift those restrictions on Monday. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who voted to approve the stay on the order, wrote that the Immigration and Nationality Act allows immigration officers to “interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States”. While “ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion” it can be used as a “relevant” factor, he wrote.\nHe also contended that if a US citizen or someone who is legally in the country is stopped, “questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U.S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States”. This would require citizens and anyone who is at risk of being profiled under this new order to carry around proof of their citizenship.\nDepartment of Homeland Security called the supreme court decision a victory and vowed to continue to “flood the zone” in Los Angeles while accusing LA mayor Karen Bass of “protecting” immigrants. “DHS law enforcement will continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles. This decision is a victory for the safety of Americans in California and for the rule of law. DHS will continue to arrest and remove the criminal illegal aliens that @MayorOfLA is protecting,” read the social media post.\nAlready, several US citizens have been swept up in immigration raids across the country and detained or, in some cases, deported. In Los Angeles, for instance, US citizen and 32-year-old Andrea Velez was arrested by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency during a June raid. Charges against her were ultimately dismissed and she was released.\nKavanaugh also wrote that illegal immigration is “especially pronounced in the Los Angeles area” and that it’s not surprising then that the administration has prioritized the city as part of its nationwide immigration crackdown.\nWhile the administration is increasing its federal enforcement in cities such as Washington DC and Chicago, Los Angeles has been a center point of its immigration crackdown. Federal agents, as well as the national guard, were deployed to Los Angeles sparking fear among communities across the city. Immigration agents have targeted schools, workplaces and Home Depot locations. During a recent Ice raid at a Home Depot in LA-suburb, Monrovia, a man was hit by a car and killed when he was trying to get away from immigration officers.\nIn its order granting the reversal of the restraining order, the supreme court said it was customary for the government to stop people working in roles like landscaping or construction because those jobs “often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English”.\nIn her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that people in Los Angeles “have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.\n“Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities,” her dissent continued."

It’s in line with other large-scale events we’ve put on as a force.”\nSpeaking on the restricted airspace order, he said: “Obviously it’s an offence to fly a drone in a restricted airspace and we will have resources to deal with any of those incursions.\n“We will have plenty of capability in the sky when the time is appropriate,” he said, adding that the drones will act as an “eye in the sky” during the event.\nIt will be Trump’s second state visit to the UK – an unprecedented gesture towards a US president – after he came in 2019.\nHis first trip to the UK saw thousands of people turn out on the streets in London in opposition."

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump launched a vitriolic attack against Tom Hanks for supposedly being “destructive” and “woke” after one of America’s most beloved actors was snubbed without much explanation by West Point last week.\nOn his social media site on Monday, the US president applauded the alumni association of the US Military Academy (or West Point) for abruptly calling off a ceremony honoring Hanks, twice an Academy award winner who has played numerous military characters and also has a long history of advocating for veterans.\nTrump wrote: “Our great West Point (getting greater all the time!) has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks. Important move! We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice. Watch their DEAD RATINGS SURGE!”\nHanks had been scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award later this month for his “service and accomplishments in the national interest”.\nIn a message to faculty, retired Col Mark Bieger declared the cancellation would allow the institution to “continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army”, without elaborating how the two are connected.\nHanks has previously endorsed Democratic candidates including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\nHe has been deeply involved in veterans’ causes. He was the national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial in Washington DC. He also supported Bob Dole’s fundraising campaign for the Dwight D Eisenhower Memorial, according to the alumni association’s own original statement.\nHe has already been inducted as an honorary member into the US Army’s Ranger Hall of Fame. In 2016, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nAmong his military portrayals are Capt John Miller in Saving Private Ryan, the Vietnam war soldier Forrest Gump (for which he won the Oscar for best actor), and Cmdr Ernie Krause in Greyhound, for which he also wrote the screenplay. He also portrayed the title role in 2013’s Captain Phillips and appeared in the cold war film Bridge of Spies.\nHis work has made him one of the US’s most decorated actors, with seven Emmy awards to go alongside the five Academy award nominations for best actor, which he won twice in a row.\nTrump, who has dabbled in acting including a cameo in Home Alone 2, has regularly complained about never winning an Emmy for his reality television show The Apprentice, lamenting that he “should have gotten it”, that he “got screwed out of an Emmy” and that “the Emmys are all politics”."

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump now cannot claim presidential immunity to get off the hook from paying $83.3m in damages to the writer E Jean Carroll, a federal appeals court ruled on Monday, upholding a jury’s 2024 award against the president for defamation.\nTrump’s lawyers had pointed to the supreme court’s ruling last year saying the president has immunity for official acts to argue that the damages should be overturned. A three-judge panel for the US court of appeals for the second circuit, rejected that argument.\n“The jury’s duly rendered damages awards were reasonable in light of the extraordinary and egregious facts of this case,” the judges wrote in their unanimous opinion. The panel consisted of judges Denny Chin, an appointee of Barack Obama, as well as Sarah AL Merriam and Maria Araújo Kahn, both appointees of Joe Biden. Their decision was unanimous.\nAt an earlier stage in the case, they also concluded Trump had waived his right to argue presidential immunity because he had not raised it earlier.\n“We conclude that Trump has failed to identify any grounds that would warrant reconsidering our prior holding on presidential immunity,” the panel wrote. “A case involving the criminal prosecution of a former President, did not alter the prevailing law on whether presidential immunity can be waived.” Justin Smith, a lawyer for Trump, had argued that presidential immunity is “not waivable”, according to Politico.\nNeither the White House nor Trump’s personal lawyers in the case immediately responded to requests for comment. The second circuit on 13 June upheld Carroll’s separate $5m jury verdict against Trump in May 2023 for a similar defamation and for sexual assault.\nCarroll, 81, a former Elle magazine columnist, accused Trump of attacking her around 1996 in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room.\nTrump first denied her claim in June 2019, telling a reporter that Carroll was “not my type” and had concocted the story to sell her memoir What Do We Need Men For?\nHe essentially repeated his comments in an October 2022 Truth Social post, leading to the $5m verdict, though the jury did not find that Trump had raped Carroll.\nThe $83.3m award comprised $18.3m of damages for emotional and reputational harm, and $65m of punitive damages. In his latest appeal, Trump argued that the US supreme court’s July 2024 decision providing him with substantial criminal immunity shielded him from liability in Carroll’s civil case.\nHe also said he had spoken about Carroll in 2019 in his capacity as president, and that failing to give him immunity could undermine the independence of the executive branch.\nTrump also said US district judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw both trials, had made other mistakes, including whether he had wrongly prevented Trump from litigating the falsity of Trump’s allegations by striking out his testimony that, in speaking about Carroll: “I just wanted to defend myself, my family, and frankly the presidency.” The panel ruled Kaplan had not erred in either instance.\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said that the ruling was significant because it affirms substantial “punitive damages” – which comprise around $65m of the total award to Carrol. These “send a message” to the president, according to Tobias, to avoid further defamation.\nWhile Tobias wasn’t surprised – characterizing Judge Lewis Kaplan, as a “savvy, experienced jurist who has resolved many high-profile cases” – he fully expects the Trump administration to challenge the decision and attempt to appeal to the supreme court."

    "raw_text": "The US supreme court allowed Donald Trump on Monday to keep a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission away from her post for now, temporarily pausing a judicial order that required the reinstatement of the commissioner who the Republican president has sought to oust.\nThe court’s action, known as an administrative stay, gives the justices additional time to consider Trump’s formal request to let him fire Rebecca Slaughter from the consumer protection agency that enforces antitrust law before her term expires.\nThe stay was issued by John Roberts, the chief justice who handles emergency filings arising in Washington DC.\nThe Trump administration had asked the US supreme court on Thursday to let him temporarily remove Slaughter as the legal fight over the Republican president’s dismissal of her plays out.\nThe request came after US district judge Loren AliKhan blocked Trump’s firing of Slaughter. AliKhan ruled in July that Trump’s attempt to remove Slaughter did not comply with removal protections in federal law. Congress put such tenure protections in place to give certain regulatory agencies a degree of independence from presidential control.\nThe US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit on 2 September in a 2-1 decision upheld the judge’s ruling, prompting the administration’s request to the supreme court.\nThe lower courts ruled that the statutory protections shielding FTC members from being removed without cause conform with the US constitution in light of a 1935 supreme court precedent in a case called Humphrey’s Executor v United States.\nIn that case, the court ruled that a president lacks unfettered power to remove FTC commissioners, faulting then president Franklin Roosevelt’s firing of an FTC commissioner for policy differences.\nThe administration in its supreme court filing argued that “the modern FTC exercises far more substantial powers than the 1935 FTC,” and thus its members can be fired at will by the president.\nThe court in a similar ruling in May said the constitution gives the president wide latitude to fire government officials who wield executive power on his behalf.\nThe administration has repeatedly asked the justices this year to allow implementation of Trump policies impeded by lower courts. The supreme court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has sided with the administration in almost every case that it has been called upon to review since Trump returned to the presidency in January."

    "raw_text": "Intent on vindication after spending four months in prison last year, Donald Trump’s White House trade adviser Peter Navarro asked a federal appeals court on Sunday night to force the justice department to explain why it would not defend his 2022 conviction for defying a January 6 committee subpoena.\nThe 13-page request, if granted by the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, would in effect require the justice department to detail publicly when – if ever – it would charge a presidential adviser who defied a congressional subpoena claiming executive privilege protections.\nThe justice department’s response in Navarro’s appeal could have far-reaching consequences on separation of power issues and define the potency of any subpoenas issued to Trump administration officials by Democrats if they retake the House next year.\nThe public accounting could also prove bruising for the department as it would almost certainly have to confront the appearance that it quietly dropped Navarro’s case this summer only because he again serves as a senior adviser to the president.\n“The department’s abrupt withdrawal now deprives the court of transparency about the department’s current view concerning the landmark constitutional issues presented, undermines the fairness of the process, and burdens the defense with uncertainty,” the filing said.\nNavarro was subpoenaed in 2022 by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot for his involvement in a plan to delay Congress’s certification of the 2020 election results to change the outcome, including to recruit state lawmakers to join the effort.\nWhen Navarro ignored that subpoena, he claimed he was immune as a former White House adviser and that Trump had intended to block any testimony to Congress in an earlier invocation of executive privilege against a subpoena from a different committee.\nThat argument proved unsuccessful at trial and Navarro was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress after the trial judge, Amit Mehta, found the letter did not apply to the January 6 panel’s subpoena and did not insulate him from answering questions unrelated to Trump that were not subject to privilege protections.\nBut once Trump returned to office, and Navarro joined the White House while his appeal was pending, federal prosecutors disclosed they were no longer taking the same positions as the Biden justice department and urged the court to appoint an external lawyer to try to uphold his conviction.\nNavarro’s filing said prosecutors should not be permitted to abruptly stop fighting against his appeal without providing a detailed explanation, as it created uncertainty on whether a senior White House adviser could be prosecuted for contempt in the first place.\n“DoJ told the courts my appeal raised no substantial questions, forcing me to surrender and lose four months of freedom. Now the same DoJ attorney of record wants to yank his own brief. You don’t make that pivot unless serious constitutional questions exist,” Navarro said in a statement to the Guardian.\nNavarro’s filing also contended that the department was obliged under US supreme court precedent to give a detailed explanation when abandoning a legal position, an effort aimed at giving lower courts greater guidance.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the justice department would voluntarily provide an explanation. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\nNavarro’s lawyers include Stan Brand and John Rowley, who represented multiple advisers in the criminal cases against Trump and worked under joint agreements with Trump’s deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche. Navarro’s third lawyer, Stanley Woodward, is the nominee to be Trump’s associate attorney general and has recused himself from the appeal."

Key US politics stories from Sunday 7 September at a glance\nDonald Trump has told foreign companies that they must hire and train American workers and respect immigration laws, after a raid at a Hyundai Motor manufacturing facility in Georgia saw about 300 South Koreans detained.\nNearly 500 workers in total were detained in the raid on Thursday, with US authorities releasing footage showing them restrained in handcuffs and ankle chains, loaded on to buses.\nThe raid marked the largest single site sweep carried out under Donald Trump’s nationwide anti-immigration campaign and appeared to strain the longstanding diplomatic and economic relationship between the US and South Korea.\n“I am hereby calling on all Foreign Companies investing in the United States to please respect our Nation’s Immigration Laws,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday, adding “Your Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people … What we ask in return is that you hire and train American Workers.”\nTrump made the post shortly after telling reporters he would look at what happened but that the incident had not harmed his relationship with South Korea."

    "raw_text": "The Israeli military warned on social media on Tuesday that it would act with “greater force” in Gaza City and warned residents to leave.\n“To all residents of Gaza City ... the defence forces are determined to defeat Hamas and will act with greater force in the Gaza City area,” Colonel Avichay Adraee said in the post on X.\nThe Israeli military’s order for a large-scale evacuation of Gaza City on Tuesday morning is the first warning for a full evacuation of Gaza’s capital in the current round of fighting.\nAlso on Tuesday, the AP reported, defence minister Israel Katz said Israel had demolished 30 high-rise buildings in Gaza, which it accused Hamas of using for military infrastructure.\nAs just reported, Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Israel planned to destroy at least 50 “towers of terror” that he said were used by Hamas.\nHere’s footage of Benjamin Netanyahu warning residents of Gaza City on Monday to “leave now”, hours after Israel said it would escalate airstrikes on the territory.\nIt came as Gaza’s health ministry said hospitals had received the bodies of 65 people killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, with another 320 people wounded.\nThe Israeli prime minister says in his address that over the past couple of days the Israeli air force has taken down 50 “terrors towers” and “this is only an introduction” to a “powerful main act, which is a ground manoeuvre of our forces which are now assembling and organising, into Gaza City”.\nNetanyahu also said, addressing “the residents of Gaza”: “you have been warned: leave now”.\nIsrael’s large-scale evacuation order for Gaza City residents comes as mediation efforts by the US, Qatar and Egypt have failed to bridge gaps between Israel and Hamas in order to secure a ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages Hamas holds in Gaza.\nIsrael had already taken control of 75% of Gaza since the war began with Hamas’ October 2023 assault on southern Israel in which some 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken as hostage back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\nIsraeli authorities say 20 of the remaining 48 hostages in Gaza are alive, as Reuters reports.\nIsrael’s subsequent military assault has killed more than 62,000 Palestinians, Gaza’s health ministry says, as well as internally displacing nearly the entire population and leaving much of the territory in ruins.\nIsrael’s military has ordered Gaza City residents to evacuate ahead of a new offensive to seize the territory’s largest urban centre, part of a planned takeover stirring international alarm.\nTaking over the city of 1 million Palestinians complicates ceasefire efforts to end the nearly two-year war. On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu warned residents of Gaza City to leave immediately, hours after Israel said it would ramp up airstrikes. The Israeli prime minister said forces were now organising and assembling into Gaza City for a ground “manoeuvre”.\nInternational critics say Israel’s plan – which includes demilitarising the whole strip as Israel takes security control of it – could deepen the humanitarian plight of the 2.2 million people living there, who are also facing a growing famine."

    "raw_text": "Palestinian gunmen opened fire at a crowded bus stop in the northern outskirts of Jerusalem on Monday, killing six people and injuring 12 others before being shot dead by an off-duty soldier and a civilian at the scene.\nThe victims included a 79-year-old former cardiologist, a 43-year-old rabbi and a 25-year-old who had recently emigrated from Spain. Twenty-six others suffered injuries, including six who were left in a serious condition with gunshot wounds.\nIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, visited the site of the attack in Jerusalem with his far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. “The war continues, in Jerusalem as well,” Netanyahu said.\nHe later repeated calls for people in Gaza City to leave before an upcoming “ground operation” by Israeli forces. “You have been warned – get out of there,” he said.\nIsrael Katz, Israel’s defence minister, later posted on X that Gaza would face “a mighty hurricane” if Hamas did not release the last hostages it was holding.\nThe finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said: “This abominable attack will have the most severe and far-reaching consequences.\n“We will pursue terror everywhere. Just as we crushed Palestinian terror in the Jenin terror camp and the terror camps in northern Samaria – so we will soon do in additional terror camps. Whoever sponsors terror and directs terror will pay the full price.”\nAfter the attack, the Israeli military said it was encircling Palestinian villages on the outskirts of the nearby West Bank city of Ramallah.\nEyal Zamir, the Israel Defense Forces’ chief of staff, later said in a statement that he “ordered a full closure of the area from which the terrorists came”.\n“We will continue with a determined and ongoing operational and intelligence effort, we will pursue terror cells everywhere, and we will thwart terrorist infrastructure and its organisers,” he said.\nMahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, issued a statement condemning “any targeting of Palestinian and Israeli civilians”.\nHamas praised two Palestinian “resistance fighters” who it said had carried out the attack, but stopped short of claiming responsibility. Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, also praised the shooting without claiming responsibility.\nIn Gaza, meanwhile, the Israeli military said four Israeli soldiers were killed on Monday after an explosive device was thrown into their tank. Another soldier was injured during the ensuing exchange of fire, while “hits were identified” on two of the three militants who carried out the assault, it said.\nGaza hospitals received the bodies of 65 people killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, with another 320 people wounded, the territory’s health ministry said .\nThe war in Gaza has sparked a rise in violence in the occupied West Bank and in Israel. Palestinian militants have attacked and killed Israelis, while there has been a steep rise in settler violence against Palestinians.\nData from the UN’s humanitarian office says at least 49 Israelis have been killed by Palestinians in Israel or the West Bank between the start of the war and July 2025. In that time, Israeli forces and civilians have killed at least 968 Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank.\nOn Monday evening, Wafa, the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority, said Israeli forces had killed a 14-year-old Palestinian during a raid in Jenin, in the north of the West Bank. There was no immediate confirmation of the report.\nThe attack took place at the Ramot intersection at the northern entrance to Jerusalem in an area occupied by Israel in 1967 and later annexed – a move the UN and most countries do not recognise. The busy intersection was choked by cars and commuters during the rush hour.\nImages shared on social media appeared to show a Carlo submachine gun discarded at the scene.\nThese weapons can be crudely manufactured in small metal shops, and models produced by gunsmiths in the West Bank have been used in attacks by Palestinians on Israelis.\nWhile there have been scattered attacks in Israel over recent months, the last deadly mass shooting was in October 2024, when two Palestinians from the West Bank opened fire on a major boulevard and light railway station in the Tel Aviv area, killing seven people and leaving many others wounded. Hamas’s military wing claimed responsibility for that attack.\nFrance strongly condemned the attack on Monday in a post on social media. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, offered his condolences to the victims and the Israeli people.\n“The spiral of violence must come to an end. Only a political solution will bring back peace and stability for all in the region,” he said on X.\nSpain, the EU, Germany and the United Arab Emirates also issued statements of condemnation."

    "raw_text": "Homemade guns produced by local gunsmiths in the West Bank are driving an increase in the use of firearms in attacks by Palestinians on Israelis.In particular, the use of “Carl Gustav” or “Carlo” submachine guns – crudely manufactured in small metal shops and modelled on a Swedish weapon from the 1950s – has become increasingly apparent.\nOn Monday, such a gun was one of two weapons used in a attack on Israeli soldiers near Hebron, one of two car-ramming attacks (£) at the entrance to the southern West Bank Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.\nCarl Gustav-style weapon have been used in many of the 68 shootings that have targeted Israelis since 1 October, when the current wave of violence began.\nSuch a gun was also used in an attack in East Jerusalem last week that injured two Israeli policemen.\nAccording to the Israeli domestic security service and Israel Defence Forces, dozens of homemade guns and items for gun fabrication have been seized in raids in recent months, most recently on Saturday when 15 rifles were discovered in a village near Jenin following the arrest of a gunsmith.\nVideo footage of that raid showed an officer from Shin Bet, Israel’s security agency, removing guns wrapped in cloth and hidden behind plaster in the ceiling of a house.\nTwo weeks earlier a gunmaking workshop was uncovered near Nablus. It included guns, a metalworking lathe and ammunition.\nThe use of homemade guns shows how much the Palestinian Authority’s security forces and Palestinian factions have kept control over their large number of weapons.\nA Carl Gustav and an improvised sniper rifle with a silencer made from an oil can were also seized during the arrest of two young brothers from Hebron accused of being behind a series of recent sniper attacks in which two soldiers and two civilians were wounded.\nThe original homemade Carl Gustav was first identified in 2000. That gun was a crude but effective weapon with a simple barrel welded into a tubular metal stock, with a straightforward grip and a spring-operated firing mechanism.\nThe weapon was cheap and relatively easy to produce and it was initially popular with Palestinian and Arab-Israeli criminals involved in drug trafficking and dealing on the West Bank.\nAccording to some analysts, the popularity of the Carl Gustav has been driven by the unavailability of more conventional modern weapons and their prohibitively high price on the parallel market. AK47s and Tavors can cost up to $10,000 (£7,000) while the cheapest Carl Gustavs cost about $500.\nConcern over the increasing use of the weapons – one of which was used to kill a 19-year old Israeli policewoman at the Damascus gate of Jerusalem’s Old City in February – has prompted a drive in recent weeks by the Shin Bet and Israeli army to break up production of the homemade guns.\nSpeaking after the death of Hadar Cohen, last month, Israel police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld noted that while the Carl Gustavs were not “military grade, manufactured weapons” they were coming closer to that level.\nAccording to a senior official quoted by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz over the weekend, the spread of the Carlo was encouraged by the Shin Bet’s relative lack of interest in the arms being used for Palestinian criminality. This was despite the fact that weapons shops producing them were known about as early as 2012.\n“The Shin Bet did not see a criminal issue affecting Arab communities as something that would one day be on their doorstep,” the official told the paper. “Their primary effort was against the main terror organisations – Hamas, Fatah, Islamic Jihad – and not the criminals from [Israeli-Arab town] Tira.”\nThe DIY guns have, however, increasingly fitted into an emerging pattern of violence that has seen either individuals or small groups of friends or associates, largely unrelated to factions, organise “lone wolf” attacks. Another advantage of the homemade guns is a lack of serial numbers, making them more discreet and harder to trace.\nThe growing issue was highlighted this month by the case of two young Arab-Israeli men from Nazareth who were accused of saving up their money – reportedly inspired by Islamic State – to buy a gun for an attack on a military checkpoint.\n“A genuine M16 [assault rifle] now costs 60,000 to 70,000 shekels [£10,700-£12,500] on the street, whereas an improvised gun can cost as little as 2,000 shekels,” one Palestinian told Reuters this month. “For a young person looking to carry out an attack with limited resources, the choice is obvious.”"

    "raw_text": "David Lammy has joined 20 other foreign ministers around the world in condemning Israeli plans to build an illegal settlement on the West Bank, with the Foreign Office summoning the Israeli ambassador to communicate the government’s displeasure.\nThe foreign secretary co-signed a joint statement on Thursday criticising the so-called E1 plan, a 3,400-home settlement that critics say would divide the West Bank in half.\nOfficials then summoned Tzipi Hotovely to the Foreign Office in a rare public rebuke for the Israeli ambassador. The actions marked a further intensification of recent international criticism for Israel over its tactics in Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe statement, which was signed by 21 countries including the UK, Australia, Canada and France, said: “The decision by the Israeli higher planning committee to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, is unacceptable and a violation of international law. We condemn this decision and call for its immediate reversal in the strongest terms.”\nIn a separate statement, the Foreign Office confirmed it had summoned Hotovely in a display of public criticism. “If implemented, these settlement plans would be a flagrant breach of international law and would divide a future Palestinian state in two, critically undermining a two-state solution,” the department said in a statement.\nIt did not say which minister or official had met Hotovely or what was said in the meeting. The Israeli embassy did not respond to a request for comment.\nIsrael announced on Wednesday it had approved plans to build the major new block in the West Bank, with the deliberate intention – according to Israel’s far-right finance minster, Bezalel Smotrich – of preventing the creation of a Palestinian state.\nSmotrich on Wednesday called the decision to approve the settlement a “significant step that practically erases the two-state delusion and consolidates the Jewish people’s hold on the heart of the land of Israel”.\nThe proposals would extend the Jewish settlement of Ma’ale Adumim towards Jerusalem, further separating occupied East Jerusalem from the West Bank, and dividing the north and south of the territory.\nThe statement by the 21 foreign ministers said: “Minister Smotrich says this plan will make a two-state solution impossible by dividing any Palestinian state and restricting Palestinian access to Jerusalem. This brings no benefits to the Israeli people. Instead, it risks undermining security and fuels further violence and instability, taking us further away from peace.”\nBritish officials say Israel’s renewed expansionism in the West Bank has played a critical role in pushing them into a decision to recognise Palestine as an independent state. Keir Starmer said last month he would issue formal recognition before next month’s UN general assembly, unless Israel committed to a ceasefire and a two-state solution.\nThe international community has also expressed outrage over Israel’s plan to take control of Gaza City, with the UN assistant secretary general, Miroslav Jenča, warning it would cause “forced displacement, killings and destruction”.\nThe Israel Defense Forces said on Wednesday that Benjamin Netanyahu had instructed them to accelerate the planned assault on Gaza City, the prospect of which has already prompted thousands of Palestinians to flee.\nOn Thursday the UK was one of 27 countries to sign a separate statement demanding that international journalists be given access to Gaza to allow them to cover the “unfolding humanitarian catastrophe” in the war zone.\nThe statement from the Media Freedom Coalition (MFC), an international advocacy group that the UK helped to create, said: “We … urge Israel to allow immediate independent foreign media access and afford protection for journalists operating in Gaza.”"

    "raw_text": "Awdah Hathaleen, the prominent Palestinian activist who was killed late last month by an extremist Jewish settler in the West Bank, filmed the moment he was shot, newly released video footage reveals.\nHathaleen, who worked on the filming of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, which examined settler violence against the Palestinian community of Masafer Yatta, was killed by Yinon Levi, a settler who was already under sanctions in the UK and EU for violent acts against Palestinians.\nThe footage – released by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem – appears to offer clear evidence of Levi’s direct involvement in the killing of Hathaleen, an English teacher and activist resident in Umm al-Khair in the south Hebron hills, on 28 July, in an incident that sparked international outrage.\nLevi was arrested over the killing but quickly released by a court after a ruling that the evidence he had fired at Hathaleen had “weakened”.\nLevi has denied he fired the shot that killed Hathaleen. However, the footage filmed by Hathaleen himself shows Levi draw his weapon and fire in Hathaleen’s direction. Hathaleen is then heard groaning and falling to the ground.\nHathaleen was filming settlers operating an earth mover when he was shot. According to witnesses, a confrontation that was taking place between Levi and Palestinian residents became more heated when the digger attempted to approach a fenced-off grove belonging to a Palestinian family, with at least one stone thrown.\nThe footage, filmed from some distance away, shows Levi waving a gun and scuffling with residents as they attempt to block the earth mover.\nLevi can then be seen taking several steps to his right before raising his gun, aiming it in Hathaleen’s direction, and firing. The footage sharply contradicts claims by Levi’s lawyer, Avichai Hajbi, that he had been “forced to fire his weapon into the air” because he felt his life was in danger.\nHathaleen’s footage is backed up by witness evidence provided to B’Tselem, including by his brother-in-law Alaa Hathaleen, who was present at the time of the killing and is seen in the footage remonstrating with Levi at close quarters and attempting to film the events himself with his phone.\n“The settler Yinon Levi arrived,” Alaa Hathaleen told B’Tselem. “The residents shouted at him, and he drew his gun. I tried to film him pulling out the gun, but he attacked me and grabbed my phone.\n“Suddenly, while we were trying to move people away and the excavator was already on the road leading to the settlement, Yinon Levi fired one shot, and then another shot.\n“I heard shouts: ‘Awdah! Awdah!’ I turned around and found my cousin Awdah lying in the public garden of Umm al-Khair’s community centre. He was bleeding heavily from the chest and mouth. It turned out he had been shot while filming the events, from about 40 meters away, behind a metal fence we had put up around the garden.”\nLevi was sanctioned by the UK in 2024, along with others, because he “used physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities”.\nLevi’s treatment by the courts since the shooting is in line with a long history of lenient treatment by both the Israeli civilian and military courts of Israelis who kill Palestinians."

    "raw_text": "Israeli police have refused to release the body of Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist who helped make the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, while the settler accused of killing him, Yinon Levi, has been released from custody.\nHathaleen was shot to death on Monday night during a confrontation between settlers driving a bulldozer in the village of Umm al-Khair in the occupied West Bank and residents of the town. A video appears to show Levi firing his gun wildly and then people screaming as Hathaleen, standing a distance away in the town centre, collapsed.\nLevi was released from custody by a court on Tuesday and placed under three days of house arrest, which ends tomorrow and allows him to roam free. According to Levi’s lawyer, Avihai Hajabi, the court found that there was evidence supporting his claims that he acted in self-defence, and ordered his release.\nLevi, who was earlier put under sanctions by the then US president Joe Biden and later removed from the sanctions list by Donald Trump, could still face charges.\nDespite the release of Levi, Hathaleen’s family is still struggling to recover his body from Israeli police so that they can hold his funeral.\n“It’s devastating. His body is still being held and the killer is free. His mother and his wife – they keep asking where he is, when his body will come back. I have no answers any more. I tell them an hour, two hours, but I don’t know,” said Salem Hathaleen, the elder brother of Awdah.\nIsraeli police said they would not release Hathaleen’s body until his family agreed to 10 conditions, including limiting the funeral to 15 people and burying his body outside his birth village, according to a lawyer representing the family.\n“The idea is that the police want the funeral to be really small and quiet, so that it is like it never happened and nobody will come,” said Karin Wind, who has reviewed the conditions and is communicating with the police on behalf of the family.\nAccording to a police document seen by the Guardian, police requested that no “signs calling for incitement” be displayed or “amplification” system used at the funeral, with the police requesting a deposit from the family to ensure they complied with conditions. The family refused to sign the document and its conditions.\n“Fifteen people – this would mean basically half his siblings and children couldn’t even attend,” said Salem.\nThe Guardian reached out to the Israeli police and the military for a comment but did not receive one by the time of publication. The Israeli military has claimed the conditions are necessary to preserve public order.\nIsraeli soldiers raided the tent erected for mourners on Tuesday, declaring it a closed military zone as they pushed mourners out and threw stun grenades at activists and journalists in attendance.\n“Coming to the place that he was killed, where they killed him, and kicking people out? This is not a life, this is against any law in the world,” said Awdeh’s brother Alaa Hathaleen, who witnessed him die.\nThe Guardian attempted to reach Alaa Hathaleen for a comment on Thursday but discovered he had been arrested, along with 13 other residents, by the Israeli military.\nMore than 70 women from the village declared on Thursday that they were going on hunger strike until the police returned the body of Awdeh Hathaleen.\nActivists and relatives of Hathaleen said the case underscored what they called a system of impunity for Israeli settlers as they committed a wave of violence against Palestinians. At least 1,010 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000 have been injured in the West Bank by Israeli settlers and soldiers since October 2023.\nOn Thursday morning, another settler attack was carried out in the village of Silwad in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority said Israeli settlers descended upon the village and set fire to homes and cars in the village, killing a Palestinian man.\n“Forty-year-old Khamis Abdel-Latif Ayad was martyred due to smoke inhalation caused by fires set by settlers in citizens’ homes and vehicles in the village of Silwad at dawn,” the Palestinian health ministry said in a statement.\nThe Israeli military said in a statement to Agence France-Presse that several suspects set fire to property and vehicles in Silwad, but that they were unable to identify the suspects. The Israeli police said it had launched an investigation into the incident.\nAccountability for settlers who commit acts of violence against Palestinians is rare. Israeli settlements are considered illegal under international law, but their development has been accelerated under the current rightwing government.\nThe Israeli government distributed 29 all-terrain vehicles, in addition to security and logistical equipment including drones and night vision goggles, to settlements on Wednesday. At the ceremony to hand over the equipment, the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said: “The agricultural farms and young settlements are the spearhead of Zionist settlement in Judea and Samaria.”\nThe killing of Hathaleen prompted a wave of international condemnation. The French ministry of foreign affairs released a statement urging the Israeli government to hold Hathaleen’s killer accountable and calling settler violence “a matter of terrorism”.\nUmm al-Khair is within Area C of the West Bank, which is under full Israeli control and sits just below the Israeli settlement of Carmel. All settlements in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, are illegal under international law.\n“There’s a saying here: ‘The dignity of the dead is in burial.’ When someone is killed, there should be immediate burial. It brings some small relief to the heart. But until now, we’ve received neither the body nor the right to do anything,” said Salem."

    "raw_text": "Two UK charities have transferred millions of pounds to an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank with the endorsement of the charities regulator, the Guardian can reveal.\nDocuments show that the Kasner Charitable Trust (KCT), via a conduit charity, UK Toremet, has donated approximately £5.7m to the Bnei Akiva Yeshiva high school in Susya, in the Israeli-occupied territory.\nAs the budget of the school increased significantly as a result of the donations, the number of pupils, employees at the school and Susya residents have all increased.\nDror Etkes, an expert on Israeli settlement, said: “The school is likely the largest single source of employment in the settlement, and constitutes one of the main elements of the entire settlement’s existence.”\nSusya was established in or around 1983, south of Hebron, adjacent to and impinging on the pre-existing Palestinian village of Khirbet Susiya (commonly known as just Susiya). In 1986, the Israeli authorities declared the main residential area of Susiya an archaeological site and evicted all of its residents, according to Amnesty International.\nIn March, settlers launched an attack on the Susiya home of Hamdan Ballal, one of the directors of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land.\nIn 2016 the Charity Commission wrote to UK Toremet saying: “A donation to a school in the occupied territories would be a donation for the advancement of education and therefore on the face of it a legitimate grant for UK Toremet to make.”\nThe former Conservative party chair Sayeeda Warsi said: “It’s appalling that any British national should be engaged in funding illegal settlements on occupied land – and it’s even more disturbing that this is being subsidised by all of us taxpayers.\n“I’m sure the vast majority of my colleagues in Westminster will share my outrage that the Charity Commission is greenlighting these donations. Serious action must be taken so that settlements which are illegal under international law, and at the heart of a regime of discrimination and displacement, cannot benefit from charitable donations.”\nAndy McDonald, a Labour MP and a solicitor, said: “The government must urgently take the steps necessary to ban the use of funds originating from the UK being used to support any aspect of the illegal occupation and ensure the Charity Commission is in no doubt about its duty in preventing such transfers and having the powers to do so.\n“Donations to illegal settlements should invalidate charitable status and result in individual prosecutions. If legislation is needed, we must do it.”\nConcerns have previously been raised about charitable donations from the UK to Israeli settlements but this is believed to be the first time there has been a definitive paper trail of a major transfer of funds to an illegal settlement.\nIn a written answer in parliament in 2015, the government said the Charity Commission, which covers England and Wales, had written to UK Toremet’s trustees “and will be meeting them to review … [its] governance, policies, procedures and operational activity”.\nThe following year the commission confirmed it had an “open case” and that UK Toremet had been issued with “an action plan” and its compliance was being monitored.\nThe £5.7m of donations were made subsequently, between 2017 and 2021. When the law firm Hickman & Rose contacted the commission about them in 2022 it replied that the issues raised were not within its regulatory role as they involved allegations of war crimes and advised the solicitors to report the matter to the police.\nThe lawyers accordingly approached the counter-terrorism command, SO15, about individuals within the two charities. SO15 responded in March this year that it would not be pursuing a criminal investigation, based on reasons that the lawyers plan to contest, but said it would be highlighting the UK position on illegal settlements to the commission “with our concerns”.\nA Charity Commission spokesperson said: “We know this is a highly contentious issue about which there are strongly held opposing views. The commission can only operate within our legal framework, and the fact that a charity operates in the occupied Palestinian territories does not in itself constitute a criminal offence or breach of charity law.”\nIt said it referred all potential criminal matters to the relevant law enforcement body, adding: “Given the complex legal issues in relation to international law we are in the process of seeking renewed specialist advice from the attorney general.”\nA UK Toremet spokesperson said it was “not driven by any political or ideological agenda: and grants were made within the scope of English charity law”, highlighting the 2016 letter from the commission about educational donations.\nA KCT spokesperson questioned whether the settlement was illegal. Before ending the call, he said the donation was for a “religious school, not for settlement purposes”, denied KCT was in any way encouraging the settlement and said the commission had “cleared” the donations."

    "raw_text": "When an Iranian missile bound for the industrial port of Haifa dropped out of the sky on the town of Tamra on Saturday night, it fell on Israel’s most vulnerable, and in one devastating flash, lit up the country’s deepest divide.\nThe missile demolished a three-storey stone house and killed four members of the same family: Manar Khatib, and her two daughters – Shada, a university student, and Hala, a 13-year-old schoolgirl – as well as Manar’s sister-in-law, Manal.\nIt was a solid house built in an old Arab style and it had two “safe rooms’”, one on each floor. When they heard the air raid sirens Manar and her daughters ran to the one on the second floor as they had practised, but the reinforced concrete did not protect them. They were blown apart and the floor under them fell on the safe room directly below, crushing Manal.\nThe blast blew the core out of the building, and sent the neighbours flying. About 40 people were injured, though none of the wounds were life-threatening.\n“The explosion was so loud I can still hear it,” said Azmeh Kiwan, a 50-year-old homeowner who lived directly opposite.\nWhen he opened his eyes, the whole district was in total darkness. It was only when the town’s rescue workers came with their bright lights that the neighbours could see the road was full of rubble, and it was only when the sun rose that they saw body parts scattered on their terraces and roofs.\nKheir Abu-Elhija, a local first responder, who was one of the first on the scene, said he had worked 20 years as a nurse and never seen anything like it.\n“The second floor safe room came right down on the first floor safe room and crushed everything,” he said. “The only way we could find Manal’s remains was by a trail of blood,” he said.\nThe war between Israel and Iran involves powerful modern weapons that can turn a human body into vapour and scraps in an instant. Israel also has modern air defences which have managed thus far to intercept most of the incoming Iranian missiles. And for three-quarters of the country there are underground bunkers, a virtual guarantee of survival.\nBut the Khatib family did not have a bunker. They were Palestinian citizens of Israel, like the rest of the 37,000 population of this old hillside town in the Lower Galilee. And in common with most Palestinian-majority towns, Tamra does not have a single underground shelter. Like much else in Israel, there is nothing equal about the way death comes from the sky.\n“The Israeli government, since the creation of the state, didn’t invest in one public shelter for the Arab part of society,” Tamra’s mayor, Mussa Abu Rumi, said. The reinforced “safe rooms” in new-build houses are an inferior alternative, as the fate of the Khatibs showed, and Abu Rumi said only 40% of Tamra residents even have those.\n“I would like to think that the government, since missiles have become part of warfare, will start a multi-dimensional programme to invest in the Arab community, and building shelters would be part of that,” the mayor said.\nAsked if he thought the current hard-right coalition would pursue such a programme, he shook his head and admitted there was “no hope”.\nWhile missile strike sites in Tel Aviv, Rishon ReZion and Bat Yam have been flooded with rescue workers, home front troops, police and volunteers, most of the clear-up in Tamra was done by neighbours and a handful of municipal workers.\nTaking a water break on a shaded terrace, Azmeh Kiwan and his elder brother Bassam, who live directly across from the Khatib house, made clear in an interview they identified themselves as Israeli Arabs. Tamra is an ancient Arab village, they pointed out.\n“I am from here. I belong to this place and I will die here,” Azmeh said. The brothers also declared themselves fully behind the war against Iran, a country they described as a wellhead of terrorism.\nIt was only afterwards, when the tape recorder was off, that another neighbour came forward to vent his anger, which he claimed was shared by all of Tamra, at a video that had circulated since last night.\nIt was filmed from a nearby Jewish town, and showed missiles and Israeli interceptors streaking across the black sky, but when a missile falls short and slams into Tamra, you can hear people around the camera rejoicing.\n“To the village! To the village!” one man cries, and then several women’s voices join in, someone starts clapping and together they sing a verse that has become a Jewish extremist anthem. It consists of one line: “May your village burn” sung over and over again.\n“Please write about this,” the neighbour said. “If I say anything I will have 20 police cars at my house.”\nAbu Rumi said he knows where the video was made, and has informed the Israeli government and the police, but has little expectation of anyone being brought to justice.\n“We are trying to engage with Israeli society all the time,” the mayor said. “What we find is hatred, and people who don’t see you as a legitimate human being in this place.”\nHe said the centre in Israeli politics had collapsed, and with it the few protections Palestinian citizens of Israel could count on.\n“The political power that the settler parties have in government is creating this division,” he said. “They just see you as an Arab no matter where you are from.”\nAyman Odeh, a member of the Knesset who is a personal friend of the Khatib family, said: “There is a connection between the politics of this government and those who are celebrating this terrible situation.”\nOdeh argued that war with Iran is just the latest symptom of an untreated wound at the heart of the Middle East.\n“It is all connected to the Palestinian issue, and as long as we do not resolve the Palestinian issue we will keep going in circles for ever,” he said. He added that it was also the outcome of Benjamin Netanyahu’s need for conflict to stay in office.\n“Netanyahu is using this war for political reasons,” Odeh said. “He’s putting everyone in danger in the region with this war, and the war in Gaza. This is the most fascist and dangerous government that we ever had, and it is a danger to everyone.”"

    "raw_text": "Israel has said it will establish 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, including the legalisation of outposts already built without government authorisation, after a security cabinet vote held in secret last week.\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, capturing it from Jordan, in the six-day war of 1967. Since then, successive governments have tried to permanently cement Israeli control over the land, in part by declaring swathes as “state lands”, which prevents private Palestinian ownership.\nThe motion was said to have been put forward by the far-right defence minister, Israel Katz, and the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in the West Bank settlement of Kedumim, which is considered illegal under international law.\nKatz said the settlement decision “strengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria”, using the biblical term for the West Bank, “anchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism”.\nHe added it was also “a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel”.\nA spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem said: “Israel continues to promote Jewish supremacy through the theft of Palestinian land and the ethnic cleansing of the West Bank. The Israeli government is openly and blatantly working to destroy the Palestinian people, and any chances for a normal future for the people living between the Jordan River and the sea.”\nThe spokesperson added: “The international community is enabling Israel’s crimes by standing aside while millions of Palestinians are subjected to this racist and brutal regime of the Israeli government.”\nThe government intends to use the 22 settlements to bolster Israel’s presence around Route 443, which connects Jerusalem and Tel Aviv via Modiin and was described by Israel Ganz, the head of the Yesha council umbrella group of West Bank Jewish municipalities, as “the most important decision since 1967”.\nThe minister said on X: “We have made a historic decision for the development of settlements: 22 new communities in Judea and Samaria, renewing the settlement of the north of Samaria, and reinforcing the eastern axis of the state of Israel.”\nLast July Israel approved the largest seizure of land in the occupied West Bank in more than three decades, according to a report released by Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement watchdog.\nAt the time, the Israeli government approved the appropriation of 12.7 sq km (nearly 5 sq miles) of land in the Jordan valley, indicating it was “the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords”, referring to the start of the peace process.\nIn a leaked recording captured by Peace Now last year, Smotrich, during a conference for his National Religious Party-Religious Zionism, disclosed that the land confiscations in 2024 surpassed previous years’ averages by approximately tenfold.\nHe said: “This thing is mega-strategic and we are investing a lot in it. This is something that will change the map dramatically.”\nIn May 2023, Smotrich, who said his “life’s mission is to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state”, instructed Israeli government ministries to prepare for a further 500,000 Israeli settlers to move into the occupied West Bank.\nOn 20 June, the Guardian revealed how the Israeli military had quietly handed over significant legal powers in the West Bank to pro-settler civil servants working for Smotrich.\nAn order posted by the Israel Defense Forces on its website on May 2024 transfers responsibility for dozens of bylaws at the Civil Administration – the Israeli body governing in the West Bank – from the military to officials led by Smotrich at the defence ministry.\nIn March, a statement issued by Peace Now said that between 1 January and 19 March, 10,503 housing units were promoted, surpassing the 9,971 units approved throughout the whole of 2024.\nThe approval of new settlements by Benjamin Netanyahu’s far-right government represents a further implementation of its longstanding goal to annex the occupied Palestinian territory – an objective bolstered by the Trump administration.\nMike Huckabee, nominated as Trump’s new ambassador to Israel, signalled his support for Israeli claims on the West Bank in an interview last year. He said: “When people use the term ‘occupied’, I say: ‘Yes, Israel is occupying the land, but it’s the occupation of a land that God gave them 3,500 years ago. It is their land.’”\nRightwing settlers have described top officials in Trump’s new administration, which rescinded sanctions imposed on violent Israeli settler groups, as a “dream team” that would offer a “special opportunity” to permanently end any prospect of a Palestinian state.\nAssociated Press contributed to this report"

    "raw_text": "Survivors of an attack by violent Israeli settlers have described being “hunted” across a West Bank valley by men armed with pistols, rifles and batons, who beat them so badly that all 10 had to be taken to hospital for their injuries.\nThey included a 14-year-old Palestinian boy, eight other Palestinians and an Israeli activist, who had three cameras, his phone, car keys and wallet stolen.\nMoments before the attackers reached the activist, Avishay Mohar, he managed to remove and hide memory cards with photos documenting the early stages of the attack.\nThe assailants, some of them masked, descended on Palestinians dismantling the last homes in the village of Mughayyir al-Deir, east of Ramallah. Its residents had all been forced out by Israeli settlers in an aggressive campaign that lasted less than a week.\nA group, including two men on UK sanctions list had before established an illegal outpost, consisting of just a basic shelter and a sheep pen, barely 100 metres from a Palestinian home.\nAlthough settlers have long used illegal outposts to harass and displace Palestinians from their land, setting one up effectively inside a village was unprecedented. Rights groups warned it was a sign of both settler impunity and official tolerance for increasingly open and violent land grabs.\nImages of the latest violence were later recovered by Mohar, a photographer who works for B’Tselem, one of Israel’s most influential human rights groups.\n“I went to document the residents fleeing the village,” he told the Guardian. “Throughout the day, settlers that now live in an outpost located dozens of metres from the village started wandering around provoking the residents.”\nWhen the attack began on Saturday, the group of activists called in the police and the army. Within minutes, a military truck arrived, and soldiers moved in to disperse the settlers, eventually persuading them to retreat to their outpost.\nBut once the soldiers had left, the settlers resumed their assault on the Palestinians. They climbed on to the roof of a livestock shed the villagers had been dismantling and began trying to push Palestinians off the structure.\n“At that point, the Palestinians tried to defend themselves and the settlers started hitting them, Mohar says. They started throwing stones on both sides. Meanwhile, the settlers started making phone calls. I heard them calling other settlers, telling them that the stones were being thrown at them and to come there quickly.”\nMoments later, dozens more settlers, some masked, descended on the village aboard trucks and ATVs. Many were carrying batons; others had firearms and rifles.\n“Things escalated at that point,” he said. “One of the Palestinians got hit by a rock in his face and started bleeding. Then I saw a settler that also was hit by something. I didn’t know what it was, but he fell on the ground. He had a gun on his belt. Another settler immediately took the gun off his belt and started shooting. It was a pistol.”\nPalestinians fled alongside the activists, scrambling toward a nearby valley while settlers continued to fire shots and hurl stones.\n“My son Omar, who is just 14 years old, was taking videos to document the attack of the settlers,” said Mlehat, 47, one of the Palestinian men. “The settler used a drone to chase us. They beat my son Omar on the head, he was left more than half an hour bleeding on the scene.”\n“They did not shoot in the air,” Mohar said. “One had a pistol and two were shooting with M16s or other long rifles. Some of us were hit on the way. I was hit by a rock. On the way, two settlers caught me and hit me and stole everything from me. I had three cameras, one video camera. They stole everything and also my backpack. They searched my pants and took my wallet and car keys.”\nMohar began to run as settlers kept shooting in his direction. When they reached the main road, Palestinians and activists realised they had been surrounded.\n“We had nowhere to go,” Mohar says. “Those settlers kept shooting at us and telling us to come over to them. We understood that we had nothing to do other than to walk towards them.\n“When we got there, the settlers immediately took all of our phones and all the things we had in our pockets and smashed it with rocks. Then they made us all sit on the ground. Both masked and unmasked settlers started hitting us with batons and with rocks. They kicked us while we lay on the ground. I got hit by batons on my head, on my eyes, on my back.”\n“I was sure that they were going to kill me because they kept hitting me with batons and kicking me. But then I heard one of the settlers telling his friends – because I’m Jewish and not Palestinian – ‘don’t kill him, hit him in the balls’. Then they tried to spread my legs and hit me, but I managed to flip on my belly.”\nThe settlers left the injured where they lay and departed before the ambulance arrived. Ten Palestinians were wounded, some with multiple fractures.\n“This is all part of a project of ethnic cleansing in the West Bank,” said Mohar. “It’s not done by crazy settlers. It’s a state project. The state is informed of everything. If there was a will to stop those attacks, it would have happened in a minute.”\nTwo violent Israeli settlers, Neria Ben Pazi and Zohar Sabah, who had joined the campaign to drive Palestinians from their homes in Mughayyir al-Deir, had sanctions imposed on them last week by the UK. According to witnesses, they did not take part in the attack.\n“We lost 25 houses,” said Mlehat, father of the injured 14-year-old boy. “The whole community were displaced. Those settlers are terrorists. They pursue ethnic cleansing against us. They don’t care if you are a child or a grown-up, they do not discriminate between a man or a woman. All of us are a legitimate target for them. What can we do?”\nFor many of the families forced out, it was a second displacement at the hands of Israelis, as their parents and grandparents had been forced from land near the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva when the state was formed in 1948."

    "raw_text": "Violent Israeli settlers including two under UK sanctions have forced about 150 Palestinians to leave their village in the occupied West Bank, through a five-day intimidation campaign carried out under the watch of the Israeli police and army.\nOn Sunday morning, settlers established an illegal outpost, consisting of a basic shelter and a sheep pen, 100 metres from a Palestinian home in Mughayyir al-Deir, east of Ramallah. By Friday, dozens of villagers had already moved their flocks away, packed up their belongings and were dismantling the wooden and metal frames of their houses.\nSettlers stalked between Palestinian men who worked fast and largely in silence, grappling with the grim reality of leaving the place where most were born and grew up. A child cried as he was driven away on a truck loaded with the family’s red sofas.\n“We are all leaving,” said one villager, who asked not to be named. Settlers threw stones at some trucks as they left, and celebrated on social media.\nElisha Yered, an unofficial spokesperson for the extremist group Hilltop Youth, wrote: “This is what redemption looks like! This is a relatively large outpost that contained about 150 people from the enemy population, but it was broken.”\nYered is subject to sanctions from the UK and the EU, which said he was “part of a group of armed settlers” involved in an attack in 2023 that led to the death of a 19-year-old Palestinian, Qusai Jammal Mi’tan.\nTwo other settlers under UK sanctions, Neria Ben Pazi and Zohar Sabah, spent time at the illegal outpost this week, and Ben Pazi also worked on building a fence around Palestinian land.\nOther Bedouin came to help villagers pack up and leave, including some who understood their fear and pain intimately because violent Israeli settlers had also driven them off the land.\nThe tactics used by the settlers this week were not new. The nearby hills are dotted with the ruins of abandoned villages, at least one, Wadi as-Seeq, also targeted by the UK-sanctioned Ben Pazi.\nSettlers had never before built an outpost so close to Palestinian homes and the speed and intensity of the campaign in Mughayyir al-Deir was a sign of their growing confidence, activists said.\nPolice patrolled through the village on Friday and Israeli soldiers stood nearby. None intervened, although a “stop work” order had been issued for the illegal outpost after it was thrown up, and several settlers who spent time at it were also known to Israeli authorities for extreme violence.\nA previous Israeli commander for the central region, Maj Gen Yehuda Fuchs, tried in 2023 to bar Ben Pazi from the West Bank over violent attacks on Palestinians.\nThe only other official Israeli visitor during the week was a far-right member of the Knesset, Zvi Sukkot, who came to back the settlers. Last week, Sukkot said in a TV debate that Israel “can kill 100 Gazans in one night during a war and nobody in the world cares”.\nOne Palestinian family filed a petition with Israel’s supreme court on Thursday demanding an injunction and urgent hearing into why the military, police and local authorities did not act to prevent the forced evictions and protect Palestinians.\nA spokesperson for the Israeli military said troops operated “to ensure the security of the state of Israel and Judea and Samaria [Israel’s name for the occupied West Bank]”, and the government directs how the military should enforce orders about illegal construction.\nThe military would respond to the legal petition in court, the spokesperson said. A hearing is scheduled for next week, although by the time judges hear it the village will be empty.\nFor many of the families forced out, their move on Friday was a second displacement at the hands of Israelis, as their parents and grandparents had been forced from land near the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva when the state was formed in 1948."

    "raw_text": "Two violent Israeli settlers on whom sanctions were imposed by the UK government this week have joined a campaign to drive Palestinians from their homes in the West Bank village of Mughayyir al-Deir.\nNeria Ben Pazi’s organisation, Neria’s Farm, had sanctions imposed by London on Tuesday, as the UK suspended negotiations on a new free-trade deal with Israel over its refusal to allow aid into Gaza and cabinet ministers’ calls to “purify Gaza” by expelling Palestinians.\nThe British foreign secretary, David Lammy, attacked the “impunity” of violent settlers as he announced sanctions designed to hold them and Israeli authorities to account. “The Israeli government has a responsibility to intervene and halt these aggressive actions,” he said.\nBen Pazi himself was put on the UK sanctions list last year, with the government citing his role building illegal outposts and forcing Palestinian Bedouin families from their homes.\nThis week he made repeated long visits to an illegal outpost set up on Sunday less than 100 metres from a Palestinian home on the edge of Mughayyir al-Deir, a community of around 150 bedouins.\nAnother visitor to the outpost, photographed on Wednesday and identified by local activists, was Zohar Sabah. He visited the day after he was added to the UK sanctions list for “threatening, perpetrating, promoting and supporting acts of aggression and violence against Palestinian individuals”.\nThe settlers set up a basic shelter next to a sheep enclosure with a small herd, which formed the base for a campaign of intimidation that began immediately.\n“I haven’t slept since they came, and the children are terrified,” said Ahmad Sulaiman, a 58-year-old father of eleven whose home was closest to the outpost.\nBorn just a stone’s throw away, he had spent his life in Mughayyir al-Deir, but by Thursday he was packing to leave, although the family did not know where they would go.\n“The settlers told me: ‘This is our home’,” said Sulaiman. “There is nothing I can do. They have guns and other weapons.”\nThe intended deterrent effect of the UK sanctions was not visible at Mughayyir al-Deir, where settlers expanded their campaign of intimidation in the days after the British announcement, and the only public response from Israeli officials was a visit in support of the settlers.\nZvi Sukkot, a member of the Knesset and the far-right Religious Zionist party, was filmed by activists as he left the illegal outpost. During a debate on Israel’s Channel 12 last week Sukkot said: “Everyone has got used to the idea that we can kill 100 Gazans in one night during a war and nobody in the world cares.”\nThe hills nearby are surrounded by the burned remains of Palestinian villages, whose residents were forced out by campaigns run from similar Israeli outposts. But setting up such a short distance from the Palestinians being targeted is unprecedented.\nYonatan Mizrachi, the co-director of Settlement Watch, part of the campaign group Peace Now, said settler outposts had been getting nearer to Palestinian communities since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, “but I don’t remember any others that were established so close”.\n“It shows the settlers’ lack of fear, and the understanding that they can do what they like; they can just set up in the Palestinian community. And they didn’t come to be good neighbours,” Mizrachi added.\nSabah was indicted by Israeli authorities in September for his role in an attack on a school in Mu’arrajat East, where settlers targeted teachers, a 13-year-old pupil and the principal, who was hospitalised.\nShai Parnes, a spokesperson for the Israeli human rights group B’tselem, said: “Israeli policy to take as much land as possible hasn’t changed. But what has been changing under this current government is the total impunity for soldiers and settlers.\n“They used to hide their faces or attack at night, everything is happening much more brutal and violent and it is happening in broad daylight. They are really proud about what they’re doing, sometimes even uploading the assaults themselves to social media.”\nForced displacement began before the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent ongoing Gaza war, but has intensified since then. Around 1,200 Palestinians, nearly half of them children, have been forced to leave 20 communities, according to figures from B’tselem.\nIt is a second displacement for families such as Sulaiman’s, who lived near what is now the Israeli city of Be’er Sheva until 1948. They were forced out in the nakba, or catastrophe, in which about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes in 1948 after the creation of Israel.\nIsrael’s military occupation of the West Bank began in 1967. Around 500,000 Jewish Israelis live in settlements there, all illegal under international law. Dozens of small makeshift outposts are also illegal under Israeli law – like the one set up in Mughayyir al-Deir – but authorities rarely try to remove them.\nBen Pazi set up his own farm in the area east of Ramallah in 2018 and has been involved in attacks and land grabs in the area for many years, according to the British and US governments.\nMost use a combination of attacks on people, destruction of property and deployment of herds of sheep and goats to graze land where Palestinians have fed their flocks for decades.\nThe US state department said in 2024, when sanctions were imposed on Ben Pazi under the Biden administration: “Ben Pazi has expelled Palestinian shepherds from hundreds of acres of land. In August 2023, settlers including Ben Pazi attacked Palestinians near the village of Wadi as-Seeq.” Donald Trump lifted those sanctions.\nBen Pazi’s violence attracted the attention of Israel’s military commander for the region, Maj Gen Yehuda Fuchs, who issued an administrative order barring Ben Pazi from entering the West Bank in late 2023.\nBen Pazi’s role in the campaign to force Palestinians out of Mughayyir al-Deir was unclear. He hung up when the Guardian called to ask for comment, and did not respond to further messages. The Guardian was unable to contact Sabah.\nBen Pazi was a regular visitor to the new outpost, spending several hours there on at least three days this week, according to several Israeli activists who recognised him from work in the region.\nOn one visit he was photographed greeting an unidentified man wearing a military-style uniform. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said the country’s armed forces did not authorise or organise the forced displacement of Mughayyir al-Deir.\n“The alleged evacuation was neither conducted by [IDF troops ] nor carried out with their approval,” a spokesperson said. Asked why the military did not remove the illegal outpost, they said any demolition would be a political decision.\n“Enforcement against unlawful construction in the area is undertaken in accordance with the priorities set by the political echelon and is carried out under its authorisation,” the spokesperson said.\nBen Pazi drove a group of settlers and equipment to the edge of the village, where they started erecting a fence around land where Palestinians had lived and farmed for decades.\nParnes, of B’tselem, said: “The international community have so much more to do in terms of directing steps towards the Israeli government.\n“What is happening is not just about a violent threat in this place or that; it’s all part of a well-defended and subsidised policy run by the government.”"

    "raw_text": "Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has stepped up his scathing criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza, accusing Benjamin Netanyahu’s government of “exterminating a defenceless people” by bombing hospitals and “killing innocent boys and girls with hunger”.\nSpeaking on Monday morning to announce a raft of measures designed to increase the pressure on Netanyahu to stop the military campaign, Sánchez said that while the Spanish government would always support Israel’s right to exist and to defend itself, it felt compelled to try to “stop a massacre”.\n“Protecting your country and your society is one thing, but bombing hospitals and killing innocent boys and girls with hunger is another thing entirely,” he said.\n“What Prime Minister Netanyahu presented in October 2023 as a military operation in response to the horrific terrorist attacks has ended up becoming a new wave of illegal occupations and an unjustifiable attack against the Palestinian civilian population – an attack that the UN special rapporteur and the majority of experts already describe as a genocide.”\nThe Spanish prime minister pointed to the numbers of dead, injured, displaced and malnourished. “That isn’t defending yourself; that’s not even attacking,” he said. “It’s exterminating a defenceless people. It’s breaking all the rules of humanitarian law.”\nSánchez’s words and actions rekindled a tit-for-tat diplomatic row between Spain and Israel that culminated with Madrid deciding to recall its ambassador from Tel Aviv on Monday afternoon.\nThe Spanish socialist leader also used Monday’s televised address to hit out once again at the international community, saying major world powers had ended up “paralysed between indifference over a conflict without end and complicity with the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu”. His comments came almost a week after he told the Guardian that the response to Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory was “a failure”.\nAmong the measures he announced “to stop the genocide in Gaza and to go after its perpetrators” was a law formalising the existing, de facto prohibition on military equipment sales or purchases with Israel, and a ban on the use of Spanish ports and airspace to transport fuel or weapons to the Israeli military. Sánchez also said those “directly involved in the genocide” would not be allowed into Spain and announced increases in his country’s humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n“We know that all those measures won’t be enough to stop the invasion or the war crimes,” he said. “But we hope that they will serve to add to the pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government, to alleviate some of the suffering of the Palestinian population, and to let the Spanish people know that their country was on the right side of history when it came to one of the most infamous episodes of the 21st century.”\nSánchez’s speech drew an immediate and furious response from the Israeli government, which accused his administration of deploying “wild and hateful rhetoric” and of using a “continuous anti-Israel and antisemitic attack” to distract from corruption allegations.\nIsrael’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced that two senior leftwing Spanish politicians – the labour minister and deputy prime minister, Yolanda Díaz, and the youth minister, Sira Rego – would be banned from entering Israel because of their criticisms of Israel’s conduct in Gaza.\nSa’ar said it was clear that Díaz – the founder of the Sumar alliance, the junior partner in Sánchez’s socialist-led coalition government – was “exploiting Prime Minister Sánchez’s political weakness and dragging him, step by step, into implementing her anti-Israel and antisemitic vision”.\nThe Spanish foreign ministry described the Israeli government’s words as “false and slanderous”, called the entry ban for Díaz and Rego “unacceptable”, and said the country would not be “intimidated in its defence of peace, international law and human rights”. It also pointed out that Spain had granted citizenship to 72,000 descendants of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in 1492, and had immediately condemned Hamas’s “horrific attacks” of October 2023 and called for the release of all those who were taken hostage.\nForeign ministry sources said Spain’s ambassador was recalled “in the face of the slanderous accusations against Spain and the unacceptable measures against two members of our country’s government.”\nThe Israeli government recalled its ambassador from Madrid in November 2023 after Sánchez said he had “genuine doubts” about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law in its offensive in Gaza."

    "raw_text": "Benjamin Netanyahu’s claim that the Israeli military’s killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza on Monday night was “a tragic incident” did precious little to allay the fears of Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Nor did his assertion that “this happens in wartime”.\nSánchez, who has been one of the most outspoken and persistent European critics of the way in which Israel has prosecuted its war in Gaza after the terrorist atrocities of 7 October, described the Israeli prime minister’s “supposed explanations” as “totally unacceptable and insufficient”. He added that Spain was waiting for a full and detailed account of the killings before deciding “what action we’ll take with regard to the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu”.\nSánchez’s latest remarks – along with his announcement on Monday that Spain intends to recognise a Palestinian state by July – are a further example of how some of the more habitually taciturn members of the EU have found themselves compelled to speak up amid concerns that the bloc is failing to live up to its moral, political and humanitarian duties.\nWhile condemning Hamas’s “shocking acts of terrorism” and acknowledging Israel’s right to defend itself, Sánchez has infuriated Netanyahu’s government by calling the number of dead Palestinians “truly unbearable”, and emphasising that Israel’s response cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”. Spain’s socialist prime minister has also said he has “genuine doubts” about whether Israel is complying with international humanitarian law in its offensive in Gaza.\nIn an interview with al-Jazeera on Thursday afternoon, Sánchez said Israel’s actions in Gaza could even lead the EU to debate “whether we continue with this strategic relation or not”.\nThe language from Ireland, which is widely perceived as the most pro-Palestinian voice in the EU, has been similarly unvarnished. The outgoing taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has described the assault as “approaching revenge”, while the foreign minister, Micheál Martin, has said it was “disproportionate”.\nSome European diplomats feel history will not look kindly on the EU’s inclination to look the other way on Israel and Gaza when the bloc was all too prepared to call out Russia’s actions in Ukraine. One senior diplomatic source told the Guardian that Spain and Ireland’s strong positions on Palestine were beginning to pay off, adding that each time Madrid and Dublin spoke out, the loneliness of their stance faded and others were emboldened to join them.\nBoth Sánchez and Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, are adamant that the two-state solution remains the only answer to the crisis in the Middle East – hence the Spanish government’s urgency in recognising a Palestinian state.\n“If we look at the medium and long term, if we don’t do something differently to how we have been acting in the last decade, we will see this spiral of violence once again. And in order to do that [something different] … we need a real and valuable Palestinian state,” Albares told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. “That’s why we are going to recognise the state of Palestine.”\nAlbares also pointed out that the recognition of a Palestinian state had long been a key foreign policy commitment for Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Worker’s party (PSOE). The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, himself a former Spanish foreign minister, has also made his feelings plain when it comes to Israel’s offensive in Gaza.\n“Which are the other solutions they have in mind?” Borrell said in January. “To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them? Twenty-five thousand already in Gaza, 70% women and children. Certainly, the way of trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they are doing, because they are seeding the hate for generations.”\nDublin has been seeking to make common cause with like-minded members and has calibrated its statements to nudge, but not subvert, the EU foreign policy mainstream. As well as teaming up with Spain, Slovenia and Malta last month to express a readiness to recognise Palestinian statehood, it has partnered with Spain to prod the EU into reviewing an Israel trade deal over human rights obligations.\nLast week Ireland announced it would intervene in South Africa’s landmark international court of justice case against Israel by attempting to widen the definition of genocide to include blocking aid.\n“Clearly an entire population is being impacted here not just through the bombing but through starvation,” Martin, told the Guardian. “We’ve experienced famine, we know what it’s like in our psyche,” he said, citing the 1840s disaster known as the Great Hunger.\nMartin linked Dublin’s response to the devastation in Gaza with an Irish foreign policy tradition of seeking to curb certain weapons, such as cluster munitions, and promoting humanitarian corridors in Syria, Ethiopia and other conflicts.\nMartin said he expected Ireland’s foreign policy to remain unchanged under Simon Harris, who is due to succeed Varadkar as taoiseach next week. “We’ve worked with Simon Harris for the last four years in government, so we don’t anticipate any major issues around the content of foreign policy,” he said.\nIrish diplomats and analysts say Ireland’s colonial history has predisposed it to back the underdog. It was the first EU state to endorse Palestinian statehood in 1980. Even so, Ireland strives to remain within the EU consensus, said Niall Holohan, who served as Ireland’s representative to the Palestinian Authority from 2002 to 2006.\nIsrael has accused Dublin of giving succour to Hamas, whose 7 October attack on southern Israel triggered the war, but domestically the Irish government has faced accusations of being too soft on Israel. Opposition parties have pushed for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and proposed a law that would ban the Irish state from investing in companies that operate in illegal Israeli settlements, moves the government has resisted.\nSánchez’s erstwhile allies in the far-left Podemos party have also been forthright in their condemnation, accusing Israel of planning a “genocide” against the Palestinian people and calling for Netanyahu to be brought before the international criminal court to face war crimes charges.\nAs European and international exasperation increases, some diplomats blame the continued division in the bloc on the early unconditional support for Israel given by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, arguing it would not be at odds if she had clearly mentioned Israel’s obligation to observe human rights in her initial support of the country’s right to defend itself.\nSix months on, waiting for a change in the status quo is simply no longer an option for many. “If we wait for the 27 member states [to recognise Palestine] we will be waiting for ever,” said one senior diplomat."

    "raw_text": "The world’s leading genocide scholars’ association has backed a resolution stating that Israel’s actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of the crime.\nOut of the International Association of Genocide Scholars’s (IAGS) 500 members, 28% took part in the vote. Of those who voted, 86% supported the resolution. The resolution states that “Israel’s policies and actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of genocide in article II of the United Nations convention for the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide (1948).”\nThe three-page resolution passed by the body calls on Israel to “immediately cease all acts that constitute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity against Palestinians in Gaza, including deliberate attacks against and killing of civilians including children; starvation; deprivation of humanitarian aid, water, fuel, and other items essential to the survival of the population; sexual and reproductive violence; and forced displacement of the population.”\nThe resolution said the IAGS recognised that “since the horrific Hamas-led attack of 7 October 2023, which itself constitutes international crimes”, the government of Israel had engaged in systematic and widespread crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide, including indiscriminate and deliberate attacks against the civilians and civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, homes and commercial buildings, of Gaza.\nMelanie O’Brien, the IAGS president and a professor of international law at the University of Western Australia, said the resolution was “a definitive statement from experts in the field of genocide studies that what is going on on the ground in Gaza is genocide”.\nFounded in 1994, the IAGS has a broad membership that includes academics, historians, political scientists and human rights activists. It has adopted previous resolutions identifying genocide, including historical cases such as the Armenian genocide.\nThe 1948 UN convention, drafted in the aftermath of the Holocaust, defines genocide as acts committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”. It obliges signatory states to act to prevent and stop such crimes, which may include killing members of a group, inflicting serious harm, imposing destructive living conditions, preventing births or transferring children by force.\nThere was no immediate response from the Israeli foreign ministry.\nIsrael is fighting allegations at the world’s top court, the international court of justice, of committing genocide in Gaza. Separately, the international criminal court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant. It also issued an arrest warrant for the Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, but withdrew it after he was killed.\nAt least 31 people were killed on Monday, more than half of them women and children, as Israel launched strikes across the Gaza Strip, according to health officials.\nReuters contributed to this report"

    "raw_text": "Europe and the west’s double standards over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza threaten to undermine its global standing, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has warned, describing the response to Israel’s assault on the Palestinian territory as one of the darkest episodes of international relations in the 21st century.\nIn an interview with the Guardian before talks with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Wednesday, the socialist leader also said the US under Donald Trump was trying to end the post-second world war, rules-based global order it had originally created.\nHe defended the benefits of migration and blamed traditional rightwing parties for breaking the consensus over the response to the climate emergency by copying the policies of their populist rivals.\nSánchez – the first senior European leader to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza – said he was pleased that other European countries were following Spain’s lead in recognising a Palestinian state, but accepted Europe’s response had been poor.\n“It is a failure,” he said. “Absolutely. It is also the reality that, within the European Union, there are countries that are divided when it comes to how to influence Israel. But in my opinion, it’s not acceptable and we can’t last longer if we want to increase our credibility when it comes to other crises, such as the one we face in Ukraine.\n“The roots of these wars are completely different but, at the end of the day, the world is looking at the EU and also at western society and asking: ‘Why are you doing double standards when it comes to Ukraine and when it comes to Gaza?’”\nSpeaking as he attempts to reassert himself on the international stage and move past a series of damaging corruption allegations that have battered his administration and fuelled calls for a snap general election, Sánchez said he was pushing Europe to do more, including punishing Israel financially.\n“What we’re now witnessing in Gaza is perhaps one of the darkest episodes of international relations in the 21st century, and in this regard what I have to say is that Spain has been very vocal within the EU and also within the international community,” he said. “Within the EU, what we have done so far is advocate to suspend the strategic partnership that the EU has with Israel.”\nSanchez, who has clashed with Donald Trump over Spain’s refusal to meet the US president’s demands to spend 5% of GDP on defence, said Spain was a “reliable partner” in Nato. He said he was committed to preserving “the best relationship with the US”, regardless of who was in the White House – and despite Trump’s isolationist actions.\n“With all due respect, we have a pragmatic approach in our relationship with the US,” he said. “At the same time, I think we have a different vision on how to face the challenges that the world and our societies are facing. And I think there’s a big mistake with leaving the Paris agreement and reducing contributions to aid programmes and to the World Health Organization. But at the end of the day, our societies are facing global challenges that don’t understand borders, and we need to strengthen our cooperation and collaboration.”\nBut he also said that the US’s withdrawal from global institutions could allow others to play a greater international role.\n“The most shocking reality that we’re facing is that the principal architect of the international order – which is the US after the second world war – is now weakening this international order, and that’s something that’s not going to be positive for US society or for the rest of the world, especially western countries,” he said. “That is why I think there’s an opportunity for the European Union and also for the UK.”\nHe added that while still being loyal to the “transatlantic bond”, European countries could strengthen their power and influence – if they acted morally and consistently.\n“What does it mean? It means that we need to avoid these double standards. It means that we need to reinforce our commitment when it comes to the green pact. It means that we need to have a humanitarian and moral vision – and also a pragmatic one – when it comes to migration.”\nHe added: “In politics, as in life, when you leave a gap, there’s always someone who’s going to fill it. And I believe that that’s what we’re also witnessing when it comes to some eastern Asian countries.”\nWednesday’s meeting in London will be the first significant bilateral summit between the two countries’ leaders for more than a decade. It was made possible by the UK and Spain striking a deal over Gibraltar’s future, ending the long-running dispute over the territory after Brexit and easing the movement of people and goods across the border.\nWhile Starmer and his Labour government have taken an increasingly hard line on immigration, Sánchez has been forthright about the benefits it can bring.\n“The dilemma that western societies are facing is whether we decide to be an opening-up and growing society, or a closing-off and shrinking society,” he said. “And so far, I believe that the vast majority of citizens in Spain understand quite well that migration is also an opportunity and not only a moral duty. It’s an opportunity to respond effectively to the challenges that we are facing when it comes to economic growth and when it comes to the labour market or helping to finance our welfare state in the present and the future.”\nSánchez, who announced a 10-point plan earlier this week to help Spain mitigate the effects of the climate emergency, also warned that efforts to tackle the crisis were being undermined by rightwing parties adopting the far right’s narratives in the hope of electoral gain.\n“Of course, there’s a far right that denies the reality of the climate emergency,” he said.\n“The problem that we’re now facing is that there are traditional rightwing parties that perhaps don’t deny the scientific reality, but which act and behave as if climate change doesn’t exist. And this is the biggest problem. I think that traditional rightwing parties – not the far right – trying to transform the scientific evidence on climate change into ideological and political struggles is the biggest mistake that rightwing parties are committing. And this is something we’re facing in Spain.”\nHe was speaking after the UK Conservative party said it will aim to “maximise extraction” of oil and gas in the North Sea if it wins power, copying Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” election slogan.\nSánchez, whose party, administration and family have faced a slew of damaging corruption allegations over recent months that have threatened to topple his minority government, said he was committed to cracking down on graft, and to transparency.\nAsked whether he had confidence in Spain’s justice system given his claims that his wife is the victim of a rightwing and far-right judicial smear campaign, he said: “The large majority of judges in Spain fulfil their obligations and do their jobs … But there are some judges that are playing politics, and that’s a reality we’re facing not only in Spain but also in many other democracies – especially when it comes to progressive forces or progressive governments.”\nSánchez said his minority government was delivering economically and socially and would continue to do so. “Of course these corruption scandals were very difficult for us to accept, but the political project is broader, and I think the most important message that I’d like to explain to my citizens is that the direction of the country that we started seven years ago is the correct one, and it’s not an abstract one,” he said.\nHe said the opposition parties offered no real alternative, only “a regression”, adding: “What we’re witnessing in Spain is the political collapse of the traditional party, not only in substance, but also in style, because it’s copying the far right.”"

Back then, having been in office for just six months, Spain’s socialist prime minister could afford to mock his opponents’ frequently hyperbolic attempts to depict him and his administration as an existential threat to the country.\n“I know you think I’m a dangerous, extreme leftwinger who’s trying to break Spain apart,” he told the senate at the end of October that year. “I know that everything I do, and everything my government does, is illegal, immoral and even fattening.”\nAlmost seven years on, that barb hasn’t aged well. The EU’s last centre-left leader is fighting the most crucial battle of his political life. The events of the past seven days – and, indeed the past year – have battered the reputation of Spain’s socialist-led minority government and of the man who came to power as a self-declared scourge of corruption.\nSánchez, 53, made Spanish political history in June 2018 when he became the first opposition leader to successfully use a motion of no confidence to oust a sitting government and become prime minister. By then, the conservative People’s party (PP) had been in power for seven years, was mired in graft scandals and had just been irreparably damaged by a court’s ruling that the party had profited from an illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme. Its then leader, Mariano Rajoy, had also suffered the ignominy of becoming the first serving Spanish prime minister to give evidence in a criminal trial.\nUnveiling his no-confidence motion, Sánchez complained that the PP had “seriously damaged the health of our democracy” and plunged the country’s politics into what he termed a “corruption thriller”.\nIt is another phrase that hasn’t aged well. Today it is his government and his circle that sit at the centre of a web of alleged plots that would seem too numerous, too unlikely and too convoluted for an airport novel.\nThe question now is whether the great survivor of Spanish politics will make it to the next general election, scheduled for 2027.\nTo mangle Hemingway’s line on going bankrupt, how does a government slide into ethical and electoral insolvency? “Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.”\nLast week, Sánchez’s right-hand man, Santos Cerdán, the organisational secretary of the prime minister’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), resigned after a supreme court judge found “firm evidence” of his possible involvement in taking kickbacks on public construction contracts. His case is tied to those of two other men, the former transport minister José Luis Ábalos – who was Cerdán’s predecessor as the PSOE’s organisational secretary – and Ábalos’s former aide Koldo García.\nÁbalos was sacked from Sánchez’s cabinet in 2021 and suspended by the PSOE in February last year after refusing to resign when García was accused of taking bribes to facilitate mask contracts during the Covid crisis. Both men have denied any wrongdoing.\nOver the past few days, leaked evidence handed to the Guardia Civil’s anti-corruption unit has purported to show Cerdán discussing kickbacks with Ábalos and García, and Cerdán instructing García to interfere with the 2014 party vote that saw Sánchez elected PSOE leader. Audio of a crude discussion between Ábalos and García in which they appear to discuss the various attributes of different sex workers has also surfaced.\nIt’s little wonder then that Sánchez proclaimed on Thursday of last week that he should never have trusted Cerdán, who insists he is innocent. The prime minister’s accompanying mea culpa – “I have many shortcomings … but I have always believed in working for clean politics and fair play in politics” – came hours after the PSOE had denied that Cerdán had ever been involved in any conversations about taking bribes.\nThose cases are not the only graft allegations facing those around the prime minister. Both Sánchez’s wife, Begoña Gómez, and his brother, David Sánchez, are also under investigation.\nGómez is being investigated for alleged corruption and influence-peddling after a complaint by the pressure group Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), a self-styled trade union with far-right links that has a long history of using the courts to pursue political targets. Manos Limpias has accused Gómez of using her influence as the wife of the prime minister to secure sponsors for a university master’s degree course that she ran. Sánchez has complained of being the victim of “lawfare” and has described the case against his wife as baseless and “an ugly fit-up driven by the far-right groups behind the complaint”. The emergence of the allegations last year led him to take a five-day break from his public duties while he considered whether to carry on as prime minister.\nDavid Sánchez, meanwhile, is facing trial over allegations of influence-peddling and other offences in a case that also began with accusations from Manos Limpias and other groups. He denies the charges.\nIt doesn’t end there. A former PSOE member has been accused of trying to wage a smear campaign against the Guardia Civil anti-corruption unit, which is also investigating Gómez and David Sánchez. And Spain’s top prosecutor could face trial for allegedly leaking confidential information from a tax fraud case involving the partner of Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the populist PP leader of the Madrid region who is also one of Pedro Sánchez’s loudest and brashest critics.\nNo degree in political science is needed to see just how bad things are for the PSOE. Sánchez’s big worry now is that there could be still more damaging revelations to come about the activities of the “toxic triangle” of Cerdán, Ábalos and García. On Friday morning, Guardia Civil officers visited the PSOE’s Madrid HQ and the transport ministry to clone Cerdán and Ábalos’s email accounts.\nAlthough the PP, now led by Alberto Núñez Feijóo, doesn’t yet have the votes it needs to bring a no-confidence vote against the government, the PSOE’s parliamentary allies – who include small Basque and Catalan nationalist parties – could decide that the socialist brand is too radioactive for them to be associated with.\nIn the meantime, Sánchez, a politician known for confounding expectations and opponents – and a man who famously called his 2019 memoir Manual de Resistencia (Resistance Manual) – is insisting that the PSOE is not institutionally rotten.\n“I will not allow you to turn an anecdote into a category,” he told his adversaries during a loud and rancorous session in congress on Wednesday. “The left is not corrupt.”\nThe PP, which believes it may finally have Sánchez cornered, is not without its own issues. Ayuso – whose eccentric pronouncements tend to eclipse Feijóo’s more muted leadership style – is still under pressure over her boyfriend’s judicial issues with the tax authorities, and over her government’s Covid protocols after more than 7,200 people died in the region’s care homes during the early stages of the Covid pandemic.\nThe party is also facing continuing scrutiny over its response to last year’s deadly floods in Valencia, another of the regions it governs. Then there is its own well-documented history of corruption, not to mention the inconvenient fact that the PP is all but certain to have to rely on a deal with the far-right Vox party to govern.\nBut there is a growing sense that what was supposed to be one of Europe’s few remaining beacons of social democracy is dimming, even as the far right is gaining strength around the continent and beyond. If successive conservative and socialist governments in Spain are brought down by corruption scandals, the big winners are likely to be those, such as Vox, who rage against what they say is an old and rotten two-party system.\nRecent events over the border in Portugal are also sobering. In last month’s snap election, the Portuguese socialist party – which was forced from government by a corruption scandal in 2023 – finished third behind the far-right Chega party. While a similar outcome in Spain is deeply improbable, Vox’s appeal – especially to young men – is increasing.\nAs the accusations mount, the achievements of the Sánchez administration risk disappearing under the rapidly accumulating weight of mud.\nAs well as delivering an enviably strong economy and calming the tensions in Catalonia after the failed 2017 push for independence, the government has, in conjunction with its successive, more leftwing partners, introduced menstrual leave, a minimum basic income scheme, a euthanasia law and updated abortion legislation.\nPerhaps most eye-catchingly of all, Sánchez has also bucked the continent-wide political trend by defending immigration and its benefits.\n“Spain needs to choose between being an open and prosperous country or a closed-off, poor country,” he told parliament in October. “It’s as simple as that.”\nThe coming weeks will determine the prime minister’s future, but some believe the days of the Sánchez government are numbered.\n“As I see it, the legislature is already over,” said Pablo Simón, a political scientist at Madrid’s Carlos III University. While he acknowledged his view might sound harsh, he said the recent revelations were damaging precisely because they struck at the very heart of the PSOE’s progressive and administrative credibility.\nSimón said the allegations of irregularities in the PSOE primaries, the apparent use of sex workers – “which breaks that whole image of a feminist government that believes in equality” – the perceived hypocrisy of a party that professed a zero tolerance approach to corruption, and Sánchez’s repeated cries of lawfare and conspiracy, now added up to a damning whole.\n“With those four corners of the government’s narrative demolished, the situation is now terminal,” he said. “We don’t know how the legislature will end or when it will end, but we’re now in the final countdown … No one knows exactly what else could come out.”"

    "raw_text": "The leftwing junior partners in Spain’s socialist-led coalition government have called on the interior ministry to cancel a €6.6m (£5.7m) order for millions of bullets from an Israeli company, claiming the deal breaches coalition agreements and undermines efforts to hold Israel to account over its actions in Gaza.\nSpain’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has been one of the most outspoken critics of Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza, questioning whether it is following international humanitarian law and calling the number of Palestinian deaths “truly unbearable”.\nIn October last year, the interior ministry announced it had cancelled the purchase of 15.3m bullets from an Israeli company because of the government’s “commitment to neither buying weapons from, nor selling weapons to, the state of Israel following the outbreak of armed conflict in Gaza”.\nBut it emerged on Wednesday that the purchase of the 9mm ammunition, which had been ordered on behalf of the Guardia Civil police force, was going ahead because the interior ministry had decided the contract was too far advanced and too expensive to cancel.\nThe apparent U-turn prompted an angry response from the Sumar platform, which was founded by Yolanda Díaz, Spain’s labour minister and one of the country’s three deputy prime ministers.\nThe platform described the contract as a “flagrant breach” of the commitments made within the government on suspending the buying of weapons from Israel and demanded its immediate cancellation. It also called on the socialist interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, to appear before MPs to explain what had happened.\n“Our commitment to the Palestinian people is absolute,” the platform said in a statement. “That is why we have repeatedly called for a total embargo on the purchase of weapons from Israeli, for the breaking off of diplomatic relations with Israel, for the imposition of sanctions, and for the international criminal court to be supported in the arrest warrants it has issued for [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and other members of his government and the Israeli army.”\nOthers within Sumar went further. Antonio Maíllo, the federal coordinator of the platform’s United Left group, said he and his colleagues would not tolerate “any part of the executive financing a genocidal state” and said the issue had provoked the worst crisis to date between Sumar and the socialists.\nNews that the contract would proceed came a day after Sumar dismissed Sánchez’s plans to invest €10.5bn to enable Spain to reach its long-delayed Nato commitment of spending 2% of its GDP on defence as “incoherent” and “absolutely exorbitant”.\nSources at the interior ministry said the department began looking into annulling the contract six months ago and decided to proceed with it on legal advice.\n“Annulling the contract would have meant paying the company for the order without receiving the agreed materials, which are needed so that the Guardia Civil can fulfil its duties,” the sources said.\nDespite the contract in question, they insisted the interior ministry shared the government’s commitment to not selling weapons to, or buying weapons from, Israel."

    "raw_text": "More than 132,000 descendants of the Jews expelled from Spain in the late 15th century have applied for Spanish citizenship under a law intended to make amends for the mass exile.\nThe law, introduced four years ago, was designed to atone for the “historical wrong” that saw the country’s Jewish community expelled, forced to convert to Catholicism or burned at the stake.\nAfter being extended for a year, the law lapsed on 1 October. According to the justice ministry, 132,226 people of Sephardic descent applied for Spanish citizenship before the deadline, with a huge rise in applications in the past month.\n“By 31 August, 60,226 applications had been received, but in September alone, almost 72,000 were received, most of them from citizens in Latin American countries, mainly Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela,” the ministry said in a statement.\nThe Spanish government had initially estimated that around 90,000 people would seek citizenship, but acknowledged that it was hard to know just how many people would meet the criteria.\nSpain’s Federation of Jewish Communities (FCJE), which certifies applications, said it had received more than 30,000 from Mexico, 26,000 from Colombia, 14,000 from Venezuela, 7,000 from Argentina, 5,400 from the US and 4,900 from Israel.\nIt has also dealt with applications from Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Turkey, France, the UK, Serbia and Montenegro, Peru, Chile, Morocco and Afghanistan.\nAlthough the process does not require applicants to be practising Jews or to be resident in Spain, it is long, complicated and expensive.\nAs well as taking tests in Spanish language and culture, applicants needed to prove their Sephardic heritage, establish or prove a special connection with Spain, and then pay a designated notary to certify their documents.\nIsaac Querub, the president of the FCJE, said the law had finally achieved its aims.\n“Thousands of Sephardic Jews from all over the world have recovered their Spanish nationality and thousands more are in the process of doing so,” he said.\n“Spain has used a long-lasting legal act to close a historical wound. Sephardic Jews are no longer ‘the Jews without a homeland’. Spain came to miss them and the Sephardic Jews never forgot Spain.”\nA similar law was approved in Portugal in 2015 to atone for the expulsions from that part of the Iberian peninsula.\n“There is no possibility to amend what was done,” the Portuguese government said at the time, adding that the law represented “an attribution of a right”.\nBrexit has fuelled a huge increase in the number of applications for Portuguese citizenship.\nThe Jewish Community of Oporto – which, along with the Lisbon Jewish community, certifies applicants – said it had received just five applications before the Brexit referendum compared with 400 in the two months following the vote.\nThe Jewish Federation of New Mexico also recorded a spike in applications following the election of Donald Trump as president.\n“Before the election, we issued maybe 20 or 30 certificates,” Sara Koplik, the federation’s director of community outreach, told the Guardian last year.\n“But we have now issued 1,500 – from multiple countries.”\nWhile the federation has dealt with applications from more than 50 countries, the majority come from the US, Mexico and Venezuela.\n“It’s a big jump and of course some of it had nothing to do with the United States – it has to do with Venezuela and violence in Mexico – but for Americans, they see this as an insurance policy just in case, against hatred,” said Koplik."

    "raw_text": "The Israeli government has recalled its ambassador in Madrid and said it will be reprimanding Spain’s top diplomat in Tel Aviv after the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said he had “genuine doubts” about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law in its offensive in Gaza.\nSánchez’s latest remarks came a week after he caused a diplomatic spat by using a visit to Israel to urge it to rethink its operations in Gaza, claiming its response to Hamas’s atrocitieson 7 October could not “imply the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”.\nSpeaking to Spain’s state broadcaster, TVE, on Thursday morning, Sánchez repeated his condemnation of Hamas’s attacks but said “friendly countries really have to be able to tell each other things”.\n“We’ve said from the very beginning that what Hamas did in Israel is absolutely atrocious and abominable,” he said, adding that he had watched 20 minutes of “very tough” footage of the attacks during last week’s meeting with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“We’ve also always shown our public commitment to Hamas having to free all the hostages they hold immediately and without any conditions whatsoever,” Sánchez said.\n“But we have to tell Israel, with the same conviction, that its actions must be based on international humanitarian law. But with the images we’re seeing and the growing number of people – especially boys and girls – who are being killed, I have genuine doubts that they’re complying with international humanitarian law.”\nThe Spanish leader said a political solution to the crisis required “the recognition of the Palestinian state”, adding: “It’s in Europe’s interest to address this issue out of moral conviction because what we are seeing in Gaza is not acceptable.”\nSpain has already indicated it could be willing to unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state if other EU members fail to do so collectively.\nHis words met with a furious response from the Israeli government. Netanyahu said he had instructed his foreign minister, Eli Cohen, to call in Spain’s ambassador for a reprimand “after the shameful statement by the Spanish prime minister”. He also noted that the comments had come on a day when Hamas gunmen murdered three people and injured 13 others in East Jerusalem.\nCohen said Sánchez’s “outrageous words” had prompted him to call the Israeli ambassador in Madrid to return for consultations.\nHe added: “Israel acts and will continue to act according to international law and we will continue the war until the release of all the abductees and the elimination of Hamas in Gaza.”\nDuring last week’s joint visit to the region with Belgium’s prime minister, Alexander De Croo, Sánchez said the number of dead Palestinians was “truly unbearable” and reiterated that the creation of a Palestinian state remained the best way to bring peace and security to the region. De Croo said Israel’s military operation needed to respect international humanitarian law, adding: “The killing of civilians needs to stop.”\nThe pair’s comments led the Israeli foreign ministry to accuse them of “giving support to terrorism” and to summon the ambassadors of both countries.\nSpain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, called the Israeli government’s comments “false, misplaced and unacceptable”.\nSánchez also dismissed the criticism, saying: “Condemning the vile terrorist attacks of a terrorist group like Hamas, and at the same condemning the indiscriminate killing of Palestinians in Gaza, is not a question of political parties nor of ideology, it is a question of being humane.”\nRelations between Spain and Israel have been fraught over recent weeks after some far-left members of Sánchez’s previous cabinet criticised Israel’s reaction to the terrorist atrocities, suggesting it was committing war crimes in Gaza and calling for Netanyahu to be brought before the international criminal court.\nIsrael’s embassy in Madrid described the remarks as “deeply immoral” and accused some Spanish MPs of aligning themselves with “Isis-style terrorism”.\nSpain responded with its own strongly worded statement that accused the Israeli embassy of “spreading falsehoods” about some cabinet members.\n“In a full democracy, such as Spain, any political leader can freely express their positions as the representative of a political party,” the statement from the foreign ministry said.\n“In any case, the Spanish government’s position on the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas is clear: unequivocal condemnation; demands for the immediate and unconditional release of the hostages, and the recognition of Israel to defend itself within the limits set by international law and international humanitarian law.”\nAt least 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage when Hamas fighters crossed the border from Gaza on 7 October, according to Israeli figures. According to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, about 15,000 people, 40% of them children, have been killed in Israel’s retaliatory strikes."

    "raw_text": "The US’s refusal to grant visas to the Palestinian delegation to the UN general assembly has led to calls for a one-day conference on a two-state solution for Palestine and Israel to be moved from the UN’s headquarters in New York to its other main site in Geneva.\nDonald Trump’s White House has already refused to grant a visa to the Palestinian Authority (PA) president, Mahmoud Abbas, and 80 other Palestinian officials for the general assembly session, which begins on Tuesday.\nThere is now speculation that, citing anti-terrorist laws, he will also ban diplomats from Brazil, Iran, Sudan and Zimbabwe.\nIn 1988 the US debarred the leader of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Yasser Arafat, from travelling to New York.\nBut the White House is going further than before by withholding visas from the entire travelling Palestinian delegation to probably the most important diplomatic event for Palestine since the Oslo accords – a one-day event at which the UK, France, Australia, Canada and others are expected to recognise a Palestinian state if certain conditions are met, which has infuriated Israel.\nSuch a blanket ban has never been attempted in the history of the UN. Per Clausen, a Danish MEP who is a member of the Left group, has called for Europe to propose a temporary transfer to Geneva “both to uphold the Palestinians’ right to be represented and to send a clear signal to Trump”.\nIn a statement at the end of August, the US state department said: “It is in our national security interests to hold the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and the Palestinian Authority accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace.”\nIt added that, to be considered partners for peace, both groups “must consistently repudiate terrorism, and end incitement to terrorism in education, as required by US law and as promised by the PLO”.\nIt also called on the PA to end its attempts to bypass negotiations through international “lawfare” campaigns, including appeals to the international criminal court and to the international court of justice, and efforts to secure the unilateral recognition of a conjectural Palestinian state.\nThe state department argued: “Both steps materially contributed to Hamas’s refusal to release its hostages, and to the breakdown of the Gaza ceasefire talks.”\nThe Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, said Abbas had planned to lead the delegation to the UN meetings and was expected to address the general assembly at the high-level general debate, which begins on 23 September.\nAbbas was also expected to attend a delayed meeting co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia on 22 September about a two-state solution.\nA group of states will formally recognise the state of Palestine on that day, and Abbas was due to make a series of commitments about PA’s support for exclusively peaceful means to resolve the conflict with Israel.\nAbbas was due to meet the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Monday evening to discuss the plans for a reformed Palestinian leadership.\nPalestine is an observer member of the UN, meaning it can speak at meetings but not vote on resolutions.\nUnder a 1947 UN agreement, the US is generally required to allow access for foreign diplomats to the UN in New York. Previously in 2019 the US restricted the areas that the Iranian diplomat Javad Zarif was allowed to visit next to the UN headquarters and the Iranian permanent mission.\nWashington has said it can deny visas for security, extremism and foreign policy reasons.\nFor Brazil, it was not clear if any potential visa restrictions would affect the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva or lower-level members of the country’s delegation to the UN gathering.\nBrazil’s president is traditionally the first world leader to speak before the gathered officials on the opening day of the session. The US president is by precedent the second speaker.\nLula has been a target of Trump, who objects to the prosecution of the former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally accused of leading an attempted coup."

    "raw_text": "Britain is not just complicit in Israel’s breaches of humanitarian law in Gaza but a participant that has repeatedly ignored its legal obligation to prevent a genocide, witnesses have told the independent Gaza tribunal.\nThe two-day tribunal in London, which is independent of government and parliament, is seeking to amass evidence of Britain’s failure to distance itself from what the tribunal organisers regard as Israeli war crimes amounting to genocide.\nIt is chaired by Jeremy Corbyn, who claimed the 29 witnesses had “paved the way for truth” and promised he would demand a meeting with the foreign secretary to present the report he will now compile with two legal experts.\nThe second and final day of evidence, given mainly by experts supportive of Palestine, painted a picture of a government that has done the minimum to hold Israel to account and the maximum to shield itself from parliamentary and judicial scrutiny. The concern for government is that the evidence becomes a widely believed charge sheet against ministers as Israel resists all compromise in its fight against Hamas.\nAmong the allegations made were that:\n-\nRAF pilots flying from the UK Akrotiri airbase in Cyprus systematically shared intelligence in real time with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), but not with the international criminal court.\n-\nNo 10 failed to provide the support requested by lawyers acting for James Henderson, the British World Central Kitchen aid worker killed by the IDF on 1 April 2024, leaving them reliant on an IDF internal investigation, with a coroners’ inquiry still as long as two years away.\n-\nBritain provided no support to the chief prosecutor at the international criminal court, Karim Khan, after the US government imposed sanctions that led a British bank to close his account, “so emboldening those who seek to dismantle international accountability”.\n-\nThe UK trade department continued to allow the import of products from Israel-occupied territories after the international court of justice in July 2024 ruled in an advisory opinion that the occupation was unlawful.\nForz Khan, a lawyer acting for the family of Henderson, said: “The Henderson family want to know what the full picture is. He went out there in good faith, yet he was for some unknown reason murdered, picked off in a military fashion. An internal IDF investigation found that it was a mistake. Our case is that it was a deliberate murder.”\nKhan also claimed that when the Henderson family were finally given a meeting with ministers, their lawyers were prevented from attending.\nHenderson was killed when an Israeli airstrike targeted a clearly marked vehicle. The Israeli inquiry led to the dismissal of two officers. An inquiry by the IDF found a drone operator mistakenly targeted the convoy after thinking it had been taken over by Hamas gunmen.\nSome of the most damaging evidence was given by Charlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a lawyer acting for the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq in the UK court challenge into the handling of arms exports controls to Israel.\nShe said evidence revealed in the case that the UK Foreign Office passed all allegations of war crimes to Israel “setting in motion a circular reasoning, which saw the government repeatedly give perpetrators of these atrocities the opportunity not to incriminate themselves”.\nBy September 2024, the last time Al-Haq lawyers had disclosure in court, 40,000 Palestinians had been killed and 10,000 airstrikes launched. However, the UK government had examined 413 cases, and lawyers had found the only possible violation of international law involving World Central Kitchen.\n“That meant, 11 months into this deadly war, the UK government had not found a single incident that exclusively killed Palestinians and had been a possible violation of international law.”\nThe Israeli government says it does not target children or civilians, but says its task is made harder by Hamas, which carried out the 7 October 2023 attacks and still holds Israeli hostages, embedding itself among the civilian population.\nMark Smith, a diplomat who quit his Foreign Office job over the UK’s refusal to stop selling arms to Israel in August 2024, said civil servants who challenged the IDF’s methods were routinely pressed to tone down their findings “so it sounded less bad”.\n“Thousands of conversations within the walls of the Foreign Office on the most controversial aspects of our arms sales policy will never be seen by the public [and] never be put to a court because they were held in person,” he said."

    "raw_text": "In recent photos, Jana Ayyad is curled up in a ball, her face covered with her hands. Sometimes, the emaciated eight-year-old sobs, crying out for her father, who has been marooned outside Gaza since the war started 23 months ago.\nJana is on the brink of death. Her only hope is a medical evacuation from Gaza so that she can receive treatment abroad.\nHer health crisis started with severe malnutrition and has since led to complications such as severe acidosis – where body fluids contain too much acid because the kidneys and lungs can’t keep the body’s pH in balance, and which doctors say they do not have the supplies to treat. Over the last month, her body has begun to swell, a hallmark of malnutrition and acidosis.\n“The doctor told me bluntly: ‘Your daughter’s condition is bad; at any moment you could lose her,’” said Nesma Ayyad, Jana’s mother. Two months ago, Jana’s two--year-old sister Joury was taken to hospital after suddenly developing a sickness that meant her skin peeled and bled. Within a month she had died. Ayyad fears that without urgent action, Jana will suffer the same fate.\nIsrael controls who enters and leaves Gaza, and people who need medical treatment abroad must have their exit approved by Cogat, the Israeli military agency in charge of humanitarian affairs for Palestinians. Palestinians must pass a security check by Israel and also locate a country willing to take them in.\nOfficials said that they applied for Jana’s medical evacuation to Jordan two weeks ago, but are still waiting for approval from Israel. Jana’s case was submitted along with 10 other children who are seeking medical evacuation, but Israel has only cleared two children from the batch so far, an official involved in the process said.\nIn a statement, Cogat said it had not received a request for Jana’s medical evacuation.\nDr Musab Farwana, one of the doctors treating Jana at the Patients’ Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza, said: “Jana’s condition is deteriorating and we are fighting against the circumstances, trying as much as possible with the very limited resources available to keep her alive until she can be evacuated. Without an urgent transfer, we sadly expect that she could die at any moment.”\nThough urgent, Jana’s case is not unique in Gaza. She is one of more than 16,000 people who are waiting for medical treatment abroad, according to statistics from the Gaza ministry of health in August.\nIsrael’s punishing war on Gaza has left more than 150,000 wounded, while its systematic destruction of the territory and its civilian infrastructure has spread disease among the densely packed population. Its continued blockade on aid into Gaza, which has created a famine according to the world’s leading authority on food crises, has left doctors without the means to treat the sick and famished.\nThe most critical cases receive referrals in order to receive treatment abroad, but doctors and medical authorities say that most requests are delayed indefinitely. According to the World Health Organization in December, the pace of medical evacuations out of Gaza was so slow that it would take up to 10 years to clear the list of referrals.\nJana’s doctors say they have neither the tools to diagnose her nor the medical supplies to treat her. “Most of the required lab tests were unavailable, even blood acidity tests,” said Farwana. “If basic tests are not available, how can we conduct the complex tests that are essential to identify her condition and the cause of the illness?” He added that Jana needs a specialised milk formula without protein, but the one they could find for her was about to run out.\nDuring more than a year of being stuck in hospital, Jana’s physical and mental state has deteriorated. Her hair has fallen out, she has lost the ability to walk and her weight has dropped to 9kg (20lbs). She spends most of her days staring blankly into space, depressed.\n“Jana used to have a strong personality. She loved playing with dolls, drawing colouring and writing,” said Ayyad. “She dreamed of becoming a dentist and always told me she would give me a beautiful smile when she became one. Since falling ill, she hasn’t been able to do any of these things.”\nOn Tuesday, during a medical examination, she turned to her mother and asked her: “Am I going to die now?” Neither her mother nor the doctor knew how to respond.\nJana has appeared in the media over the last 18 months as her condition has steadily worsened. Despite the global attention, she has not been able to leave Gaza nor get the treatment she needs.\nHaving exhausted all options and faced with a seemingly endless series of forms and bureaucratic hurdles required to prevent her child’s looming death, Jana’s mother feels as if her pleas are falling on deaf ears.\nAyyad said: “I know nothing about the evacuation process except that they spoke to me and told me that the referral procedures are going well, but until now nothing has changed. Why is Jana’s case so complicated? Why can no one in the world get her out of Gaza?”"

    "raw_text": "The US has imposed sanctions against three Palestinian human rights groups that asked the international criminal court (ICC) to investigate Israel over allegations of genocide in Gaza, according to a notice posted to the US treasury department’s website.\nThe three groups – the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights and Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Ramallah-based Al-Haq – were listed under what the treasury department said were ICC-related designations.\nThe groups are leading rights monitors in Palestine and have been engaged in documenting alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza over the past 23 months. Sanctions will make it harder for international human rights organisations to cooperate with the groups, and will make day-to-day life more difficult for their employees.\nThe US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said sanctions were imposed on the rights monitors for having “directly engaged in efforts by the international criminal court to investigate, arrest, detain or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel’s consent”.\nDays earlier, the world’s leading genocide scholars’ association said Israel’s actions in Gaza met the legal definition of genocide, an accusation Israel has denied.\nThe groups asked the ICC in November 2023 to investigate Israeli airstrikes on densely populated civilian areas of Gaza, the siege of the territory and displacement of the population.\nSince filing the lawsuit, the humanitarian conditions in Gaza have worsened significantly, with the territory facing a starvation crisis and more than 80% of its infrastructure destroyed by Israeli bombing. At that point, nearly 10,000 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza – the number of dead is now more than 64,000.\nTwo weeks ago, an Israeli strike on Nasser hospital in southern Gaza that killed 22 people, including five journalists, raised further questions about Israel’s conduct in the strip.\nAn investigation released by the Associated Press on Friday cast doubt on Israel’s explanation that its forces had struck a position that was well known as a journalists’ gathering point because they believed a camera on the roof was being used by Hamas to observe troops. The AP said it had gathered new evidence indicating the camera in question actually belonged to a Reuters video journalist who was killed in the initial strike.\nThe agency noted it had repeatedly informed the army its journalists were stationed there, and that its investigation showed that troops used high-explosive tank shells to strike the hospital, instead of more precise guided weapons that might have resulted in fewer casualties.\nIt said that soon after the first strike, Israeli forces had hit the same position again, after medical and emergency workers had reached the scene to treat the injured. The timing was reminiscent of the “double-tap” technique used by al-Qaida and by forces of the former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and others.\nThe three rights organisations released a joint statement condemning the sanctions, which they described as “immoral, illegal and undemocratic”.\nIn their 2023 lawsuit, the three Palestinian groups asked the court to examine factors including Israel’s bombing of densely populated areas in Gaza and prevention of aid into the territory, claiming the actions amounted to crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide.\nA year later, the ICC issued arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant, as well as a Hamas leader, Ibrahim al-Masri, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nNetanyahu’s office denounced the warrants as “antisemitic” and said Israel “utterly rejects the false and absurd charges”.\nDonald Trump’s administration has imposed sanctions against ICC judges as well as its chief prosecutor over the Israeli arrest warrants and a past decision to open a case into alleged war crimes by US troops in Afghanistan.\nThe ICC, which was established in 2002, has jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in its 125 member countries. Some nations, including the US, China, Russia and Israel, do not recognise its authority.\nDespite 124 countries being obliged to carry out the arrest warrants, in practice, states such as Hungary have not arrested Netanyahu when he visited.\nIsrael also faces a case at the international court of justice brought by South Africa, which alleges that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Unlike the ICC, rulings from the ICJ are not legally binding but instead are used to inform the UN security council.\nIn an interim judgment in January 2024, the ICJ ruled that the claim of genocide was “plausible” and ordered Israel to stop acts of genocide and to allow more aid into Gaza. A final ruling is not expected until 2027 at the earliest.\nIsrael has almost entirely ignored the ICJ’s provisional measures and has reduced the amount of aid let into the territory since the ruling.\nIsrael launched its assault on the Gaza Strip in October 2023, after fighters from Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in control of the territory, attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages back into Gaza.\nSince then, Israel’s war has killed 64,000 people, forced most of Gaza’s population to flee their homes at least once, and set off a starvation crisis in parts of the territory that a global hunger monitor described as a famine."

    "raw_text": "In 1980 when Leonid Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union and Donald Trump was a property developer, the nine leaders of the then European Community made their first major foray into joint diplomacy. The cause: the Middle East, including a Palestinian state.\n“The time has come to promote the recognition and implementation of two principles universally accepted by the international community: the right to existence and to security of all states in the region, including Israel … [and] recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” stated the Venice declaration calling for Palestinian self-determination.\nMore than 45 years and many hand-wringing declarations later, the EU has been castigated for its inability to play a role in bringing peace to the Middle East or even to respond to one of the world’s most glaring humanitarian crises.\nEurope’s response to Gaza has been a failure, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said this week. Striking a similar note, Slovenia’s president, Nataša Pirc Musar, described Israel’s policy as “genocidal” and questioned how some politicians, including in EU countries, could tolerate displacement, destruction of homes and acute shortages of essentials for Palestinians in Gaza.\nAnd in an exceptional rebuke, 209 former EU ambassadors and diplomatic staff wrote to EU leaders last month to voice “profound disappointment” that no substantive measures had been taken by the bloc to put pressure on Israel to end its brutal war on Gaza.\nAs European leaders face pressure to act, this month’s UN general assembly (UNGA) may be another moment that showcases Europe’s divisions over Israel, including the question of Palestinian recognition.\nFrance, the UK, Canada and Australia have signalled their intention to recognise Palestine at the UNGA, which would be a powerful symbolic move by three G7 countries and two UN permanent security council members.\nAbout a third of EU countries already recognise Palestine. The first group of these includes several central and eastern European countries that did so in 1988 under the orbit of the Soviet Union, including Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. The group includes Hungary, which today is led by Viktor Orbán, one of the staunchest defenders in Europe of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.\nWhile Czechoslovakia was part of this group, the Czech Republic describes the 1988 statement as “a political act due to the politics and organisation of international relations at the time”. Prague says it supports a two-state solution, but does not recognise Palestine nor intend to “unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state”.\nA second group consists of western EU member states that recognised Palestine in response to Israeli policy and actions in recent years. Sweden recognised a Palestinian state in 2014, soon after a Social Democrat government was elected with the support of pro-Palestinian Greens and a leftwing party. Ireland, Spain and (non-EU) Norway took the decision in May 2024 in response to Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, seeking to keep alive a two-state solution.\nSoon they will be joined by France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Malta. Emmanuel Macron announced in July that France would recognise Palestine “true to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”. This week Belgium became the latest EU country to declare it would recognise Palestine, after complex negotiations nearly tipped its five-party government into crisis. As part of the compromise, Belgium’s royal decree on recognition will not be issued until the last Israeli hostage held by Hamas is released.\nAs the Belgian debate revealed, Israel’s war on Gaza has roiled European politics, dividing parties and shaking fragile governments. The Dutch government has ruled out recognition for now but lost its foreign minister, Caspar Veldkamp, a former ambassador to Israel, who quit the caretaker government in August over his coalition partners’ veto on tougher sanctions against Israel. Finland has also declined to recognise Palestine, amid splits on the issue between the country’s president and prime minister, although both are members of the same centre-right party.\nMartin Konečný, the director of the European Middle East Project, a Brussels-based NGO, argues that Palestinian recognition is a significant step but risks becoming an empty gesture without pressure on Israel to change course over the destruction of Gaza and the construction of illegal settlements in the West Bank.\n“If you are recognising Palestine and want the Palestinian state to exist then you need to couple it with pressure on the Israeli government which is currently doing everything to destroy Palestine on the ground,” he said. “[The Israeli government] is destroying, physically, Gaza and it is expanding settlements in such a way in the West Bank that is making the two-state solution … impossible, so Palestine is being wiped off the map and that’s not an exaggeration.”\nNearly two years after Israel launched its retaliation for the 7 October attacks, when Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, the EU has not taken any measures against the Netanyahu government. In nearly 23 months, Israel has killed more than 63,700 people and inflicted a human-made famine on Gaza. The EU foreign policy service concluded in June that Israel was breaching human rights obligations and later outlined possible sanctions. The European Commission has proposed arguably the mildest possible measure – a partial suspension of Israel from the EU’s research programme. Yet this has failed to find the necessary majority, with Germany and Italy declining to support the move.\nSven Kühn von Burgsdorff, who until 2023 was the EU’s representative to the Palestinian territory, having also served as its envoy in Jerusalem, has concluded that for now there will be no EU collective response on Gaza. He helped organise the recent diplomats’ letter to EU leaders, the third in a series, urging action against the Israeli government.\nThe latest letter, sent in August, called on European countries to take individual action against Israel, such as banning weapons sales, ceasing cooperation with Israeli universities, ending trade in goods and services from illegal settlements and sanctioning human rights violators where possible. The letter continued to urge common EU sanctions, although Kühn von Burgsdorff thinks the EU is stuck for now.\nHe told the Guardian that individual member states should work outside EU formats, joining forces with countries in the global south. “I am seeing a configuration whereby the EU becomes less relevant on the Gaza file and coalitions of the willing across the regions will have more impact,” he said."

    "raw_text": "The president of Israel will travel to London next week amid outcry from Labour MPs who have urged Keir Starmer not to meet the visiting delegation.\nThe arrival of Isaac Herzog is fraught with complication for ministers, with the UK government on the brink of recognising the state of Palestine at the UN general assembly.\nHerzog is expected in the UK on Wednesday and Thursday – the first time a senior Israeli leader has been in Britain since the foreign secretary, David Lammy, met his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, on an unannounced visit in the spring.\nA foreign leader of such seniority would normally expect to spend time with high-ranking government ministers, but any meeting between Herzog and Starmer would be controversial within Labour amid Israel’s military action in Gaza.\nNo 10 has not confirmed any meeting between Herzog and the prime minister, and there are precedents for him not to do so, with Starmer having recently avoided a meeting with Bangladesh’s chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus.\nDowning Street sources suggested no appointments would be confirmed with any minister until next week.\nHowever, on Friday, the trade minister defended the prospect of government members meeting Herzog. Douglas Alexander told Sky News: “I’m genuinely not sure in terms of what the schedule is. But I’d make a pretty basic point, first of all, diplomacy involves meeting people with whom you disagree, and the British government has very strong views in terms of the present conduct of the government of Israel.\n“It is right that we are engaging with politicians from across the region, because the suffering is incalculable and it needs to stop … In order to get to a path to that two-stage solution, of course you’re going to have to be talking not just to the Palestinians but also to the Israelis,” Alexander said.\nLabour MPs have called on the government to avoid meeting Herzog, saying any talks would send an ambiguous message about the UK’s position on the Gaza war.\nSarah Champion, the Labour MP and chair of the international development committee, posted on X that she hoped it was inaccurate that ministers would meet the Israeli leader: “The UK has recognised the ‘real risk’ of genocide perpetuated by Israel, so unless this meeting is about peace, what message are we sending?”\nJohn McDonnell, the former shadow chancellor, said Herzog should not be permitted entry to the UK. “I am appalled at the decision to allow this representative of a government that is systematically killing Palestinian children on a daily basis to visit our country,” he said.\n“The prime minister is proving to be absolutely tone deaf to the desperate plight of the Palestinian people and the overwhelming feelings of revulsion of the British people at the brutality of the government Herzog represents.”\nThe Labour MP Clive Lewis suggested Starmer should exercise extreme caution. “Dialogue is one thing, but there are times when the act of meeting itself becomes a political statement,” he said.\n“Clearly Herzog is not Netanyahu, their politics on many issues are at variance. But that said, the president’s own words have helped legitimise the collective punishment of Palestinians, language that international jurists have warned could fall foul of the genocide convention.”\nHowever, Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, who has been a strong critic of Israel, said “efforts should be made to engage” with Herzog, who had often been at odds with Israel’s hardline prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over domestic issues.\n“The question must be asked: how do you see Israel in 10 years? What is the future for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza? If you have no reasonable alternative plan, Mr President, then there must be a Palestinian state,” she told the Guardian.\n“But the only solution to this is through politics, through discussion. Herzog is easier to talk to than many in the extreme rightwing government in Israel. But we mustn’t pull our punches.”\nCalum Miller, the Liberal Democrats’ foreign affairs spokesperson, said Starmer should “seize this chance to state unequivocally to President Herzog that there must be an end to the suffering in Gaza through an immediate ceasefire”.\nDowning Street has previously indicated that Netanyahu faces arrest if he travels to the UK after the international criminal court issued an arrest warrant for him over alleged war crimes in Gaza.\nHerzog, who is from a different political party to Netanyahu, has a more ceremonial role. He has previously clashed with Netanyahu over democratic and judicial changes but broadly backed the military campaign in Gaza.\nThe Israeli president has received particular attention for a statement in which he asserted that all Palestinians in Gaza were “unequivocally” responsible for the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023.\n“The entire [Palestinian] nation out there … is responsible. It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved,” said Herzog in October 2023.\nThat statement was given additional weight when it was included in the international court of justice’s order of 26 January 2024, finding the right of Palestinians to be protected from genocide was at “imminent risk”, and saying Israel must ensure “with immediate effect” that its forces not commit any of the acts prohibited by the genocide convention and to protect Gaza’s population from genocide.\nHerzog claimed his statement was misrepresented by the ICJ in selectively quoting him.\nStarmer last met Herzog more than a year ago in Paris, shortly after he was elected as prime minister, where he praised the “historic friendship” between Israel and the UK and reiterated the demand for the return of hostages and “support for Israel’s right to self-defence”.\nBut Starmer and Lammy have since adopted a more critical position on Israel’s actions in Gaza, which have killed more than 65,000 people, according to the territory’s health ministry.\nSanctions have been imposed by the UK government on two hardline Israeli cabinet ministers, and Starmer has announced plans alongside France to recognise the state of Palestine this month. However, there remains considerable anger and concern within Labour and elsewhere that the UK has done too little to halt the suffering of Palestinians.\nLast week the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said he planned to boycott a state dinner to be hosted by King Charles during Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK in a fortnight – in protest at the US’s lack of pressure on Israel to end the war."

    "raw_text": "A few months into Israel’s brutal campaign in Gaza, international court of justice judges sat down to write their reply to South Africa’s complaint that Israel was pursuing genocide.\nPublished on 26 January 2024, the order issued by the court called for provisional measures on Israel and said Palestinians in Gaza had “plausible rights to protection from genocide” – rights the court suggested were at a real risk of irreparable damage.\nSupporting that ruling, the judges listed a series of statements made by senior Israeli officials, underpinning the claim by Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN’s main Palestinian agency, UNRWA, that the crisis in Gaza was being “compounded by dehumanising language”.\nSecond in that list of statements was a comment made by Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, in which he asserted that all Palestinians in Gaza were “unequivocally” responsible for the Hamas attack on southern Israel on 7 October.\n“The entire [Palestinian] nation out there that is responsible,” said Herzog. “It is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved.”\nHerzog – who is due in London next week where it is expected he will hold talks with UK ministers – would push back, claiming that his statement was misrepresented by the ICJ in selectively quoting him. It had ignored remarks, he said, in which he added that Israel was “acting in accordance with international law” – a claim contradicted by credible evidence to the contrary on multiple occasions, including a statement from the International Association of Genocide Scholars this week that Israel was committing genocide.\nAs president, Herzog, a former leader of Israel’s Labour party, has tended to work in lockstep with the policies in Gaza of the far-right coalition of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Earlier this week, in a speech at the Israel Defense Prize ceremony in Jerusalem, he praised a “campaign, [where] courageous and important security decisions were made by the political leadership”.\nDuring a visit to Gaza in July, Herzog repeated the official Israeli line – contradicted by foreign leaders and UN agencies – that Israel was not responsible for starvation in Gaza, instead blaming Hamas for looting aid and preventing its proper distribution.\n“Israel is adamantly committed to the rules of international humanitarian law. Even in the midst of war, we are doing everything possible to help civilians in need – in keeping with international law, and our Israeli and Jewish values.”\nAll of which explains why Herzog – once seen inside Israel as the best chance of rehabilitating the tarnished brand of the country’s failing Labour party – is regarded by many these days, not as a potential voice of reason speaking out against Netanyahu’s far-right coalition, but one of its enablers, not least on the diplomatic front where he has been employed to defend Israel’s actions.\nHerzog’s planned visit to the UK next week, where he is expected to meet with ministers, suggests Israel is keen to present the visit as a diplomatic coup amid preparations for briefings to senior media figures.\nFor Herzog, who became president in 2021, the journey from stalwart of Israel’s centrist Labour party to apologist for a brutal war that has killed over 65,000 Palestinians and brought the coastal strip to widening conditions of starvation, is a striking one.\nWhile a largely symbolic role in political terms, Herzog serves as Israel’s head of state, at a time of growing international outrage and horror at its actions. Lacking the huge international standing of his predecessor Shimon Peres (despite Peres’s own failings) or the charisma of Reuven Rivlin, a political enemy of Netanyahu on the right, Herzog has been shunted into the role representing Israel in countries uncomfortable with Netanyahu and his ministers.\nDescribed at the time of his appointment by the Haaretz columnist Allison Kaplan Sommer as being as close to “royalty” as Israel’s political system could conceive, Herzog is the son of Irish-born Chaim Herzog, who served as president from 1983 to 1993, and the grandson of Rabbi Yitzhak Halevi Herzog, who was the first chief rabbi of Ireland before becoming chief rabbi of Palestine, and then Israel, from 1936 until 1959.\nHerzog’s uncle Abba Eban, perhaps the country’s most famous diplomat, was Israel’s foreign minister and an ambassador to the United Nations and to the US.\nA wealthy lawyer by training, Herzog is seen as the last leader of Israel’s Labour party who had a chance of restoring its past electoral influence amid Israel’s swing rightwards under Netanyahu. Seen as softly spoken, respectful, and even bland, Herzog ran unsuccessfully for prime minister in 2015 in what many judged to be a lacklustre campaign.\nOnce a strong advocate for a two-state solution, Herzog, suggested he had changed his view after the Hamas attacks of 2023. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, he said expecting Israel to withdraw from settlements in the illegally occupied West Bank was “not realistic at all. It doesn’t make sense to Israelis. They need to see something that makes sense in terms of their personal security and safety.”"

    "raw_text": "At least nine people, including five children, have been killed in an Israeli strike while fetching water in al-Mawasi, an area of southern Gaza which Israel has designated as a safe zone, health officials said.\nA doctor from al-Nasser hospital shared a picture of the children’s bodies in the hospital, as well as a picture of water jugs left in a pool of blood at the site of the attack on Tuesday.\nThe attack came shortly after the Israel Defense Forces encouraged people to leave Gaza City for al-Mawasi, before Israel’s looming invasion of Gaza City. The Israeli military has sought to displace people from the city before its offensive and has promised that southern Gaza would be able to accommodate them, despite experts disagreeing with the suggestion.\n“We wish to remind you that in al-Mawasi, enhanced services will be provided with an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food,” the Israeli military’s Arabic-language spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X on Tuesday afternoon.\nIsrael continued to push ahead with its operation and began the mobilisation of tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday.\nAt least 60,000 reservists will be called up, with the service of an additional 20,000 to be extended as the Israeli military slowly ramps up its military activity in Gaza City, which it has described as the last stronghold of Hamas.\nIsrael has said that the operation, known as Gideon’s Chariots II, to take over Gaza City will involve five divisions from the country’s standing army and could extend into next year.\nAlready Israel has pushed into the western parts of Gaza City, levelling the once prosperous neighbourhood of Zeitoun and declaring the entire city a “dangerous combat zone” last week. It has intensified its strikes, claiming to have killed the spokesperson of Hamas’s armed wing, Abu Obeida, in a strike on an apartment building in Gaza City on Saturday.\nThe Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 76 people across the Gaza Strip in the last 24 hours, Gaza health authorities said.\nOn Monday, the world’s leading association of genocide scholars said Israel’s actions in Gaza meet the legal definition of the crime. Aid groups have warned that an invasion of Gaza City and the forced displacement of about 1 million people could have devastating humanitarian consequences. The population of the city has swelled over the course of the last 23 months as it became a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced from the near 80% of Gaza that is under evacuation order.\nThe city is already gripped by famine created by Israeli restrictions on aid entering Gaza, which experts say will worsen even in the absence of a military operation. Thirteen people, including three children, died from malnutrition on Tuesday, bringing the total number of people who have starved to death over the last 23 months to 361 – the majority of whom have died since July.\nIsrael is seeking to forcibly displace Gaza City’s residents before its operation and has tried to entice Palestinians to southern Gaza, which already is packed with other displaced people.\nThe head of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, said on Saturday that there is no safe way to conduct a mass evacuation of Gaza City and that no other part of Gaza had the capacity to absorb such mass displacement. Earlier in August, the UN human rights office spokesperson Thameen al-Kheetan said that Palestinians in al-Mawasi had “little or no access to essential services and supplies, including food, water, electricity and tents”.\nMany residents of Gaza City have refused to leave, suspicious of what awaits them in southern Gaza after Israel has attacked so-called humanitarian zones in the past.\nThe Gaza City operation, pushed forward by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from far-right members of his ruling coalition, faces stiff opposition at home. Tens of thousands of Israelis have marched across the country in protest against the war, which they say is aimless and endangers the lives of the remaining hostages in Gaza.\nIsraeli media has reported internal opposition between the country’s cabinet and the military chief of staff. According to Israeli media’s retelling of a security cabinet meeting on Sunday, the Israeli military chief urged the government to take a ceasefire deal instead of pressing on with the Gaza City operation, which he said could harm the lives of hostages in Gaza.\nHamas had accepted a ceasefire proposal two weeks prior that resembled an earlier US draft which Israel had approved in prior rounds of negotiations. Israel has yet to respond to the proposal, baffling mediators.\nIsrael’s planned military operation in Gaza City as well as its continued systematic starving of the territory’s population has prompted a wave of global condemnation.\nOn Tuesday, Belgium announced it would join a growing list of European countries in recognising Palestine as a state. It also announced it would ban goods from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and designate Hamas leaders, violent Israeli settlers and two far-right Israeli ministers as persona non grata.\n“This is not about sanctioning the Israeli people but about ensuring that their government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground,” the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, said in a post on X. He added that the EU should suspend its trade pact with Israel to further pressure it.\nThe move further increases the growing international isolation of Israel as its war in Gaza and subsequent famine grinds on.\nAt least 63,633 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza over the last 23 months. Israel launched the war in Gaza after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages on 7 October 2023."

    "raw_text": "Police in New Zealand have released images and given details of the campsite where two of fugitive Tom Phillips’ children were found, after their father was shot and killed by police on Monday.\nPhillips had spent nearly four years hiding in the wilderness with his children. He was killed in an exchange of fire with police after reports of a burglary in the remote town of Piopio. A police officer is recovering in hospital after being shot in the head by Phillips with a high-powered rifle in the standoff. About 11 hours after Phillips was killed, two of his children were found safe and well at the campsite in Waitomo. It is understood the third child was with Phillips at the time of the shooting.\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, police commissioner Richard Chambers said authorities found at least one firearm and ammunition at the campsite, which was about 2km from where Phillips had been killed.\nHe said authorities were able to “get the support of one of the children … to locate the remaining children in dense bush”. The image released showed quad bikes, tyres and cans of soft drink in the thick bushland.\nChambers said the campsite was in “deep bush … not an easily found location for anyone”.\nChambers also said they were looking for potential accomplices who may have helped Phillips and an investigation would continue for “months”. It would examine how Phillips was able to access firearms and quad bikes and “who else may be involved”.\n“[There is] a lot of work to determine whether there is anyone else involved.”\nIn Piopio on Tuesday, residents showed a mix of sadness and relief over the dramatic end to the four-year saga.\nMany expressed support for Phillips and his children, echoing a sentiment that has been prevalent online. The overwhelming feeling was relief that the children were safe, along with a sense that violent confrontation should have been avoided.\n“His death was probably inevitable, the cops were just doing their job, but it was sad they did that in front of the child,” local roadworker Patrick said.\nHis niece Matewehe said she was “relieved” for the children, and worried about their health after the death of their father.\nThe children are now in child protective custody. An urgent suppression order was granted in the high court in relation to aspects of the case on Tuesday evening after an application by a lawyer acting on behalf of the Phillips family.\nOn Tuesday, Warwick Morehu from Oranga Tamariki told reporters the children were settled and “doing well under the circumstances”. He described the situation as “unprecedented” and appealed to the public to give the family privacy.\nPhillips took his children Ember, now 9, Maverick, 10, and Jayda, 12, into the Waikato wilderness in December 2021 following a dispute with their mother. Phillips did not have legal custody of his children. He was facing a raft of charges, including aggravated robbery, aggravated wounding and unlawful possession of a firearm. Experts have expressed concern about the children’s reintegration into society.\nIn the press conference, Chambers reiterated that Phillips should not be considered a hero. “No one who does this to children, who unleashes high-powered rifles on my staff, is a hero,” he said.\nThe police minister, Mark Mitchell, said Phillips had continuously put his children in harm’s way.\n“You had a father in Mr Phillips who had no regard for the safety of those children, a suspect who had taken his family into violent and dangerous offending on previous occasions.”\nChambers provided an update on the injured officer, who he met on Tuesday, and said it would be “a long road to recovery”.\n“He was able to speak to us a little bit … His eyes are not open … it’s very confronting,” the commissioner said.\nAs the community grappled with the tragedy, some in Piopio were reluctant to talk. “We’re over it, to be honest,” one local said in response to a question from the Guardian. Staff at the farm goods store had been advised not to talk.\nKerry Voyle, a local council worker on the main street of Piopio, said on Tuesday morning that Phillips’ death was “really traumatic”, and he felt for his friends and family in the tight-knit, rural community.\nThis sentiment was echoed by farm worker Nicos Pizimolas, outside the store broken into by Phillips.\n“At the end of the day the kids did end up losing their father, so it’s sad for them. At least everyone knows they’re safe now.”"

    "raw_text": "A fugitive father who had been hiding in New Zealand’s rugged wilderness with his three children for nearly four years has been shot dead by police investigating an armed burglary, police said on Monday.\nThe whereabouts of Tom Phillips has attracted headlines around the world since just before Christmas 2021, when he fled into the Waikato wilderness with his children Ember, now 9, Maverick, 10, and Jayda, 12, following a custody dispute with their mother.\nPolice, alerted to a burglary early on Monday, pursued two suspects on a quad bike before coming under fire from one of them from a high-powered rifle, authorities said. Police returned fire, killing the shooter, who they believe to be Phillips, pending formal identification.\nHours later, authorities located Phillips’s children, two of whom were believed to be in the wilderness, amid concerns they would be alone in temperatures that were forecast to reach freezing overnight.\nPolice deputy commissioner Jill Rogers said they were found at a local campsite, adding: “I can confirm that the children are well and uninjured, and they will be taken to a location this evening for medical checks.”\nEarlier, Rogers said: “This has been a deeply traumatic incident this morning for those involved. It has been confronting and challenging in a small, rural, isolated location.”\nPrime minister Christopher Luxon said the morning’s events were “sad and absolutely tragic”.\n“This is not what anybody wanted to happen today and I think that is … a consistent feeling from everybody across New Zealand,” he told media on Monday afternoon.\nIn a statement to broadcaster RNZ, the mother of the three children, known as Cat, said she was relieved the ordeal had come to an end but was “saddened by how events had unfolded”.\n“Our hope has always been that the children could be returned in a peaceful and safe way for everyone involved,” she said.\nRogers said police were called to a commercial property at 2.30am after reports of a burglary at a rural farm supply store in Piopio. “Information came to police that described two people on a quad bike, dressed in farm clothing and wearing headlamps,” Rogers said.\nThe quad bike was spotted travelling along a rural road, with items from the store attached. Police officers laid spikes at an intersection, which the quad bike ran over, she said. The quad bike came to a halt, which is when police came under fire, with one officer sustaining critical but survivable injuries.\n“Our officer has been struck in the head … soon after a second patrol unit arrived and engaged the offender,” she said, adding the offender was given immediate first aid but died at the scene. “The formal identification of this male is yet to take place, but we believe him to be Tom Phillips.”\nRogers said one of his children was located at the scene, as well as multiple firearms. “The child located at the scene is being provided wrap around support, and we will not be providing any other comment at this time on their location.”\nSpecialist teams, including about 50 staff and the armed offenders squad, were out in force to locate the other two children, Rogers said on Monday afternoon, noting there were about three hours of daylight left.\n“It will be down to freezing point, I would imagine, this evening,” the acting deputy commissioner said. “Hence we want this incident resolved as soon as possible.”\nThe police constable who suffered critical injuries is undergoing the first of many surgeries at hospital.\nCat expressed her concern for the police officer who was injured in the incident and to the community that had been affected. “Your compassion has sustained us,” she said.\nThe family would be working with government agencies to support the safe return and reconnection of the children, she said. “They have endured a long and difficult journey, and we ask for privacy as we help them adjust and reintegrate into a stable and loving environment.”\nThe mayor of Waitomo, John Robertson, told the Guardian it was the worst possible outcome for the community.\n“I’m shattered, to be honest and there will be many in the community that are devastated that this was the outcome after three and a half, four years,” he said.\nRobertson said the community was deeply concerned for the welfare of the children and he had hoped that the situation would have been resolved through negotiations with Phillips.\nPhillips’ family and the family of the policeman would be deeply affected, he said.\n“It’s just devastating news. Really the worst outcome we could have expected.”\nThe vast Waikato region, where Phillips was presumed hiding, is made up of long sweeping coastline to the west, forested terrain and farmland in the centre, limestone cave networks to the north and a smattering of small rural towns and settlements throughout.\nPhillips came from a farming family in Marokopa – a tiny coastal settlement of less than 100 people that became inextricably linked with Phillips’s story.\nThe remoteness of the landscape frustrated police attempts to locate Phillips.\nThe case has fascinated New Zealanders, who have struggled to understand how, in a country of close-knit communities, Phillips could have evaded detection. While there was no suggestion his family helped Phillips, the question of how he managed to conceal himself and his three children – and survive – in the harsh terrain puzzled the nation, leading to speculation others in the community may have aided him."

    "raw_text": "In a tragic end to a case that has captivated New Zealand for nearly four years, fugitive father Tom Phillips was shot dead by police after a burglary on Monday. Phillips had been on the run with his three children since 2021. One of the children was with Phillips during the exchange of fire near Piopio on Monday, while the two others remained missing for hours after his death.\nThe long-running mystery over Phillips and his children’s whereabouts has prompted multiple searches, offers of rewards, and pleas for information from family members and the police. New Zealand struggled to understand how, in a country of close-knit communities, Phillips could have evaded detection.\nIt began just before Christmas 2021, when Phillips fled into the Waikato wilderness with his children Ember, now 9, Maverick, 10, and Jayda, 12, following a dispute with their mother. Phillips did not have legal custody of his children.\nThe vast Waikato region, where Phillips was presumed to have been hiding, is made up of long sweeping coastline to the west, forested terrain and farmland in the centre, limestone cave networks to the north and a smattering of small rural towns and settlements throughout.\nPhillips came from a farming family in Marokopa – a tiny coastal settlement of fewer than 100 people that became inextricably linked with Phillips’s story.\nBefore he disappeared, many New Zealanders would have struggled to pick it out on a map. It is a quiet, isolated settlement in Waikato, two hours from the nearest city, Hamilton, with one long winding road in and out of the densely forested and hilly landscape.\nThe remoteness of the landscape frustrated police attempts to locate Phillips.\nWhile there was no suggestion his family helped Phillips, the question of how he managed to conceal himself and his three children – and survive – in the harsh terrain puzzled the nation, leading to speculation others in the community may have aided him.\nPhillips’ lengthy disappearance was preempted by an earlier – albeit shorter – stint where he went bush with his children. In September 2021, the four were reported missing and his ute was found abandoned along the Marokopa shoreline, resulting in a major search operation across land and sea.\nNineteen days later, Phillips and the children walked into his parents’ farmhouse just outside Marokopa. Phillips claimed he had taken his children on an extended camping trip in dense bush in an effort to clear his head. He was charged with wasting police time and resources.\nBut fewer than three months later, the four were reported missing again and when Phillips failed to show for a January court appearance, a warrant was issued for his arrest.\nSightings of Phillips and his children over the nearly four years were rare and fleeting. They had little contact with society during this time – though Phillips took at least one child out of the bush in May 2023, when he allegedly committed an armed bank robbery in nearby Te Kūiti, and in November that year when he allegedly attempted to rob a small grocery store. While there were several other sightings in mid-2023 and an $80,000 reward was put up for information in June, the trail went cold.\nPolice described Phillips as someone who “doesn’t live a mainstream lifestyle”, eschewing social media and limiting his use of mainstream banks. Nobody knows for certain how Phillips and his children survived through the years, but the police have asked farmers to check for missing stock. His purchases of camping items and seedlings suggested he was living off the land.\nIn October 2024, footage emerged of an adult and three children walking through Marokopa farmland, after a chance encounter with teenage pig hunters who pulled out their phones and began filming. Police believed it to be Phillips and his three children. A police search of the area the following day failed to find them.\n‘Devastated that this was the outcome’\nAs the months stretched on, little emerged about the missing family. Last month, members of Phillips’ family appealed for him to come home, in some of their first public comments since he vanished years earlier. His sister, Rozzi Phillips, said she hoped that he would see their appeal and “see that he can come home and we are here for him and it might just be OK”.\nA little over a week later, CCTV footage believed to show Phillips and one of his children allegedly breaking into and stealing from a convenience store was released by police.\nOn Monday, the case reached its tragic end after police were called to a commercial property at 2.30am, following reports of a burglary at a rural farm supply store in Piopio. Phillips and one of his children fled the scene on a quad bike, with items from the store attached, said deputy commissioner Jill Rogers.\nPolice officers laid spikes at an intersection, which halted the quad bike. An officer attending the scene was then fired upon and struck in the head. A second patrol unit arrived and shot Phillips.\n“The formal identification of this male is yet to take place, but we believe him to be Tom Phillips,” said Rogers.\nRogers said one of Phillips’ children was located at the scene, as well as multiple firearms. The other two were located uninjured after an hours-long search later in the day.\nThe mayor of Waitomo, John Robertson, told the Guardian it was the worst possible end to the saga.\n“I’m shattered, to be honest, and there will be many in the community that are devastated that this was the outcome after three and a half, four years,” he said.\nRobertson had hoped that the situation could have been resolved through negotiations with Phillips. His family and the family of the policeman would be deeply affected, he said.\nThe children’s mother, Cat, issued a statement on Monday in which she said she was “deeply relieved” that the “ordeal” for her children had ended.\n“They have been dearly missed every day for nearly four years, and we are looking forward to welcoming them home with love and care,” she said."

    "raw_text": "Thailand’s former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve one year in jail, the country’s supreme court has ruled, in a major blow to one of the country’s most prominent and polarising politicians.\nThe court ruled that Thaksin had not properly served an eight-year sentence for corruption and abuse of power, which was handed down when he returned to the country from self-imposed exile in 2023. After arriving back in the country, Thaksin spent less than 24 hours in jail, but was moved to the VIP wing of a hospital on health grounds, where he stayed for six months before he was released on parole.\nIn its judgment, the supreme court found that the arrangement allowing Thaksin to stay at hospital was unlawful. “The defendant knows his sickness was not an urgent matter, and staying in hospital cannot count as a prison term,” said the ruling read out by a judge.\n“The court will issue a jail warrant and an official from Bangkok Remand Prison will take him,” the judge said.\nIn a statement on social media, Thaksin, a towering figure in Thai politics, said he accepted the judgment. “From today on, even though I will lose my freedom, I will still have freedom of thought for the benefit of my country and its people,” he said.\nThe arrangement allowing Thaksin to stay in hospital was highly controversial at the time, with many questioning the seriousness of his health condition.\nHis return to Thailand coincided with his party Pheu Thai taking power, as part of an unlikely coalition with its old enemies in military-linked parties – fuelling speculation that he was receiving special treatment as part of a political deal.\nThaksin’s lawyer had insisted that the former leader was sick during his hospital stay, and that “he has completely served his sentence”.\nThaksin, 76, attended court on Tuesday, wearing a suit and yellow tie, the colour associated with Thailand’s powerful monarchy. He had suddenly left the country days earlier, prompting a frenzy of speculation that he might flee into exile once again. However he said in a statement he had gone abroad for a medical appointment.\nTuesday’s verdict is the last of several recent court cases affecting his embattled family, one of the most prominent dynasties in Thai politics.\nHis daughter Paetongatarn Shinawatra, who was removed from her position as prime minister last month, in another setback for the family, told reporters outside court: “My family and I are worried about him, but we are also proud of him. He did several historical things for the country, including through the policies he passed. Today is another historical moment. He will be the fist prime minister that has been sentenced to jail.”\nLast month the constitutional court ousted Paetongtarn, saying she had violated ethical rules during her handling of a border dispute.\nThe supreme court examined Thaksin’s medical records and summoned 31 witnesses, including doctors who treated him, the former head of the corrections department, and the former commander of Bangkok Remand Prison.\nThaksin first came to power in 2001, and developed a strong support base among voters in the north of Thailand. However he was loathed by conservatives, and has been locked in a power struggle with the military royalist establishment for decades, resulting in military coups and countless court rulings ousting or banning politicians linked with his parties.\nThaksin had retained influence even after years in exile, but his popularity has declined since his return to Thailand. The deal he made with his old military rivals when he returned was seen as a betrayal of his support base, and his political clout has since waned.\nAfter his daughter Paetongtarn’s removal from power, Thailand’s parliament appointed Anutin Charnvirakul, a staunch royalist, as prime minister – a result that has pushed Thaksin’s party Pheu Thai into opposition."

    "raw_text": "Thailand’s populist former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra has arrived in Bangkok after more than 15 years in exile as his party returned to government in a controversial pact with its military rivals that keeps reformists out of power.\nThaksin – a hugely influential but also divisive politician – began an eight-year jail term on his return, though commentators have noted that his arrival in the country coincides with his party’s return to office and a backroom deal could allow him to escape a full sentence.\nHours after his return, Srettha Thavisin from Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party secured enough support to become prime minister in a high-stakes parliamentary vote. He will form a government with pro-monarchy military-backed parties associated with the former generals who led the 2014 coup.\nThe young, reformist Move Forward party promised to remove the military from politics and amend the country’s severe lese majesty law after winning an election in May, but it was blocked from forming a government by military-appointed senators.\nThaksin arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday morning, placing a flower wreath and prostrating before a portrait of Thailand’s king and queen at the gate of the airport terminal. He wore a suit with a yellow lapel pin bearing a royal insignia, and appeared only briefly in front of the media, accompanied by his three children, before being driven to court and prison.\nBehind fencing outside the airport, crowds of mostly older supporters, unable to see Thaksin, cheered and shouted: “We love Thaksin.” One supporter, hearing the news he had arrived, said: “Our dream has come true.” Many had travelled overnight on long journeys, sharing vans with relatives and neighbours, so they could witness his return.\nThe supreme court said Thaksin would serve eight years in prison, though there is widespread speculation he will avoid a full sentence. On Tuesday afternoon, the Department of Corrections said Thaksin had undergone a medical checkup and been found to have heart and lung problems, high blood pressure and spine problems.\nThaksin is eligible to apply for a royal pardon during his first day in jail, in accordance with existing rules for convicts.\nWhen asked if Thaksin’s hair would be cut short, as is standard for prisoners, Ayuth Sintoppant, the director general of the corrections department, said there was no rush, but added: “If it’s long, we have to cut it following the rules. But it won’t be as short as other prisoners, we have to consider this respectfully for the elderly. He’s in a vulnerable group.”\nThaksin was ousted by a military coup in 2006 and has lived in exile to avoid legal charges that he has previously said are politically motivated, including a conviction in absentia for corruption. Thaksin’s youngest daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, posted on Facebook saying he was safe and had “entered the legal process”.\nPheu Thai says its decision to form a coalition with its longstanding enemies, the military-aligned parties, was necessary in order to win enough support for Srettha to become prime minister and tackle important issues relating to livelihoods and the economy.\nThailand has been stuck in deadlock for weeks after the pro-reform Move Forward was blocked from forming a governmentshieldsmonarchy, leaving Pheu Thai to lead a fresh effort.\nSrettha said he was honoured to be selected as prime minister after winning a parliamentary vote. “I will try my best to fulfil my duties … I will lift up the wellbeing of all Thai people,” he said.\nThe deal with the military-backed parties has divided Thaksin’s supporters, angering those who say the party has abandoned its democratic principles while others were overjoyed at Thaksin’s return.\nHis supporters had already begun gathering at the airport from Monday evening, dressed in red and hanging banners that read “Welcome people’s prime minister” and “PM Thaksin, the PM that stays in the people’s hearts for ever”.\nSansuk Termsrisuk, 62, who spoke to the Guardian before her journey from her home in Nakhon Ratchasima, said she would bring chao kuay, a dessert consisting of black grass jelly in syrup, to give to Thaksin as a welcome gift.\n“This is the day I have been waiting for. When I talk about it I feel like I want to cry,” she said, adding that she believed that when Thaksin was in power, the economy was much better and she had everything she needed. By contrast, it was hard for her to make a living as a vendor. “I really want to see him, even if I only see his car that’s going to be enough for me,” she said.\nThaksin first came to power as prime minister in 2001 and went on to build a loyal voter base in rural areas of the north and north-east of the country. Policies such as a universal healthcare scheme and a village fund programme to stimulate economic activity in rural areas made a concrete difference to people’s lives, and for years he was unbeatable at the ballot box.\nYet he was strongly opposed by the military-royalist establishment, which viewed him as corrupt and of seeking to upstage the monarchy.\nThe military seized power in a coup twice, while political parties associated with Thaksin were repeatedly dissolved, and prolonged street protests paralysed Bangkok. A deadly crackdown on Thaksin’s supporters by the army in 2010 left more than 90 people dead.\nFor many of his supporters, it was unthinkable that Pheu Thai could join with military-linked rivals. “What were we fighting for?” said the activist Sombat Boonngam-anong.\nDr Punchada Sirivunnabood, an associate politics professor at Mahidol University, said the political deal was unprecedented given the gulf in ideologies between the two sides and would ruin Pheu Thai in the next elections. Key party figures had promised during the election campaign they would not do a deal with the generals.\nUnder election rules that were rewritten after the 2014 military coup, Srettha needed to secure majority support from both the lower house of 500 elected MPs and the 250 senators – who are unelected and were appointed by the military – to become prime minister.\nThe military-aligned senate previously blocked the reformist Move Forward’s leader Pita Limjaroenrat from becoming prime minister.\nSombat said he believed Thaksin’s return was part of the political deal. He said he sympathised with Thaksin and his desire to return home, but added that “if you consider the damage to the country, [this deal] is not worth it.”."

    "raw_text": "When Thailand’s former leader Thaksin Shinawatra returned from exile in August, he became arguably the most high-profile person held in the country’s notorious prisons. But the billionaire businessman, who was jailed over corruption-related charges, was inside for little more than 12 hours before he was moved to the premium ward of a hospital in Bangkok.\nHis perceived soft handling has prompted claims of special treatment and ignited a series of wider questions about standards within the prison system.\nAccording to reports in Thai media, Thaksin was moved to the wing of a hospital with private rooms fitted with air conditioning and a TV, fridge, sofa and dining table, while under 24-hour care by nurses. The exact contents of his room are unclear.\nOfficials have denied he’s been the recipient of any special treatment, saying the former prime minister needed urgent care as he was experiencing insomnia, chest tightness and high blood pressure and the oxygen levels in his fingertips were low.\nHowever, activists and lawyers have pointed to conditions inside Thailand’s jails, where cells are overcrowded and lacking in hygiene and medical care is limited. They say the same standard of care should be afforded to all prisoners.\nIn a recent article for the Bangkok Post, Andrea Giorgetta of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) writes: “One positive aspect of the Thaksin saga is that it has put a spotlight on the often-overlooked issue of prison conditions in Thailand.”\nThe FIDH’s latest annual report on the state of jails noted that while the prison population was falling, jails remained overstretched and had been repeatedly criticised for falling below international standards.\nAccess to showering facilities is often extremely limited; in one facility, inmates are allowed to stand under a shower only for the time it takes a prison guard to count up to 15. In the centre of a cell there are typically one to three squat toilets, with a tub of water and a bowl used for flushing and cleaning – but often such water has run out, the FIDH report found. Cells can be shared by as many as 50 or 60 people, according to the group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights (TLHR).\nPolitical prisoners represented by TLHR have, like others, reported a lack of nutritious food and clean drinking water. Prison water has a strong smell of chlorine, inmates say, with some reporting seeing mosquito larvae in the water. If prisoners want to buy bottled water or food, they must work in the prison or rely on family to send items.\nActivists and lawyers say that when inmates do become ill, accessing medical care is a drawn-out process.\n“There may be certain facts or circumstances in Mr Thaksin’s case that required such expedited procedure,” Poonsuk Poonsukcharoen, a lawyer at TLHR, says of Thaksin’s overnight transfer. “But from our experiences in working with other prisoners, that’s an unusually quick timeframe.”\nSome have contrasted Thaksin’s swift transfer to hospital with that of the political prisoners charged under the country’s strict lese-majesty laws, who can spend weeks on hunger strike before they are taken to hospital.\nOne woman, known as Warunee and represented by TLHR, was moved to a university hospital this week, but only after spending 14 days on hunger strike. Her body weight had already dropped 10%, from 37kg to 33kg.\nPoonsuk says she was particularly concerned about Warunee’s wellbeing. She has bipolar disorder, and it is feared that sleep deprivation due to her hunger strike and conditions inside may exacerbate her condition. Medication is also limited in the prison, Warunee has told her lawyers.\nOther young protesters imprisoned for lese-majesty have waited longer to be hospitalised. Parit Chiwarak, a prominent protest leader also known as Penguin, was transferred to hospital only on the 47th day of his hunger strike.\nAfter Thaksin’s move to hospital, the hashtag VVIP begun trending and footage of him in exile – including a 2021 clip of him energetically boxing – was shared on social media, as people raised questions about the seriousness of his condition. His daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra has said she is worried about his heart, and that he had lung problems after contracting Covid.\nStill, some have now speculated that he could spend the remainder of his sentence – which has been reduced by a royal pardon from eight years to one year – in hospital.\nPoonsuk says it is possible Thaksin has been treated differently from her clients because of his advanced age. If he is ill, TLHR has no complaints about his treatment, she says, but adds: “We would hope that other prisoners would be afforded the same standard as well.”"

    "raw_text": "Thailand’s influential former prime miniser Thaksin Shinawatra flew out of the country on Thursday, police said, a day before a parliamentary vote for the next prime minister and ahead of a court ruling that could see him jailed.\nMany in Thailand spent Thursday evening glued to flight tracking websites, avidly following the path of Thaksin’s private jet.\nNews that he was at Bangkok’s Don Mueang Airport broke early on Thursday evening, with local media reporting he had been stopped by immigration. He planned to visit Singapore for two days for a medical appointment, Thai outlets reported.\nHis plane took off after authorities confirmed that he did not have any court order prohibiting him from leaving the country, police said in a statement.\nAs he left Thailand, social media was flooded with speculation. Many wondered if Thaksin might instead head to Dubai, where he previously lived in self-imposed exile to avoid legal charges for abuse of power and conflicts of interest.\nHis trip abroad comes just days before a court is due to rule in a legal case that could result in him being sent to jail – and the night before parliament was set to decide who should replace his ousted daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra as prime minister.\nTens of thousands tracked his plane online, as it flew from Bangkok down through the Gulf of Thailand, then crossing through Malaysia. But rather than stopping in Singapore, the plane suddenly turned west, and looped in two circles.\nThai media interviewed aviation experts on air, analysing the flight path, the amount of fuel carried and its possible destination, as the story led the news bulletins.\n“Dear Passenger, your captain is flying in circles to entertain Flightradar viewers, please wave your hands,” joked one social media user. Then the plane began to fly in the direction of India.\nThaksin previously spent more than 15 years in exile to avoid legal charges, and returned to Thailand only in 2023, after striking an uneasy deal with his old enemies in the military royalist establishment. The deal was mutually beneficial, with the two sides forming a government to keep a popular, youthful pro-reform party out of power.\nThaksin was sentenced to eight years in prison upon his return to Thailand, which was commuted to one year by the king. He spent less than 24 hours in prison after citing health problems, instead staying six months in a VIP hospital wing, before being released on parole.\nThat arrangement is now the subject of a court case, due to be decided next week. It’s possible he could be returned to prison, if judges deem that he has not yet adequately served out his sentence.\nEarly on Friday morning, Thaksin wrote on social media that he would return to Thailand no later than Monday, and that he would attend court in person on Tuesday to hear the judgment handed down.\nThaksin responded to online speculation by saying he had intended to travel to Singapore for a medical checkup with a doctor he had seen previously while living abroad. “Thai immigration delayed me for nearly two hours,” he said, adding this happened despite him having the right to travel.\nThe delay prevented him from landing at Singapore’s Seletar Airport, which is used for private jets, as the airport only operates until 10pm, he said.\n“Since I couldn’t land in Singapore, I decided to have the pilot change my plans to Dubai. I have long-time orthopedic and pulmonary doctors in Dubai, and I also had the opportunity to visit friends in Dubai whom I hadn’t seen in over two years,” Thaksin wrote, saying his pilot had circled in the sky while waiting for permission from the airport in Dubai.\nOn social media, speculation about his family’s broader prospects continued. On Friday, Thailand’s parliament is due to vote in a new prime minister, with the royalist conservative politician Anutin Charnvirakul expected to win in a race again Chaikasem Nitisiri, a candidate from Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party."

    "raw_text": "Thailand’s constitutional court has dismissed Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her position as prime minister, ruling that as the country’s leader she violated ethical rules during a phone call with Cambodia’s senate president, Hun Sen.\nThe ruling, which threatens to usher in a fresh period of instability in the country, means she immediately loses her job, which she had held for about a year. The 39-year-old had already been suspended from her duties on 1 July after a recording was leaked of the phone conversation, in which they discussed a simmering border dispute between the neighbouring countries.\nCritics accused her of failing to protect Thailand’s interests during the call, in which she addressed Hun Sen as “uncle”, and told him that if there were anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made critical remarks about a senior Thai military commander.\nThe court said Paetongtarn had put her private interests before those of the nation and damaged the reputation of the country. “Due to a personal relationship that appeared aligned with Cambodia, the respondent was consistently willing to comply with or act in accordance with the wishes of the Cambodian side,” the court said in a statement.\nPaetongtarn, the daughter of the billionaire former Thai leader Thaksin Shinawatra, had apologised for her comments, describing them as a negotiating tactic.\nSpeaking to media after the verdict, Paetongtarn said she accepted the judgment, but added: “I never asked for anything for my own benefit … the most important thing I have always upheld is the lives of our people, whether military or civilian. I am truly determined to protect their lives.\n“As a Thai, I love my nation, religion, and monarchy with all my heart, as much as any Thai can.”\nWeeks after the recording was leaked, the border dispute erupted into a five-day conflict in which dozens of people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced.\nAnger over the phone call, and Paetongtarn’s handling of the border crisis, has been exacerbated by a perception that her family’s personal relationship with Hun Sen – an old friend turned foe – was undermining Thailand’s response to the border crisis.\nA full version of the recording was published by Hun Sen, who later threatened to release further compromising information about Paetongtarn’s father, Thaksin. Hun Sen is known to have been an old friend of Thaskin’s, though, for unknown reasons, a bitter feud erupted between the two men earlier this year.\nAfter the phone call was released, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Bangkok, demanding Paetongtarn’s resignation and calling her a traitor.\nFriday’s verdict is a major blow for the Shinawatra family, which has dominated Thai politics for decades.\nPaetongtarn is the fourth member of her family to have their term cut short either by a military coup or court ruling. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006, while in 2008 Thaksin’s brother-in-law Somchai Wongsawat, who was prime minister briefly, was also forced from power by a court ruling. In 2014, Thaksin’s sister Yingluck was ousted by a court decision followed by a military coup.\nPaetongtarn took office last year after her predecessor, Srettha Thavisin, also from Thaksin’s party, Pheu Thai, was removed from office over a separate ethics case.\nReferencing Thailand’s courts’ frequent interventions in politics, Paetongtarn said: “Today’s judgment is once again changing politics abruptly. We must all work together, whether in government or opposition, we must unite to restore our political stability … to prevent such sudden changes from happening again.”\nThe Shinawatra family has been locked in a power struggle with the military royalist establishment for decades, but Thaksin has remained influential even after years in exile. However, many analysts believe his family’s power is now significantly dented, with public support diminished and no clear successor.\nIt is unclear who might take over as prime minister. Under the Thai constitution, only individuals who were nominated by their parties as prime ministerial candidates at the last general election are eligible for the office.\nTwo of Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party’s prime minsiterial nominees – Srettha and Paetongtarn – have now been ousted, and the party will face an uphill battle trying to gather enough support for their third nominee, Chaikasem Nitisiri, 77, and hold together its fragile coalition. Deputy prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai will oversee the government in a caretaker capacity until the office is filled.\nDr Punchada Sirivunnabood, professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, Mahidol University, said an election could be held as early as April next year.\nThaksin would probably try to launch a comeback, Sirivunnabood said, but added it was unlikely to be successful. A deal after the last election with its longstanding enemies from military-linked parties had helped Pheu Thai take power, but at the expense of a popular and youthful pro-reform party. Pheu Thai had also failed to deliver on its election pledges, especially in relation to the economy, said Sirivunnabood. “People who supported him have switched to other political parties,” she added."

    "raw_text": "The dispute over Thailand and Cambodia’s contested border, which dates back more than a century to disagreements over colonial-era maps, has broken into conflict before. But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs.\nHun Sen, 72, and Thaksin Shinawatra, 76, former leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, were once such close friends they reportedly called one another brothers. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin’s family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand’s military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen’s home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after he returned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile.\nBut relations have broken down spectacularly over recent months. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries’ border.\nHun Sen and Thaksin are no longer in office in their respective countries, but both remain powerful. Hun Sen ruled for almost 40 years until 2023, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister after running virtually uncontested in a sham election. Thaksin’s daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister last year.\nThe extent of their falling out became clear last month, when Hun Sen leaked a recording of a phone conversation between himself and Paetongtarn.\nIn the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander.\nThe leaked recording caused uproar in Thailand. Critics accused her of kowtowing to Cambodia, putting her family connections before the country’s national interests. She was suspended from office by the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations.\nIt’s not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over.\nSome analysts say Hun Sen may be trying to whip up nationalism domestically to increase support for his son, Hun Manet.\nOthers suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand’s efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. This form of lucrative criminal activity has proliferated in the region over recent years, especially in Cambodia.\n“The popular narrative in Thailand is that the two men may have had some kind of personal dealings behind the scenes that did not go according to plan and the fallout has spilled over into the realm of national interest,” said Tita Sanglee, associate fellow with ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\nWhatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin’s position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand.\nHun Sen, meanwhile, “holds near absolute control in Cambodia”, adds Tita. He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.”\nOn Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.”\nGiven Thaksin’s weakened position, he may not have a choice but to let the military take the lead.\nLast week Thailand downgraded it diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador, and saying it would expel the country’s envoy in Bangkok.\nThaksin has denied the families’ feud was the cause of the clashes. However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue.\nAs he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You’re Hun Sen’s friend, aren’t you? Is he your friend? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?”\nSolving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries’ dispute even more unpredictable."

    "raw_text": "Anutin Charnvirakul, a staunch royalist, has been appointed by lawmakers as Thailand’s next prime minister after days of heated negotiations and political drama.\nThe 58-year-old tycoon turned politician is considered a conservative, though he made a name for himself for leading a campaign to decriminalise cannabis. He was voted in after a chaotic scramble by parties to gain enough support to replace the ousted PM, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who was removed from office by a court ruling.\nFriday’s vote is a major setback for Paetongtarn’s family, one of the country’s most influential and polarising political dynasties. Thaksin Shinawatra, Paetongtarn’s billionaire father and a former leader himself, suddenly left the country by private jet the night before the vote, prompting a frenzy of speculation. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday, when judges will rule on whether he has adequately served his sentence for previous convictions.\nThaksin said he had travelled to see a doctor in Dubai, where he spent much of his time in exile, and that he would return in time to attend court.\nThailand’s constitutional court removed Paetongtarn from office a week ago, saying she had violated ethical rules during her handling of a border dispute with Cambodia. That made her the fourth member of her family to be ousted before reaching the end of her term. The ruling prompted a race between Pheu Thai and Anutin’s Bhumjaithai party to fill the position, with days of horse trading between rival parties.\nAnutin, an experienced politician, comes from a family that owns one of Thailand’s biggest construction companies, which built Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport, as well as parliament itself.\nHe has served as deputy prime minister, interior minister and health minister, during which time he campaigned for cannabis legalisation. The legal changes were criticised for being rushed through without adequate safeguards, leading to an explosion of dispensaries and recreational use across Thailand, though Anutin says the policy was always focused on medical use.\nAnutin told reporters as he exited parliament to visit his father in a hospital that he would work hard to solve the country’s problems. “I intend to work with my full capability,” he said. “I must work every day and make the most out of it, with no day off.”\nHe secured enough votes after promising the pro-reform People’s party that, were it to lend its support, he would hold an election in four months, and commit to changing Thailand’s constitution, possibly through holding a referendum.\nThe People’s party, formerly the Move Forward party, has little in common with Bhumjaithai, a conservative royalist party, but has said it believes this arrangement is the quickest way to bring about an election and reform Thailand’s system to make it more democratic. It will not join Anutin’s government.\nSome of the supporters of the People’s party have questioned whether Anutin can be trusted to stick to his promises, however.\nThe deal allowed him to achieve a thumping victory over Chaikasem Nitisiri, 77, a veteran lawyer and the candidate put forward by Thaksin’s Pheu Thai.\nAnutin won 311 votes, more than double Chaikasem’s 152.\nThe result adds to the problems facing Thaksin, whose popularity and political clout have faded since his return from 15 years in self-imposed exile in 2023.\nHe returned after striking a controversial deal with his old enemies in the conservative establishment. The arrangement, seen by many as a betrayal of his supporters, has crumbled, while his popularity has dwindled and his legal troubles mounted.\nIn a post on X, Thaksin said he was in Dubai for a medical checkup and to see old friends. “I will be back in Thailand by September 8 to personally attend court on the 9th,” he said."

    "raw_text": "The succession battle at Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has ended.\nThe family announced on Monday that Lachlan Murdoch, Murdoch’s eldest son, will secure control of the Murdochs’ sprawling media empire that includes Fox News, The Wall Street Journal and The Times in the UK, with his three oldest siblings receiving an estimated $1.1bn each for their shares in the business.\nThe deal ends a sometimes bitter legal battle between Murdoch’s oldest children for control of their 94-year-old father’s business that has been reminiscent of the HBO show Succession, which was purportedly inspired by the Murdoch family. It also conserves the media company’s conservative bent; Lachlan Murdoch is regarded as the most conservative of Murdoch’s oldest children.\nLachlan is the current chair of News Corp, the parent company of over two dozen publications including the Journal, The Times and the New York Post, after he succeeded his father in 2023.\nRupert Murdoch’s children with his third wife Wendy Deng, Chloe and Grace, will join Lachlan in a new family trust that will hold controlling stakes in Fox Corporation and News Corp, the Murdochs’ media groups. Under the agreement, Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch and James Murdoch will be the beneficiaries of a trust that will house the proceeds of the sale.\nThe three children took their father to court in Reno, Nevada, after he tried to wrest away their voting power and leave Lachlan with sole control of the companies in a project Murdoch reportedly named “Project Family Harmony”.\nAccording to court records, Murdoch told others in private that while he wanted harmony in the family, he believed Lachlan was the best to lead his media empire into the future.\n“Would love nothing more than peace all around,” he wrote to his ex-wife Anna, the mother of Elisabeth, Lachlan and James. “But the fact remains Lachlan is the best to run the business — greatly respected inside and outside!”\nDuring the legal dispute, Murdoch told his eldest children, according to the New York Times: “These companies are my legacy. I have put everything into them over my life.” He described his media assets as a “protector of the conservative voice in the English-speaking world” and argued only Lachlan’s leadership could protect them in that role.\nFamily and political differences appear to have driven a wedge between Lachlan and his siblings. James Murdoch has been a vocal critic of the political slant of the family business, particularly on climate change and its support of Donald Trump, who is currently suing Murdoch’s the Wall Street Journal.\nIn a rare interview earlier published this year, James Murdoch told the Atlantic magazine that he regarded his father as a “misogynist” and described Fox News as a “menace” to US democracy. According to the article, James and Rupert had barely spoken in years.\nThe family finally agreed on a buyout after the case, which happened out of public eye for months, went into appeals, according to the New York Times.\nLast December, Nevada commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had acted in “bad faith” in their attempts to change the terms of an irrevocable trust that divided control of the company between Murdoch’s four oldest children.\nGorman’s scathing 96-page opinion accused Murdoch and his eldest son of a “carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles”.\nLachlan Murdoch is now the de facto heir to one of the world’s most powerful media businesses. As well as Fox News and Fox Sports and the multinational newspaper business, the Murdochs control publisher Harper Collins and the fast-growing Tubi, a free streaming service.\n“News Corp’s board of directors welcomes these developments and believes that the leadership, vision and management by the Company’s Chair, Lachlan Murdoch, will continue to be important to guiding the Company’s strategy and success,” News Corp said in a statement."

    "raw_text": "An elderly billionaire goes to war with his adult children over the future of his media empire. His only ally is his eldest son, crowned leader of his father’s enterprise after years of jostling with his siblings.\nIn choosing a successor, the patriarch spurns three of his other children, who remain threats: when he dies, they will each have just as much power as the eldest son to shape his companies, potentially against the rightwing ideologies that have guided them for decades.\nAway from the public eye, he makes a dramatic move. To deliver control to his eldest son, the mogul quietly launches an extraordinary bid to alter the trust set to hand the other three influence upon his death. But they stand ready to fight.\nThis may sound akin to HBO’s Succession, but it’s life imitating art – which was, in turn, imitating life.\nRupert Murdoch, 93, the billionaire owner of News Corp and Fox Corporation who helped inspire the show, is trying to give his eldest son, Lachlan, full control of his media outlets upon his death. While his other adult children – James, Elisabeth and Prudence – will still receive equal shares of company profits, this would leave them with no say over the companies upon his death.\nThis battle is in fact bigger than anything featured on Succession, according to Robert Thompson, a media scholar based at Syracuse University. “This is arguably the single most influential media outlet in all of the English-speaking world,” he said of News Corp and Fox. “How this turns out has a real, significant impact on real people living on planet Earth.”\nNews Corp owns more than a hundred major and local newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post in the US, as well as the Times and the Sun in the UK. Meanwhile, Fox is the parent of Fox News, the leading conservative cable network in the US, with millions of viewers.\nThe Murdochs’ legal fight played out in secret for months – until Wednesday, when it burst into the open. The New York Times reported on a decision from a Nevada probate commissioner, which is under seal, that Murdoch can rewrite his family’s irrevocable trust if he can prove the change is being made in good faith and benefits his heirs.\nThe ruling sets the stage for a high-profile trial over the future of his vast array of media interests, with Murdoch and his three children slated to duke it out in court in September.\nBoth sides, according to the Times, have bulked up on high-profile lawyers. William Barr, the former US attorney general, is helping Murdoch rewrite the trust, and he has also hired Adam Streisand, a trial lawyer who previously worked on estate cases involving Michael Jackson and Britney Spears.\nThe feuding appears to have taken its toll on the family. When Rupert married his fifth wife in California last month, Lachlan was said to have been the only one of his four eldest children in attendance. The other two also reportedly steered clear.\nWith Lachlan as his father’s successor, Fox News and News Corp will continue to be a conservative force. But under the trust’s current structure, the three other siblings, who are deemed more politically moderate, can push back.\nMurdoch is seemingly keen to avoid this prospect. Conservatism has been the backbone of his empire since its inception. It has proved to be remarkably profitable.\nThough Murdoch had successfully formed relationships with powerful conservative figures in Australia and the UK, it was not until Donald Trump’s ascendancy that he had close ties to the White House. Though Fox was initially dismissive of Trump, the network soon turned into his most powerful megaphone. In turn, Murdoch had direct access to a commander-in-chief.\nNot all of Murdoch’s children were happy about this. During Trump’s presidency, Elisabeth, Prudence and James started to drift away from their father’s politics.\nWhen Roger Ailes, the longtime Fox CEO, left the company in 2016 off the back of multiple sexual harassment allegations, James reportedly believed he could push the network in a new direction, bringing in an experienced executive who was less of an ideologue. Instead, the elder Murdoch took over as chair himself.\nIn the summer of 2020, James – once a senior executive at News Corp – announced he was resigning from the board over “disagreements over certain editorial content”. He and his wife, Kathryn, were particularly vocal about the climate crisis and seemed to resent Fox News and News Corp’s climate denialism.\n“We’ve been arguing about politics since I was a teenager,” James told the Times in 2020, about his father. In 2020, James and his wife donated more than $600,000 to Biden’s campaign.\nMurdoch eventually crowned Lachlan as his successor. While Lachlan does not speak publicly about his personal political views, reports have said they usually lean more conservative than his father’s. And while Lachlan appears less interested than his father in political influence, he cares about profit. And Trump has been profitable.\nAfter Trump lost in 2020, his relationship with the network soured. Fox News was reporting that Joe Biden had won the election, despite Trump’s rampant claims of interference. “Very sad to watch this happen,” Trump tweeted at the time. “But they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose.”\nWhat’s good for the ratings is good for Fox’s business, and what’s good for the business is what’s good for Murdoch’s heirs – what the judge is looking for when granting Murdoch the ability to change the irrevocable trust.\n“It really is, can you prove what’s in the best interest of the business? Can you prove that something else is in the best interest of the business?” said Zachary Kramer, dean of Elon University School of Law, and an expert in trust and estate law. “What Rupert Murdoch’s position is going to be is: ‘We want to make decisions that are going to be in the best interest of the business, because if the business succeeds, the beneficiaries do better.’”\nJames, Elisabeth and Prudence can argue that supporting Trump hasn’t been all that good for the network. In 2021, Dominion sued the network for $1.6bn in a defamation suit after Trump allies at the network said the voting-equipment company had been involved in a plot to steal the 2020 election.\nFox News ended up settling with Dominion for $787.5m, although it was pocket change compared to the $14.9bn in revenue the wider company made during its 2023 fiscal year.\nOver the last year, relations between Trump and Fox seem to have thawed. Trump calls into shows more frequently, and the channel hosted a town hall with him earlier in the year.\nThe Murdoch family’s influence has shifted in recent years. There are new media players like Newsmax, and other influential billionaires are courting Trump, like Elon Musk, owner of X, who is pumping millions into Trump’s campaign.\nMurdoch himself was seen largely on the sidelines at this month’s Republican national convention in Milwaukee. “There was a time where if you wanted to survive in the Republican party, you had to bend the knee to him or to others,” Donald Trump Jr said at one event at the convention. “I don’t think that’s the case anymore.”"

    "raw_text": "James Murdoch claims he has never watched Succession, the drama series that documents the professional and personal rebellions of a billionaire media family suspiciously similar to his own. But his comments attacking the family business’s record on climate crisis coverage – which blindsided other parts of the family – suggest he may have picked up a few pointers from the HBO show.\nThe declaration that he and his wife, Kathryn, felt “frustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage” of the climate crisis, particularly the “ongoing denial among the news outlets in Australia, given obvious evidence to the contrary”, focused an awkward light on the family’s businesses – but could help James differentiate himself from his father, Rupert, and brother, Lachlan.\nHis statement raised eyebrows, not least because until 18 months ago James was at least nominally responsible for Fox News output as boss of its parent company. He is also still a director of News Corp, which owns the family’s newspaper interests. Peter Barnes, a board member, said the board had yet to discuss the comments.\nBut making a public stand on the issue has also helped the 47-year-old make clear to the wider world that he is heading in a different direction from the family business, as he looks to make investments in media companies with a more liberal standpoint. He has already donated to the US presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, joined the board of Elon Musk’s Tesla, and made clear he wants to distance himself from the conservative outlets associated with his surname.\nAlice Enders, of media analysts Enders, suggested Murdoch had always had a genuine and sincere concern about environmental issues throughout his career: “He and his wife believe in this so fundamentally and so strongly. They obviously believe that the media has a very important role in this.”\nShe added: “It’s very unusual to decide that the public domain is the best place to air a difference of views.”\nThe move caps a long journey for an individual who has often seemed uneasy with his enormous privilege, without ever rejecting it. After dropping out of Harvard in the mid-90s and working as a cartoonist, he helped to run the pioneering New York hip-hop record label Rawkus Records, providing funding for the operation. According to one person who visited the offices in this period, the twentysomething had “pierced ears and eyebrow, dyed hair, a goatee, and a poster of Chairman Mao on his wall in New York”, apparently rebelling against his family while also using its funds to subsidise his interests.\nAfter exiting the music industry – having sold a majority stake in Rawkus to his father – he was brought into the family business, having a brief stint advising on internet investments during the dotcom boom, followed by a spell running Asian pay-TV operator Star. But he shocked the British media scene when he was appointed as chief executive of BSkyB, a listed FTSE 100 company, at the age of 30.\nIt was during this time that he became increasingly concerned about climate change, inviting former US vice-president Al Gore to give a talk on the topic, and was an early convert to making businesses carbon neutral. Following a stint at the European arm of News Corp – where he was in charge as the phone-hacking scandal ravaged its newspapers and forced the closure of the News of the World – he became chief executive of 21st Century Fox until it was sold to Disney at the end of 2018.\nWhile there had been suggestions that James – until recently seen as the heir apparent – would join the combined behemoth, he instead walked away with billions of dollars. In the process, he left his brother in charge of a new, much smaller, Fox Corporation, which controls a group of television channels including Donald Trump’s favourite outlet, Fox News.\nEnders said that Murdoch’s approach to the environment contrasted with his father’s focus on profits at all costs. While it would be hard for the likes of Fox News to U-turn on the issue of the climate crisis, she suggested it could encourage journalists within the organisation to voice their concerns about coverage: “There’s a lot of people who are going to be standing up at News Corp meetings making these points.”\nIndividuals who have worked with Murdoch at BSkyB insist that his commitment to environmental issues is sincere, while also pointing to the influence of his wife, Kathryn, who put her name to the joint statement. In recent days she has used Twitter to share links to stories about investment company BlackRock putting climate change at the centre of its investment strategy and a story in the Murdoch-owned New York Post suggesting conservatives have answers to climate change.\nShe also linked to an article in Vice – an outlet in which James’s company recently bought a minority stake – blaming the bosses of large fossil fuel producers for the bushfires in Australia.\nThe piece is withering about claims that arsonists are responsible for the natural disaster unfolding in Australia, mocking “Rupert Murdoch’s rightwing media outlets” for spreading such claims, which have “been given a huge platform in the US by Donald Trump Jr and Sean Hannity” – critiquing both the president’s son and one of Fox News’s most prominent hosts.\nOn Wednesday it appeared that at least one part of Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper empire was listening. The Northern Territory News – one of the company’s most rambunctious tabloids – ran a front-page editorial breaking with the party line of many other Murdoch outlets: “Now is not the time to play the blame game,” its front page declared. “Now is the time to discuss climate change.”"

    "raw_text": "A lawsuit. Angry calls to editors. Public denunciations. In the wake of the Wall Street Journal’s story claiming Donald Trump contributed to a “bawdy” letter to the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein – featuring a drawing of a naked woman’s silhouette around a typewritten personal message – the president’s relationship with the outlet’s proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, appears on the surface to have deteriorated from temperamental to terminal.\nJust a few days ago, the 94-year-old mogul was spotted among the president’s high-profile guests at the Fifa Club World Cup final. Following the publication of the article, however, Murdoch now finds himself on the president’s lengthy list of media opponents threatened with court action.\nIn an unprecedented environment in which a sitting president regularly takes direct aim at the media, there have been numerous claims of big outlets making decisions that make life easier for their billionaire owners. Yet the Journal published the Epstein allegations even after Trump picked up the phone to its British editor, Emma Tucker, to demand that she ditch the story. Trump also claims Murdoch himself was approached to stop the article, to no avail.\nAccording to some media watchers, it is the latest sign that Murdoch is taking a different approach to Trump’s return than some of his fellow billionaire moguls. Even before the Epstein story dropped on Thursday, Murdoch’s Journal continued to criticise Trump from the right over some of his early decisions.\nIn January, its editorial page took aim at his unconditional pardon for many of those who stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. It also accused Trump of “pleasing China’s Xi Jinping above a law passed by Congress” with what it described as the “illegal” suspension of a law forcing TikTok to break from ByteDance, its Chinese owner. It has also criticised Trump for launching new family crypto tokens.\nIt wasn’t that long ago, either, that Murdoch was Trump’s guest in the Oval office. Even then, however, tensions were on display. Trump brought up his disagreements with the Journal, which had recently dubbed his tariff battle with Canada and Mexico as “the dumbest trade war in history”.\nIt has led some to regard Murdoch’s Journal as representing a political band on the right aware of Trump’s political draw, but sceptical about his economic effects – particularly around the use of tariffs as a constant weapon in his international dealings.\nYet the Journal’s critical stance on aspects of Trump’s presidency is far from proof of a decisive break between Murdoch and the president. Murdoch’s Fox News – the cash cow of his media businesses and a powerhouse in the Maga world – continues to provide supportive content. The Epstein letter story was relegated to an opinion piece low down on the network’s online homepage on Friday morning.\nAnd those who have watched Murdoch’s career closely over the decades tend to conclude that, ultimately, his decisions are driven by business. With the Journal appealing to economically hawkish Trump sceptics on the right and Fox News continuing to serve up content for Trump supporters, Murdoch finds himself at the helm of a media empire on the right with all bases covered.\nThe episode also highlights that, just a few months into Trump’s second coming, internal pressures are pulling at the threads of big players in the Maga media. Already, influential pro-Trump personalities – most notably Tucker Carlson and Laura Loomer – have protested at the lack of action around releasing all documentation relating to Epstein. Others stick to Trump’s line that the existence of extensive files related to the disgraced financier is a “hoax”.\nThe saga appears to confirm Murdoch’s status as a different beast from some of the more recent arrivals to media ownership, developing a skin as thick as rhinoceros hide in his decades making and breaking political careers. As the veteran media writer Ben Smith has put it: “If you want to be a mogul, as the Murdochs have learned over the decades, you can’t make yourself quite that easy to bully.”"

    "raw_text": "The battle between Rupert Murdoch and his children over the future of his media empire begins this week as observers attempt to force the court to make the secretive dispute public.\nMurdoch wants to change the structure of his family trust to give all voting power to his oldest son, Lachlan. If successful, Murdoch’s other adult children, Prudence, James and Elisabeth, will lose their voting power.\nOf the children, Lachlan is the most politically aligned with his father while his younger siblings have expressed reservations about the direction of the companies, particularly during Donald Trump’s presidency.\nBoth sides have hired high-profile lawyers to oversee the case. Murdoch is working with the former US attorney general William Barr, who is helping him rewrite the trust, and Adam Streisand, a trial lawyer who has worked on the estate cases of Michael Jackson and Britney Spears.\nThough the trial will have enormous consequences for Murdoch’s holdings, including Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, Murdoch is fighting to ensure it will largely take place away from the public eye.\nThe only information available to the public are the key dates of the trial, which is being held in Reno, Nevada, listed on the court’s website. The trial is slated to have a status conference on 9 September followed by a series of evidentiary hearings starting 16 September.\nA coalition of six national news outlets – the Associated Press, CNN, NPR, the New York, Reuters and the Washington Post – have filed requests to access proceedings and unseal court records.\n“The fate of the Murdoch Family’s enormous fortune and vast media empire is a matter of immense public interest, and the public also has an interest in ensuring that the public courts administer justice in a proper, impartial manner,” the requests said, according to NBC News.\nOn its website, the court said that while it “has received numerous media inquiries” related to the trial, “the court file on this matter is confidential and sealed as to all matters”.\n“In addition, all court hearings on this matter are closed to the public,” the website said. “No other public information related to this matter is available through the court.”\nAs the trial is set to start, a prominent News Corp investor, the hedge fund Starboard Value, is trying to send a message to Murdoch that his family has too much power over the company. News Corp is the parent company of dozens of media companies including the Wall Street Journal, the Times of London and the book publisher HarperCollins.\nJeffrey Smith, an activist shareholder and founder of Starboard Value, is spearheading efforts to decrease Murdoch’s voting power over the company. Murdoch currently has a 14% stake in News Corp but has 41% of votes over the company through dual-class shares.\nA shareholder proposal from Starboard Value argues that Murdoch should get rid of his dual-class shares, which would eventually be passed down to his children, as the political disagreement in the family “could be paralyzing to the strategic direction” of New Corp.\n“We are not sure why their perspectives should carry greater weight than the views of other shareholders,” Smith wrote in the proposal, according to the New York Times.\nEven if approved, the company’s board can decide not to agree to the proposal. But Smith said that it would “send a clear and direct message” to the board over concerns of the Murdoch family’s power over the company."

    "raw_text": "Rupert Murdoch’s three adult children will retain control over their father’s media empire upon his death, a Nevada court has ruled after Murdoch launched a campaign to wrest away their power and give it all to his oldest son.\nThe New York Times reported on Murdoch’s loss, citing a sealed court decision that was filed on Saturday. The family battle took place outside of the public’s eye, despite attempts from the media to gain access to the trial.\nMurdoch took three of his adult children, James, Elisabeth and Prudence, to court as he tried to completely remove their voting power over the trust Murdoch set up. The current trust structure gives all four adult children equal voting power over Murdoch’s empire, which includes Fox News and News Corp, but Murdoch wanted to give Lachlan, his oldest son and most likeminded child, complete control over the media companies. The change would have affected only the voting power of the siblings, not their financial inheritance.\nAfter reviewing the case, the Nevada commissioner Edmund Gorman concluded that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch had acted in “bad faith” in their attempts to change the terms of an irrevocable trust that divides control of the company between Murdoch’s four oldest children.\nIn a statement, James, Elisabeth and Prudence told the Times: “We welcome Commissioner Gorman’s decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.”\nThe 96-page opinion lambasts the media mogul, according to the Times, accusing him of organizing a “carefully crafted charade” to “permanently cement Lachlan Murdoch’s executive roles” inside the empire “regardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries” of the family trust.\nRepresentatives for Murdoch did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adam Streisand, one of Murdoch’s lawyers, told the Times that Murdoch planned to appeal the decision. Lawyers for James, Elisabeth and Prudence have not spoken publicly about the decision.\nNow that the commissioner has issued his decision for the case, it will be up to a district judge in a probate court to ultimately accept the decision.\nThe ruling revealed Lachlan first pushed the case forward. Murdoch and his eldest son are said to have dubbed the attempt to change the trust “Project Harmony”, with the former believing it would see off the prospect of a power struggle within the family after his death. But his other children were reportedly blindsided by the move.\nMurdoch worked with a team of high-profile lawyers for the case. Streisand has been involved in estate disputes of multiple celebrities, including Michael Jackson and Britney Spears. The former attorney general William Barr also helped Murdoch with his attempts to rewrite the trust.\nIf the decision holds, it is likely to have a major impact on the future of the rightwing media empire, which includes Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Australian.\nMurdoch, 93, is more politically aligned with Lachlan, his heir apparent. James, Elisabeth and Prudence are regarded as less conservative and James, in particular, has publicly criticized climate denialism in the media and accused US media of “propagating lies” that unleashed “insidious and uncontrollable forces” after the January 6 insurrection. James resigned from his role as a senior executive at News Corp in 2020. That same year, he and his wife donated $600,000 to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.\nMeanwhile, Lachlan, who took over as chair of News Corp in 2023, has privately voiced political opinions similar to his father and has attached himself to the growth in ratings and sales the media empire has seen since Trump’s rise in 2015, according to multiple reports.\nFox’s revenue for fiscal year 2024, which ended over the summer, was nearly $14bn. It is the most-watched cable news show in the US and received a bump in viewers and influence after Donald Trump’s first election in 2016.\nRobert Thompson, a media scholar based at Syracuse University, said even after the court loss, the Murdochs may stick with their empire’s right wing-pleasing business model.\n“The Fox model has worked very well,” said Thompson. Even if all the siblings have shared control, they will still all have to think about the companies’ bottom line.\n“This is such a successful business model that anything that would jeopardize the steady course would be bad for everybody,” Thompson added. “I’m not completely convinced that these Murdochs are going to, in the end, be able to really revolutionize the behemoth that Dad created.”"

    "raw_text": "There’s a reason so many websites dedicate reams of virtual pages to the question of whether a brand-new movie is on Netflix, and when it might turn up there. For many casual viewers, the biggest streaming site is more or less synonymous with streaming itself; even big brand names like Disney+, no-longer-HBO Max, Peacock and Paramount+ are basically playing for second place. But at some point, they might need to concede that it’s really a battle for third at best: last month, all of those aforementioned glossy non-Netflix services were out-viewed by Tubi.\nWhile fancier streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video have been experimenting with ad-supported versions in order to juice revenues (whether from cheaper ad-bearing subscriptions, hoping customers will pay more to avoid ads, or money from the ads themselves), Tubi offers a rotating, ad-supported lineup of movies and TV shows at the unbeatable price of zip. It’s a free service that doesn’t require so much as a sign-in. (I know this firsthand: I’ve been a regular Tubi user for years, and have yet to create an actual account.) Tubi combines the excited browsing of the old video store experience, the instant-gratification appeal of Netflix, and the old-fashioned channel-flipping of cable, where everyone once accepted the built-in ad breaks that came with movie-watching. Apparently, viewers don’t mind introducing a little retro into their streaming experiences; Tubi is still growing in viewership and ad revenue. In its most recent quarter, the latter was up by 22%. (According to the CEO, the service isn’t yet making money, but growth in such a competitive and capricious industry is still notable.)\nEven before these numbers were posted, Tubi was no longer a scrappy upstart; the Fox Corporation – the part of the media conglomerate that wasn’t sold off to Disney, and owns various Fox-branded TV stations – bought the service in 2020. Its essential approach, however, seems to be more or less the same: offer viewers a huge range of ad-supported choices – sometimes even programming that might appear on other, tonier-looking streaming services recently or simultaneously – without pouring nearly so much money into subscriber-baiting marquee originals. There’s actually plenty of Tubi original programming, but that, too, has a retro feel; it’s more what you’d expect from straight-to-cable or direct-to-video exploitation movies in the 90s or early 2000s than, say, HBO. The company is starting to experiment with starrier, higher-profile originals, including a new series starring TV mainstay Lauren Graham, but they seem unlikely to overtake its virtual video store appeal.\nIndeed, a possible secret weapon sometimes unacknowledged in descriptions of Tubi’s rise is the fact that it has tons of movies that are over 30 years old, a relative rarity in many paid streaming services. At the moment, Netflix has two dozen or so pre-1990 movies – and that represents an uptick from some recent months, thanks to their recent anniversary-year initiative that saw them promoting groups of movies from 1974 and 1984. Max does a bit better on average, thanks to their ownership of Turner Classic Movies – but there’s nowhere near the level of depth or variety as there is on the actual TCM (or its terrific cable-subscriber-only streaming app). For other services, a telltale sign can be to look up a genre that’s less prevalent today, like westerns or musicals, and see what they offer. Peacock, for example, has one pre-1990 musical; among Tubi’s choices in this department are the original West Side Story, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Royal Wedding, The Pajama Game, The Jazz Singer, Fiddler on the Roof, Yentl, The Music Man and High Society. It’s not everything you need to know about the genre, surely, but it’s a better start than many more expensive services can provide.\nThis makes Tubi sound like the choice for older folks looking to supplement their MeTV viewing as a means of peering into the past. Yet according to the company, Tubi also has the youngest median age viewership in TV at 39. That “TV” designation probably eliminates some magnets for the youngest media consumers, like TikTok or YouTube, but Tubi’s CEO, Anjali Sud, stressed in a recent interview that the company does have its eye on younger viewers, and considers the company in competition with major alternatives to traditional movies and television, rather than a futuristic version of a particularly well-stocked cable channel.\nThough it’s probably difficult to outstrip YouTube’s reach (and its creators’ endless supply of grasping, algorithm-sharpened thumbnails), the two services make for striking competitors, at least for now. Though you can rent movies and shows through YouTube, the platform has exploded thanks to sui generis content and its creators, who aren’t always steeped in anything more than other YouTube videos and/or the shifting whims of the algorithm that serves them up. This material may variously connect to sketch comedy, talkshows, reality TV, visual essays or animated shorts, among many others, but much of it has its own parameters and genres that can often seem, to outsiders, insulated from history. Tubi, on the other hand, can offer a surprisingly decent crash course in classic cinema, if you’re willing to sit through a few ad breaks (which, again, almost anyone raised on cable TV in the 80s, 90s, and 00s was). Even in months where their specific “classics” section might wane (or the transfers of certain public-domain titles might not be the most pristine), there’s an eclecticism that expands beyond the very recent past and actually rewards curiosity on a tight budget. If streaming is going to rot our brains and keep us indoors, the least it can do is offer a little breadth.\nThat may not be the long-term gameplan, just as Netflix gradually shrank its endless DVD library into a far more finite series of conveniences. In that same interview with the Verge, Sud talks about investing in content creation – not necessarily on a Netflix level, but courting younger voices who might otherwise consider making stuff for the likes of TikTok. On some level, this seems like a potential misread of what their audience is and how to court it, like hiring a juggling clown to perform at a local video store. But if Tubi keeps its large and rotating selection of free movies and shows alongside the less experienced content creators, perhaps it can create a more natural flow between TikTok-style insta-culture and entertainment made by, you know, actual professionals – something that actually capitalizes on the promise of a converged, omnivorous internet. (And maybe the “content creators” can simply replace the shlocky knock-off portion of the Tubi catalog, which is substantial, and probably gooses their selection numbers substantially with the kind of mockbusters and animated Disney imitators you used to find on sale at the drugstore.)\nMaybe that’s a pipe dream of middle age – that somehow, culture will pivot back to a richer sense of history that actually and playfully draws connections between entertainment from different eras. But right now, the brand that’s shorthand for streaming treats theatrical releases with hostility, is tightening the purse strings on their auteur-driven projects, and surfaces shows that seem increasingly unmoored from the craft of making TV. Netflix accidentally created a new, worse kind of monoculture, where choices are few and voracious and unsatisfying binges are encouraged. Imagine a future where instead, we Tubi and chill."

    "raw_text": "Nepal’s government has lifted its ban on 26 prominent social media apps and messaging services after at least 19 people were killed and more than 200 injured in clashes on Monday.\nThe country’s communication and information minister announced the ban would be rolled back hours after demonstrators protesting against the block surged towards the parliament complex in the capital, Kathmandu.\n“We have withdrawn the shutdown of the social media. They are working now,” said the communications minister, Prithvi Subba Gurung.\nOn Monday, thousands of young Nepalese joined “Gen Z” protests across the country, which were triggered by the social media ban but also reflected wider frustrations at the government’s perceived lack of action to tackle corruption and boost economic opportunities.\n“We are protesting against corruption that has been institutionalised in Nepal,” student Yujan Rajbhandari, 24, said.\nIn Kathmandu protesters barged into the parliament complex on Monday, breaking through a barricade and setting fire to an ambulance. Police used water cannon, batons and rubber bullets to control the crowd, while the army was deployed and a curfew imposed in the capital. Protests also spread to smaller cities across the country, which saw similar clashes with police.\nAmnesty International said live ammunition was used and had resulted in deaths and serious injuries of several protesters. Police confirmed that 19 people had died in the protests and hundreds had sustained injures.\n“The law enforcement agencies must only use force where absolutely necessary and it must be strictly proportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved,” Amnesty said in a statement.\nThe prime minister, KP Sharma Oli, said he was saddened by the incidents of violence due to the “infiltration from different selfish centres”. His home minister resigned on Monday night over the killing of protesters.\nThe government had formed a committee to investigate the violence and would pay relief for the families of the dead and provide free treatment for the injured people, he added.\nEven after the social ban was revoked, anti-corruption protests continued late into Monday night and on Tuesday morning. Protesters carried placards with slogans such as “youths against corruption”.\nStudent Ikshama Tumrok, 20, said she was protesting against the “authoritarian attitude” of the government, with the social media ban cited as just one example of overreach by the government.\nNepal’s government said last month that social media firms would be given seven days to register under new regulations, including to establish a point of contact and designate resident grievance and compliance officers.\nMeta’s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Alphabet’s YouTube, China’s Tencent and Snapchat, Pinterest and X all missed the deadline and were subsequently blocked.\nThe government has said social media users make fake IDs and use them to spread hate speech and fake news, commit fraud and other crimes on these platforms.\nPopular online platforms had previously been blocked, including the Telegram messaging app in July. Last year the government lifted a nine-month ban on TikTok in August after the platform agreed to comply with Nepali regulations.\nWith Reuters and Agence France-Presse"

    "raw_text": "At least 19 people have been killed during protests in Nepal over a government ban on dozens of online platforms including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and X.\nThe government has faced mounting criticism after imposing a ban on 26 prominent social media platforms and messaging apps last week because they had missed a deadline to register under new regulations.\nOn Monday, frustration at the ban boiled over on the streets of the capital, Kathmandu, and in smaller cities across the country.\nTens of thousands of largely young people gathered to protest against the ban and over wider allegations of corruption and authoritarianism on the part of the government, led by the prime minister, KP Sharma Oli.\nIn Kathmandu, clashes with police erupted as protesters broke through barriers and attempted to storm the parliament building and set fire to the gate.\nPolice responded with deadly and allegedly indiscriminate force, firing live rounds of ammunition and teargas as well as hitting protesters with batons, rubber bullets and water cannon.\nPolice confirmed at least 19 people had died from serious injuries sustained at the protests, including bullet injuries to the head and chest.\nMost died in the clashes in Kathmandu but two were killed when protests turned violent in the eastern city of Itahari. More than 200 were injured and receiving treatment in hospital.\nThe demonstrations have been labelled the “gen Z protest” in a nod to the youth-led movement that circumvented the social media shutdown to mobilise the masses.\nMany protesters – some out in their school uniforms – sought to emphasise they had taken to the streets as part of a bigger agenda to fight the corruption and nepotism they allege is rampant among Nepal’s political elite, and held up placards with slogans such as “youths against corruption”.\nThe death toll from Monday’s protests intensified anger on the streets and protests continued well into the evening, despite attempts by the government to impose a curfew in areas of unrest. By Monday night, the home minister, Ramesh Lekhak, had resigned in response to the police killings.\nThe UN demanded an immediate probe into the state violence unleashed on the protests.\n“We are shocked by the killings and injury of protesters in Nepal today and urge a prompt and transparent investigation,” UN human rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said in a statement.\nThe almost blanket social media ban came into effect at midnight on Thursday and subsequently caused chaos across the country, affecting businesses and tourism and leaving people unable to communicate with relatives abroad.\nLinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit and Signal were also among the banned sites. TikTok was one of the few not restricted – after it complied with the registration order – and it became a key tool of mobilisation.\nSince the ban, videos contrasting the struggles of ordinary Nepalis with the children of politicians flaunting luxury goods and expensive holidays have gone viral on TikTok, further fuelling anger at the government.\nNepal’s ministry of communications and information technology said it had given social media companies seven days to follow the country’s laws and register after a court order, but all but five had failed to meet the deadline. A notice from the ministry said that subsequently an order had been issued to “deactivate” the platforms.\nThe government said the new regulations were aimed at cracking down on hate speech, fake news and online crimes. The ban had already drawn condemnation from international rights organisations. In a statement, the Committee to Protect Journalists NGO warned that the ban set a “dangerous precedent for press freedom”.\nOn Sunday, dozens of journalists had gathered in Kathmandu to protest against the ban, holding up signs with slogans including “no shutdown of social networks”, “no silencing of voices”, “freedom of expression is our right” and “democracy hacked, authoritarianism back”.\nPrior to Monday’s protests turning violent, the country’s prime minister hit back at critics, saying he would not tolerate the “nation being undermined”.\n“The independence of the nation is greater than the loss of jobs of a handful of individuals. How can it be acceptable to defy the law, disregard the constitution and disrespect national dignity, independence and sovereignty?” Oli said in a speech on Sunday.\nWhile Nepal remains a largely unrestricted country for freedom of expression, critics say there is a growing overreach by the Oli government that has caused concern.\nIn 2023, TikTok was banned for nine months over concerns of hate speech and cybercrime but it was reinstated once the platform agreed to register with the government.\nA series of draft bills governing press freedom and social media are under debate in Nepal’s parliament that could mean people are fined or jailed for content that is deemed against the “national interest”, and could allow the government to shut down newspapers and revoke the licences of journalists."

    "raw_text": "A trove of leaked data from Boris Johnson’s private office reveals how the former prime minister has been profiting from contacts and influence he gained in office in a possible breach of ethics and lobbying rules.\nThe Boris Files contain emails, letters, invoices, speeches and business contracts. They shine a spotlight on the inner workings of a publicly subsidised company Johnson established after leaving Downing Street in September 2022.\nThe trove reveals how Johnson has used the company to manage an array of highly paid jobs and business ventures. They raise questions for the former Conservative leader about whether he has breached “revolving door” rules governing post-ministerial careers.\nThe revelations have echoes of the Greensill Capital lobbying scandal that embroiled one of Johnson’s predecessors, David Cameron. They may also spark questions about the taxpayer-funded allowance that former prime ministers get to run their private offices.\nThere are more than 1,800 files in the cache, including some that date back to Johnson’s tenure in Downing Street. The Guardian is the only UK media organisation known to have viewed the trove.\nThe files reveal:\n-\nJohnson lobbied a senior Saudi official he had met while in office, asking him to share a pitch with the petrostate’s autocratic crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, for a firm he co-chairs.\n-\nThe ex-PM received more than £200,000 from a hedge fund after meeting Venezuela’s president Nicolás Maduro – contrary to statements he was not paid.\n-\nWhile in office, Johnson appears to have held a secret meeting with Peter Thiel, the billionaire who founded the controversial US data firm Palantir, months before it was given a role managing NHS data.\n-\nIn an apparent breach of Covid pandemic rules, Johnson hosted a dinner for a Tory peer who financed a lavish refurbishment of his Downing Street flat, a day after the second national Covid-19 lockdown came into force.\nJohnson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nThe files were obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS), a US-registered non-profit that archives leaked and hacked documents.\nDDoS told the Guardian it did not know the provenance of the leak. However, the appearance of the data on its servers will raise inevitable questions about a breach of security at the former prime minister’s office.\nThe trove mostly postdates Johnson’s term as prime minister, covering a period between September 2022 and July 2024, although it also contains some documents produced when he was in Downing Street.\nDisclosures about how Johnson has forged a lucrative career in the private sector throw into sharp relief a little-known scheme that allows former UK prime ministers to claim government money to pay for expenses “arising from their special position in public life”.\nThe annual six-figure payment, known as the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), is a subsidy intended to support an ex-PM’s public duties. It is not meant to be used for private or commercial activities.\nThe files raise questions about whether Johnson has blurred these lines while running the Office of Boris Johnson, a limited company established a month after he left Downing Street.\nA senior Cabinet Office source confirmed that Johnson has claimed funds under the scheme to pay for staff salaries in his private office. Official data shows he has claimed £182,000 in PDCA payments since leaving government.\nJohnson’s office, the leak reveals, has played a central role in managing his commercial endeavours. These include deals with Daily Mail and GB News, and a globe-trotting career giving speeches for deep-pocketed clients.\nThe cache of files suggest that between October 2022 and May 2024, Johnson was paid approximately £5.1m for 34 speeches. The engagements typically earn him hundreds of thousands of pounds, as well as generous expenses to cover first-class flights and stays in five-star hotels for him and his staff.\nIt is not unusual or against any rules for former prime ministers to travel the world delivering paid speeches, but there are restrictions on business activities they can undertake after leaving government.\nThese include prohibitions on lobbying contacts developed while in office in foreign governments and commercial organisations. Johnson was reminded of these rules by an official watchdog on the day he left Downing Street.\nRevelations from the Boris Files will place pressure on Johnson to explain how some of his recent contacts with foreign governments on behalf of commercial interest fall within the rules."

    "raw_text": "The Boris Files are a trove of leaked data from the office of Boris Johnson, the former prime minister’s private office. The data shines a spotlight on Johnson’s commercial interests since he left Downing Street in September 2022.\nIt reveals how the former Conservative leader is using the relationships he forged in the UK’s highest elected office to facilitate his personal enrichment. He appears to be doing so via his private office, which is subsidised by the public.\nIt raises a number of serious questions for the ex-PM. Has he broken “revolving door” rules that restrict post-ministerial jobs? Did he breach the ministerial code? Has he been misusing public funds for private gain?\nThe leak also contains documents from Johnson’s time in office, raising questions about secret, undeclared meetings and potential breaches of Covid lockdown rules during the pandemic.\nThe Guardian is the only UK media organisation known to have viewed the Boris Files, and the first to have published stories based on the leak.\nWhere did the trove come from? What does it contain? And how has the Guardian decided what should be made public?\nEmails, invoices, spreadsheets\nThe Office of Boris Johnson is a limited company that takes advantage of a scheme that allows former prime ministers to claim a six-figure sum in annual expenses from the Cabinet Office. The money is for administrative and secretarial costs “arising from their special position in public life”.\nAs leaks go, this one is relatively small: approximately 2GB of data, or 1,820 files. It includes emails, letters, invoices, spreadsheets, speeches and business contracts. These mostly postdate September 2022, when Johnson left office, but there are some files covering the entirety of his time in Downing Street.\nThe data was obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoS), which archives data leaks. A US-registered non-profit committed to transparency, DDoS hosts a library of more than 360 data leaks online.\nData hosted by the group has in recent years formed the basis of hundreds of public-interest articles published by outlets including the Guardian, BBC, Washington Post, Financial Times and New York Times.\nDDoS told the Guardian it did not know the provenance of the Boris Files, which it obtained earlier this year.\nThe leak will nonetheless raise security questions about potentially lax security provisions in Johnson’s office, given the data contains some confidential government documents and other sensitive materials.\nIn contrast to WikiLeaks, which was criticised for sometimes dumping raw data online, DDoS limits who can access its most sensitive data. Only approved journalists or researchers can access such leaks, including the Boris Files. Data is hosted on DDoS servers but can be viewed remotely.\nJohnson claims public subsidies via the public duty costs allowance (PDCA), which enables former prime ministers to claim up to £115,000 a year to help fund their office, for example by contributing to salaries. Ex-PMs can also claim a pension allowance to contribute towards the pension costs of their office staff.\nThese funds are not supposed to cover security costs or private interests. The leak raises questions about blurred lines.\nA senior Cabinet Office source confirmed Johnson had claimed PDCA funds to pay for staff salaries in his private office.\nJohnson’s office employs three full-time staff. The data shows that all three have been involved in his commercial or business affairs. So how has Johnson ensured that the £182,000 claimed in PDCA funds has not been used for private gain?\nThe Guardian asked this and other questions of Johnson. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\nThe PDCA was created by Robin Butler, Margaret Thatcher’s loyal cabinet secretary. According to a report in the Times from 1991, it was introduced after friends of Thatcher, by then a backbench MP on a reduced salary, “let the considerable difficulties she faced on leaving office be known at Westminster”.\nThe money was always intended to pay for the public functions expected of former prime ministers, not to subsidise profit-generating business.\nThe private offices of John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May all claim PCDA allowance, as does the office of Liz Truss, to some consternation given she only served for 49 days.\nGiven the minimal oversight over how the money is spent, the Boris Files will fuel calls for greater transparency.\n‘Different expectations’\nThere is no suggestion that any other prime minister has used their private office to drum up business, although some may be using taxpayer-funded staff to arrange paid speeches, and others have certainly faced scrutiny over the manner in which they have sought financial gain after leaving Downing Street.\nBlair was criticised after his consultancy, Tony Blair Associates, advised the kleptocratic leaders of Kazakhstan. Cameron found himself at the centre of a scandal arguably bigger than any he faced in office when it was revealed he had been lobbying former colleagues on behalf of Greensill Capital.\nThere is no suggestion that Cameron’s private office was involved in the Greensill affair. However, last year it became the subject of a decision by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) that confirmed the public’s right to know about private offices run by ex-PMs.\nThe statutory data regulator issued its ruling after the Cabinet Office sought to resist a freedom of information request to release invoices and purchase orders from Cameron’s private office, claiming it contained the personal data of his staff.\nThe ICO ordered the release of some data, concluding there was a “clear and legitimate public interest” in providing the public with an understanding of how PDCA payments are being used by former prime ministers.\nCameron’s staff, the ICO added, “should arguably have different expectations” about what may be disclosed about them, given their company is “partly funded from the public purse and working in support of an ex-prime minister”.\nThe Guardian’s decision to review the Boris Files was based on similar principles. Former prime ministers and their state-subsidised private offices warrant scrutiny. Journalists are not statutory watchdogs, but in a functioning democracy they too have a role to play in holding power to account.\nJournalists must act responsibly, weighing the public interest in the context of legal and ethical considerations. The stories we are publishing from the leak are based on a small proportion of the files.\nThe decision to publish them was the result of careful consideration, after concluding that a sufficient public interest threshold had been met.\nJohnson, like Cameron, is no ordinary private citizen. He is a recently departed prime minister who, much like his predecessor, appears to be profiting lavishly from the privileges bestowed on him through public office. The public has a right to know.\nThe Boris Files reporting team: Harry Davies, Henry Dyer, Pippa Crerar, Tom Burgis, Rowena Mason, Jessica Elgot, Rob Evans and David Pegg."

They raise questions about whether he breached lobbying restrictions imposed on former ministers.\nJohnson’s overtures to the most powerful figures in Saudi Arabia were for Better Earth, a little-known UK-based consultancy firm established by a Canadian mining financier, who co-chairs the company with the ex-PM.\nThe approaches included a lunch and meeting in a private members’ club with an influential Saudi minister whom Johnson had met while in government, files suggest.\nJohnson also personally wrote a flattering letter addressed to Prince Mohammed, telling the de facto Saudi leader he was a “fervent admirer of the vision you have for the kingdom”.\nThe letter is contained in the Boris Files, a cache of leaked documents that shine a light on Johnson’s post-prime ministerial career. The files were obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks.\nThe cache offers an inside view of how Johnson has forged a lucrative career in the private sector after leaving government, using his influence and contacts made while in public office.\nJohnson and Better Earth did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Saudi government also did not respond.\nBetter Earth’s shareholders include seven close associates and advisers to Johnson, including two ex-Conservative ministers and Charlotte Owen, a 32-year-old former aide given a peerage by the ex-PM.\nAs prime minister and, earlier in his career, foreign secretary, Johnson engaged extensively with the government of Saudi Arabia, an authoritarian state that rights groups have long criticised for human rights abuses.\nJohnson met Prince Mohammed on a visit to Riyadh in 2022 and held a series of official calls with the royal while in Downing Street. The pair were reported to have frequently exchanged WhatsApp messages.\nIn his letter addressed to the crown prince last year, Johnson wrote: “I would very much like to explore whether [Better Earth] could be useful to you and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in achieving your ambitions – because I believe it certainly could.”\nOffer of employment\nBetter Earth was founded by a Canadian businessman, Amir Adnani, in late 2023. How Johnson first became involved with Adnani, who runs a multibillion-dollar uranium mining company and has appeared on the former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s podcast, remains unclear.\nThe Observer reported last year that a senior executive at Adnani’s US-based mining group met Johnson while prime minister in May 2022. Adnani posted on social media that Johnson and the executive discussed nuclear power and uranium.\nLess than two years later, Adnani established Better Earth and hired Johnson, who had resigned as prime minister 15 months earlier, to serve as co-chair of the company, a part-time role for which he would receive £120,000 a year as well as an initial 12.5% stake in the business, files suggest.\nThe offer of employment was signed in late January 2024, a day after Johnson visited Riyadh, where he gave a speech and appears to have attended a dinner hosted by the UK’s ambassador.\nAccording to the files, Johnson agreed to begin working for the company on 1 February. Days later, he completed an application form for the watchdog that monitors and approves post-government jobs, telling the body that he planned to start working for the firm in March.\n“I was approached with an offer to be part of this new venture,” Johnson wrote in the application to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). He said he would “represent the company at meetings with potential clients and investors”.\nThe form did not mention that Johnson had by then already agreed to work for the company.\nWhen Acoba approved the role in April 2024, the watchdog imposed conditions, stating that for two years after leaving office Johnson “should not become personally involved in lobbying contacts you developed during your time in office in other governments” to secure business or investment for Better Earth.\nHowever, Johnson had by then already had lunch with the Saudi minister of commerce, Majid al-Qasabi, whom he had earlier met in his capacity as prime minister, during which the new venture was discussed, files suggest.\nJohnson met Qasabi on numerous occasions when in government. At least one meeting occurred at Downing Street, and documents seen by the Guardian suggest Qasabi oversaw Johnson’s trip as prime minister to the kingdom in March 2022. Official photos of the visit show Johnson on an evening tour of Riyadh’s streets with Qasabi walking at his side.\n‘Friend’ in trunks\nLeaked files suggest that after the February 2024 lunch with Qasabi, Better Earth planned for Johnson to send a letter to Prince Mohammed with the minister’s support. In an apparent reference to Qasabi, the company’s CEO wrote: “We have taken all the advice Majid has given us.”\nJohnson appears to have then drafted formal letters to Qasabi and Prince Mohammed later in February 2024. They were prepared with an “Office of Boris Johnson” letterhead. It is unclear when or if they were ultimately sent.\nWriting to the crown prince, Johnson referred to meeting Qasabi years earlier, recalling that his “friend” was “wearing a pair of floral swimming trunks … because we were both diving off the coast of what was then a trackless desert”.\nJohnson continued: “Although I now live a life of blameless rustic obscurity in Oxfordshire, I remain deeply committed to carbon reduction.” He noted that he had “helped run the highly successful” Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in 2021.\n“I now chair a company that offers practical solutions for developing green energy and reducing carbon,” he wrote, explaining that he was “sending a more detailed note” about the company to Qasabi. “But it would of course be a great honour to come to see you and to explain in person.”\n‘Keen to advise and assist’\nAccording to a draft of the accompanying letter to Qasabi, Johnson said Better Earth was “keen to advise and assist” Saudi Arabia on preparing carbon reduction commitments for the UN’s Cop30 climate summit later this year.\nHe wrote that Better Earth was “not just an adviser but a project developer”. He said the company “would be honoured to send our team of experts” to the kingdom to evaluate opportunities to partner on developing “net zero geothermal electricity generation” projects.\n“We would very much like to meet with the appropriate ministerial authorities,” Johnson said. “Our hope is to help [the crown prince] to achieve his ambitions.”\nIt is not clear if Qasabi passed on details of Johnson’s pitch to Prince Mohammed or how exactly the Saudi government, which is a close UK ally, responded to the overtures. However, Qasabi appears to have met the ex-PM several months later, in mid-June 2024.\nFiles suggest the meeting occurred at 5 Hertford Street, a Mayfair private members’ club owned by Robin Birley, a multimillionaire businessman and prominent Brexit supporter.\nWriting to the club, Johnson’s assistant said: “Boris has asked if he might be able to use Robin’s study for a meeting,” and provided details of a small group of expected attenders. The list suggests Better Earth was on the meeting’s agenda.\nAs well as Johnson and Qasabi, Adnani, the ex-PM’s Canadian business partner, planned to attend alongside Chris Skidmore and Nigel Adams, two former Tory ministers who hold shares in Better Earth."

    "raw_text": "From a private jet somewhere over the Caribbean Sea in February last year, Boris Johnson called his old political adversary David Cameron, then the foreign secretary, to notify him of a visit.\nJohnson had taken a day out from a family holiday in the Dominican Republic for an unlikely meeting with the leftwing president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, a man whom Johnson, when in office, had likened to a “dictator of an evil regime”.\nThe other participant in the meeting was less well known: Maarten Petermann, a hedge fund manager.\nWhen later questioned about the meeting, Johnson told UK government officials: “It is not true to say that I was paid for any meetings in Venezuela.” The former prime minister said he had no contractual relationship with the hedge fund Merlyn Advisors.\nJohnson later suggested he had been acting as a diplomatic backchannel, but weeks after attending the 45-minute meeting, the Guardian can reveal, Johnson received £240,000 from Petermann.\nThe revelation is contained in the Boris Files, a leak of data from the office of Boris Johnson, his private office, which receives a taxpayer-funded allowance. The files contain a contract with Merlyn Advisors signed by Johnson months earlier in September 2023.\nThe contract, drawn up by Merlyn, notes that Johnson “over a long career has acquired a unique experience and knowledge of domestic UK government politics and international relations”.\nIt says Merlyn Advisors “interacts with a number of different domestic and international stakeholders which would benefit from the perspectives and the experiences of” Johnson. For each meeting, Johnson was to be paid a fee of £200,000 – worth up to £1.6m a year for eight meetings.\nThe contract was to last two years from October 2023. The company would also pay £35,000 a month to support a thinktank that Johnson was considering setting up in the UK.\nJohnson did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Petermann said: “I have no comment. Please don’t try to put words in my mouth as to whether or not I dispute it.”\nThe Guardian has not confirmed whether the payment made to Johnson was for his visit to Venezuela.\nThe cache does not include a copy of the contract also signed by the company and it is possible it was abandoned after UK officials asked questions about the arrangement.\nHowever, a log of payments suggests that an invoice, which mirrors the contract, was sent by Johnson’s office to Petermann weeks after the meeting with Maduro, an authoritarian president whose government is under investigation by international criminal court prosecutors for alleged crimes against humanity.\nThe invoice, for £200,000 plus an additional £40,000, was sent on 15 March 2024, weeks after the meeting with Maduro. This invoice was paid on 7 May, the document suggests. There are no details of other invoices to Merlyn.\nThe files were obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks. The Guardian is the first media outlet to publish stories based on the leak.\nJohnson has said he was “extensively briefed” by the top UK diplomat in Caracas before the meeting and updated the embassy afterwards.\nHowever, the £240,000 payment raises questions about the true nature of the trip and Johnson’s claims to have acted as a diplomatic backchannel for the UK to open a dialogue with Maduro.\nThe Sunday Times has reported that Johnson did not tell Cameron about Petermann’s involvement in the meeting.\nCameron, who was embroiled in his own post-Downing Street scandal, might have warned Johnson of the perils of using the privileges of his role as a former PM for financial gain. As prime minister, Johnson had launched an official investigation into Cameron’s lobbying for Greensill Capital.\nQuestions about candour\nJohnson faced questions from UK government officials about the Venezuela meeting after a series of reports in early March last year from the Sunday Times and the Financial Times revealing Petermann’s involvement and Johnson’s relationship with the company. But details of the contract and an invoice sent to the company have not previously been reported.\nThe media reports drew the attention of officials at the Whitehall revolving-door watchdog responsible for monitoring the post-government careers of ex-ministers, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba).\nThey wrote to Johnson on 18 March 2024. What seemed confusing to the officials was that Johnson had made an application months earlier, in September 2023. What they had not known – and what is revealed in the leaked files – is that the contract prepared by the hedge fund had been signed by Johnson.\nAt the time, Johnson faced a potential difficulty: he had told Acoba that “no publicity or announcement whatsoever is planned in relation to this role”, but if approval was given by Acoba, his work for the hedge fund would be revealed to the public in a letter published by the watchdog.\nJohnson now faces fresh questions about his candour with the watchdog. He told Acoba he had had no meetings with the hedge fund in his last two years in office.\nIn fact, Johnson had a meeting with Petermann when he was still in office, just over a week before the end of his time as prime minister, leaked documents show.\nThe leaked files reveal they met for a two-and-a-half-hour lunch at Chequers, Johnson’s grace-and-favour country house, on 28 August 2022. Petermann attended alongside a fellow trustee at an animal conservation charity that had hired Johnson’s soon-to-be wife, Carrie, more than a year earlier in January 2021.\nThe lunch with Petermann has not been previously reported and was never disclosed in official transparency registers. The secret lunch raises questions over whether Johnson used his final days as prime minister, and the luxuries of that office, to develop a relationship with a future business interest.\nFourteen months after the Chequers lunch, Johnson told Acoba officials in October 2023 that he had decided not to take up a role with the hedge fund. This came only days after he had signed the contract prepared by Merlyn Advisors. One possibility is that the contract was shelved at the 11th hour after Acoba’s inquiries.\nFor a fortnight in late March 2024, Acoba repeatedly sought clarification from Johnson about his role with the company. He repeatedly denied having a contractual relationship with the company or having been paid for any meetings in Venezuela. He refused to say in what capacity he had met Maduro, or to characterise his relationship with the company.\nThe then chair of Acoba, the Conservative peer Eric Pickles, would later characterise Johnson’s responses as “evasive” and lacking candour. Lord Pickles concluded there remained “a reasonable concern” Johnson was acting for the company in “a capacity that would be considered advisory work” and had breached the rules by failing to properly answer Acoba’s questions.\nJust over a fortnight later, the £240,000 invoice would be marked by Johnson’s staff as paid."

    "raw_text": "Boris Johnson appears to have had a secret meeting with Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of the controversial US data firm Palantir, the year before it was given a role at the heart of the UK’s pandemic response.\nA month after entering No 10, Johnson and his senior adviser Dominic Cummings had a meeting with Thiel, leaked files suggest. Johnson is now likely to face questions about whether the non-disclosure amounts to a breach of the ministerial code.\nThe hour-long afternoon meeting on 28 August 2019 was marked “private” in a log of Johnson’s activities that day and was not subsequently disclosed on the government’s public log of meetings.\nIt took place in Downing Street on the day Johnson had informed the queen he was proroguing parliament in an effort to push through his Brexit plans, triggering a huge backlash.\nThe secrecy around Johnson’s encounter with Thiel raises serious questions about how transparent the government’s public log of meetings has been in recent years.\nIt is unclear why officials did not disclose the meeting between the prime minister, his senior adviser and a tech mogul around the time Thiel’s company was seeking lucrative business with the UK government.\nJohnson and Thiel did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\nThe existence of the meeting is revealed in an official government document contained in the Boris Files, a cache of leaked documents. The files have been seen by the Guardian after they were obtained by the transparency group Distributed Denial of Secrets.\nMeetings carried out in an official ministerial capacity have to be disclosed on the public government log but may be exempt if they are considered political relating to party business, or personal with a friend or family.\nThiel is not a donor to the Conservative party and as an American would not be able to give money to UK politics.\nThat raises questions about the grounds for which the meeting with Thiel was held on a “private” basis, and whether the failure to disclose the meeting could amount to a breach of the transparency requirements outlined in the ministerial code issued by Johnson himself.\nThiel helped fund Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and has accused the NHS of making people sick as well as claiming the UK has “Stockholm syndrome” when it comes to its affection for the health service. He is soon to embark on a four-part lecture series about the “theology, history, literature and politics of the antichrist”.\nThiel co-founded Palantir, which has origins in the CIA, and he remains a significant shareholder. Palantir has grown to have a huge role within the UK health system since 2020, having worked on Ministry of Defence contracts since 2014.\nDuring the pandemic, Palantir worked for £1 on managing data to help with the NHS’s pandemic response. It was given follow-on contracts worth about £60m and is now embedded in the system, having apparently proved its worth to NHS digital chiefs.\nIn 2023, it then landed the biggest IT contract ever awarded by the NHS, for a £330m federated data platform to analyse hospital data and patient information.\nPalantir’s presence in the health system has raised concerns among privacy campaigners, although the NHS insists the government retains ownership of all data. A spokesperson for Palantir defended the company at the time, saying data privacy and security were “always paramount in all of our work”, from supporting the Covid vaccine rollout to waiting list reductions and developing software to help speed up cancer diagnosis.\nPalantir has also come in for criticism in recent months over its supply of technology to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and to help Trump’s mass deportation efforts.\nKeir Starmer toured Palantir’s Washington office in February with its co-founder and chief executive, Alex Karp."

    "raw_text": "Boris Johnson hosted the Tory peer who funded a lavish refurbishment of his Downing Street flat for dinner the day after the second national coronavirus lockdown came into force in an apparent breach of the rules, leaked files suggest.\nDavid Brownlow, who provided £58,000 to cover some of the cost of the renovations, which included £2,260 worth of “gold” wallpaper, joined the then prime minister in the small dining room at No 10 on Friday 6 November 2020.\nJust 24 hours earlier, tough lockdown restrictions banning people from any social meetings indoors, had been introduced to help control the spread of the virus. “Unless we act, we could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day,” Johnson had warned.\nIn WhatsApp exchanges later that month, Johnson messaged Lord Brownlow to complain that parts of his No 11 flat looked a “bit of a tip”, asking him for “approvals” so that his interior decorator Lulu Lytle could “get on with it”.\nHis then ethics adviser, Christopher Geidt, later found that Johnson had not broken the ministerial code over the payments for the Downing Street flat refurbishment but criticised him for acting “unwisely”.\nJohnson’s apparent meeting with Brownlow after lockdown restrictions were imposed is one of several potential further lockdown breaches by the former prime minister revealed in leaked files seen by the Guardian. They raise further questions about Johnson’s integrity during his turbulent three years in office.\nA log of Johnson’s meeting with Brownlow is contained in a cache of files from his private office seen by the Guardian. The leak was obtained by Distributed Denial of Secrets, a US non-profit that archives data leaks.\nJohnson quit as prime minister in July 2022 as Tory MPs turned on him after a series of self-inflicted scandals including the Partygate affair, which resulted in him being fined by the Metropolitan police for breaking lockdown rules.\nHe then stood down as a Conservative MP in June 2023 after an investigation into the Partygate scandal found he had misled parliament and recommended a lengthy suspension from the House of Commons.\nIn a further potential breach, the files also suggest that on Saturday 20 June 2020, the day after the surprise birthday party in the cabinet room that led to his police fine, Johnson and his then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, now his wife, hosted three guests for a “private appointment” at Downing Street.\nA close friend of Carrie’s who specialises in “vibrational” music treatments; the friend’s mother, a fellow natural medicine practitioner; and the journalist Alex Wickham were welcomed in the “flat/garden”, according to a record of the prime minister’s activities that day.\nSocial gatherings indoors were still forbidden in June 2020. At the time, Johnson’s Downing Street denied reports he had celebrated his birthday with family friends in the flat on the evening of 19 June, claiming he had hosted them outside.\nA log of Johnson’s activities the following day, however, indicates the rules may have been broken then. In addition, an entry for 19 June suggests he and Carrie paid a visit to one of her family members who lived in south-west London.\nThe previous week, Johnson had asked the public during a Downing Street press conference to “continue to show restraint and respect the rules which are designed to keep us all safe”.\nIn another possible breach, a heavily pregnant Carrie hosted her close friend Nimco Ali overnight at Chequers, the prime minister’s official country house, on the same day that Johnson announced the first lockdown in March 2020.\n“From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home,” he said in his national address on 23 March. “Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households … You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no.”\nThe leaked files also appear to confirm reports that Johnson hosted a baby shower for his fiancee at Chequers at the start of the pandemic, despite having warned two days earlier that many families would lose loved ones in the “worst public health crisis for a generation”.\nCarrie invited more than a dozen close friends, including three Conservative government aides, to Chequers in Buckinghamshire for the lunch and afternoon tea party on Saturday 14 March 2020, six weeks before the birth of their son.\nJust two days later, Johnson told the public that they should stop non-essential contact with other people and all unnecessary travel. Pregnant women were among those he said should be particularly careful.\nWhen reports of the baby shower first emerged in June that year, Downing Street refused to comment. But a file in the leaked data logging his activities appears to confirm for the first time that the gathering did take place.\nThe confirmation will rekindle speculation that Johnson may have delayed announcing the more stringent advice by several days to avoid having to cancel the baby shower.\nJohnson, his wife, Wickham, Ali, and Brownlow did not respond to requests for comment."

    "raw_text": "The Norwegian Labour party has secured four more years in government after seeing off a surge of support for the populist right in a polarised election.\nSoon after the polls closed, the centre left was projected to win with 89 seats with the centre right taking 80 seats. A minimum of 85 seats are needed for a majority.\nJust two hours later, with 99% of the vote counted, the result had held, according to state broadcaster NRK.\nLabour, led by the prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, had clearly emerged as the largest party, but there was also a big swell in support for the rightwing Progress party, which was projected to have doubled in size in the last four years.\nThe Conservative party, meanwhile, had its worst election in 20 years.\nStøre welcomed the results, playing down any shift to the right. “This is a signal to outside Norway that social democracy can also win despite a right-wing wave,” he told a jubilant crowd of Labour supporters chanting “four more years“.\nThe election was unusually close-fought and polarised, dominated by the cost of living, wealth taxes, oil fund investment in Israel and relations with Donald Trump.\nOn the right, there was a surge in support for the populist Progress party – especially among young men – in what has been described by some as “the Maga-fication” of Norwegian politics.\nThere was also discussion over its leader, Sylvi Listhaug, becoming prime minister in the event of a rightwing victory.\nBut results suggest that Støre, 65, who has been prime minister since 2021, is likely to remain in office, with the former Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, thought to have provided a significant boost for Labour in recent months, as finance minister.\nThis was despite a campaign that was kicked off by strong criticism over the government’s handling of the Norwegian oil fund’s investment in Israel, which could contribute to complex negotiations with smaller leftwing parties to form a government.\nGaute Børstad Skjervø, leader of the AUF, Labour’s youth party, said it was “the comeback of the ages in Norwegian politics”, adding that a year ago the party was “doomed”.\n“Now Støre has secured re-election. I take my hat off to this turnaround,” he said.\nThe Conservative party leader, Erna Solberg, confirmed their defeat, telling her supporters in Oslo: “We can already state that the Conservative party is embarking on a new term in the Storting as an opposition party.”\nSolberg, 64, who was already facing calls to resign, said: “It is my responsibility, and I am incredibly sorry for that.”\nListhaug, 47, reportedly called Støre to congratulate him on his victory.\n“It’s fantastic. We’re doing better than what the polls showed. So it’s incredibly good,” she said. Despite not having secured a majority, she said: “We still have reason to feel like winners today.”\nA record 1.9 million people took part in early voting. By the time polls closed, most of the early votes were reportedly already counted.\nDespite the rise in support for the Progress party, a centre-left victory leaves Norway an outlier from its Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Finland, which are both led by rightwing governments."

    "raw_text": "François Bayrou has been ousted in a confidence vote after only nine months as prime minister, collapsing his minority government and plunging France into a political crisis.\nBayrou, 74, will hand his resignation to Emmanuel Macron, his longterm centrist ally, on Tuesday morning.\nThe French president now faces the challenge of appointing his third prime minister in only one year, and the fifth since he began his second term of office in 2022. His office said he would make the decision “in the coming days”.\nBayrou was toppled when 364 deputies voted that they had no confidence in the government. Just 194 gave him their confidence. Bayrou had called the vote himself as a last-ditch gamble for support, saying he needed backing from parliament for austerity measures to reduce the public debt.\nIn a speech to parliament before the vote, Bayrou had said France was under threat from its “inexorable swamp of debt” and must find a “compromise” on a budget. He said if some “minimal” understanding and consensus was not found in the divided parliament then “government action will be destined to fail”.\nWhen the leaders of opposition party groups, from the left to the far right, made fiercely critical speeches against him, he said: “I won’t respond to insults” and warned that the image of verbal “violence and contempt” among politicians was damaging democracy.\nMarine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally’s parliamentary group told MPs that Bayrou’s departure was “the end of the agony of a phantom government”.\nLe Pen, who was found guilty in March of the embezzlement of European parliamentary funds through a fake jobs scam and banned from running for office for five years, said Macron must call a parliamentary election immediately, even if it meant she could not run again for her seat in northern France. She has appealed against her conviction and an appeal trial will begin in January.\nMacron, who stunned the political world by calling a snap parliament election last year which resulted in a chamber divided into three blocs – left, centre and far right – has expressed reluctance to call another vote. The far right leads the polls and a new election could result in a similar hung parliament.\nPoliticians on the left, which won the most seats in last year’s election, but fell well short of an absolute majority, have said Macron should appoint a prime minister from their camp.\nDuring Monday’s debate, Boris Vallaud called Macron “a defeated president” who he held responsible for “impoverishing the poor, enriching the rich and turning his back on the future”.\nThe Socialist MP said Bayrou’s decision to call the vote was not “an act of courage, but a cop-out”.\nMathilde Panot of La France Insoumise, a leftwing party, said Bayrou had been “severely beaten”. She added: “He wanted his hour of truth; he got it.”\nPanot said that as just a third of parliament had given its confidence to Bayrou, Macron’s economic policies had a minority of support and he should also resign. The president, whose term ends in 2027, has always ruled out stepping down.\nAs head of state with authority on foreign policy and national security, Macron directly appoints a prime minister to run domestic affairs. But since last year’s election there has been no absolute majority in the national assembly, creating a form of political deadlock and disagreement on the budget. This means there is no certainty that a new prime minister would be safe from being ousted.\nFrance is facing a day of protest actions on Wednesday organised online by a movement called “Block Everything”, which could see roads, schools and businesses shut down. Public sector strikes are to follow.\nThe priority for Macron is to appoint a prime minister able to push through a budget for 2026.\nBayrou’s unpopular plan for a €44bn (£38bn) budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt is now certain to be shelved, including his contested proposal to scrap two public holidays. Any new government will return to the drawing board.\nBayrou is the second PM to fall since the snap election in June last year – the rightwing Michel Barnier was ousted after just three months in December. Bayrou had become the most unpopular French prime minister since 1958, largely over his unpopular budget but also his perceived lack of government action.\nHis popularity had also been dented by his stance on an abuse scandal at the Bétharram private Catholic school near his home in south-west France.\nBayrou sent several of his children to the school, where his wife also taught catechism. A parliamentary report in July found Bayrou failed to act to prevent physical and sexual abuse at the school when he served as education minister between 1993 and 1997.\nBayrou was questioned by a parliamentary inquiry about whether he knew about abuse at Bétharram and covered it up. He said he had “hidden nothing”, saying his foes were leading a political campaign of “destruction” against him.\nHis criticisms of the parliamentary inquiry cost him support on Monday night even among his own centrists.\nThe northern politician Violette Spillebout, who co-chaired the parliamentary inquiry, said that despite being a fellow centrist, she abstained in the confidence vote out of anger at Bayrou’s comments on TV this weekend that the parliamentary inquiry was a “political tribune”. She said his comments were an “insult to victims”."

    "raw_text": "François Bayrou, the new French prime minister, calls himself a country man. A tractor-driving “son of the soil” and breeder of thoroughbreds, he has run for president three times, saying his rural roots and centrist politics led him to try to find common ground between left and right.\nBorn to a family of farmers in the Béarn, Bayrou’s more than 40-year political career is built on his insistence on never cutting ties to the area of his childhood at the foot of the Pyrenees in south-west France.\nHe grew up in the small village of Bordères, between the Catholic pilgrimage shrine of Lourdes and Nay, the birthplace of the beret. A Catholic and father of six, he still has a home in the village and is mayor of the south-western city of Pau, 20km away.\nThe 73-year-old has carefully built an image as a country intellectual. When he was a child, he had a stammer and a doctor predicted he would never be able to perform on the stage, be a teacher or a politician – he later said he was proud to have done all three.\nHe studied classics, taught in a state school and is a biographer of the 16th- and 17th-century French king Henri IV. He was education minister during presidencies of the Socialist François Mitterrand and the rightwing Jacques Chirac. He gained notoriety during his 2002 campaign for president when, on a walkabout in a neighbourhood of Strasbourg, a child allegedly tried to pick his pocket and he slapped him in the face. The incident led to a rise in his poll ratings.\nBayrou is head of the centrist MoDem party, which has been part of Macron’s centrist alliance since 2017. During the 2017 presidential race, Bayrou’s support of the young Macron was seen as key to him winning the election. Having at first criticised Macron, a former banker, for representing the interests of money, Bayrou later allied with him, pushing for more proportional representation in French politics. He has remained a close confidant ever since.\nBayrou was named justice minister by Macron in 2017. But he resigned soon after when an embezzlement case was opened against him and members of his party. They were accused of using European parliament money intended for parliamentary assistants to instead fund party work in France.\nIn February this year, Bayrou was cleared in the case, with the judge ruling that he was owed the “benefit of the doubt”. Two others were cleared and eight people were convicted. But the state prosecutor has appealed against all three acquittals, which means that Bayrou will face a retrial, the date of which has not yet been set.\nBayrou ran for president in 2002, 2007 and 2012, and could attempt to run again.\nIn 2012, he was seen by Nicolas Sarkozy’s rightwing campaign as a “traitor” for saying he would vote for the Socialist François Hollande in the final round.\nBayrou has said that his aim in politics is to “talk to everyone” from all parties."

    "raw_text": "As the French president, Emmanuel Macron, faces a crucial moment on the international stage this month, with the recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN assembly and diplomacy over Gaza and Ukraine, he has once again been shaken by a damaging political crisis at home.\nThe centrist prime minister, François Bayrou, was toppled on Monday night in a parliamentary confidence vote, leaving Macron scrambling to appoint his third prime minister in a year, and the fifth since his second term as president began in 2022.\nThis summer, Macron said France needed stability at home while playing a key role on the international stage. But that stability is proving elusive.\nSince Macron’s gamble of calling a snap election last June, the parliament remains divided between three groups – the left, the centre and the far right – none of which has a majority. This has created deadlock on economic policy and divisions over the most basic political task: setting a budget for 2026.\nBayrou fell because of his unpopular austerity budget to curb public debt. France must now urgently agree a budget for next year. But there is no certainty that any new prime minister chosen by Macron could achieve budget consensus or indeed escape being similarly ousted. Bayrou lasted barely nine months and, before him, the rightwing Michel Barnier was toppled after only three.\nEven if Macron were to call another snap election – which is not his favoured choice with Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally leading in the polls – parliament could probably remain just as divided and deadlocked, without a clear majority.\nMacron, whose presidency runs until 2027, might now chose a prime minister closer to the centre-left. But that would be difficult because the president refuses to budge on his economic agenda, dating from 2017, which has included tax cuts on businesses, scrapping the wealth tax and raising the pension age. All of these the Socialists want to roll back.\nMacron might instead again look towards the centre right for a prime minister who could keep on board the rightwing Les Républicains party, which has propped up the minority government so far. But they would face the same budget rows.\nAlexandra Roulet, an associate professor of economics at the Insead business school, who advised Macron from 2022 to 2023, said political parties remained deeply divided on the budget and how to deal with France’s growing public debt.\nRoulet said: “The Socialists would say we’re in this [debt] situation because Macron cut taxes massively since 2017, which means that to fix that, tax should be increased, particularly on the rich. Macron’s centrists would say, we cut taxes but France has become more business-friendly … and we’re in this situation because of public spending going out of control, an ageing population and pension issues. The far right would say we’re in this situation because too much money is being spent on immigration.”\nShe said: “What’s worrying is that we are in a trajectory where every year the debt is projected to increase. You would want it to be stabilised. For that you’d need a budget that both decreases spending and probably increases taxes a bit, taking some money from everywhere: a consolidation budget. But it seems to be very difficult politically for there to be any consensus on a consolidation budget. I think things are going to be unstable until the end of this presidential term.”"

    "raw_text": "The French prime minister, François Bayrou , has surprised France by calling a sudden confidence vote on 8 September, saying he needs backing from parliament for austerity measures to reduce the public debt.\nBayrou is almost certain to lose the gamble. All opposition parties from the far right to the left have said they will vote to topple the prime minister and his minority government after only nine months in office.\nThis would create a fresh political crisis. The French president, Emmanuel Macron , would have to decide whether to swiftly choose a replacement prime minister, while any new appointee could face the same difficulties as Bayrou in securing support.\nMacron could instead call a snap parliamentary election, but he recently said he was reluctant to do so. Last year’s snap election resulted in a divided parliament where no political grouping has an outright majority.\nWhy has Bayrou called a confidence vote now? Bayrou, a centrist and long-term Macron ally, was struggling to get support for his unpopular plan for a €44bn budget squeeze and austerity programme to reduce France’s public debt. His proposals, including scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare spending, were contested across the political class.\nBayrou knew he was facing a difficult autumn: he would have to force through the 2026 budget without a parliament vote and was likely to be toppled by a no-confidence motion in the coming months. Calling his own confidence vote on 8 September was a way of jumping before he was pushed. He is the least popular prime minister since 1958, with one poll this summer showing 80% of French people did not trust him.\nBayrou was also braced for anti-government demonstrations and strikes on 10 September against his budget plans, which officials feared might grow to resemble the gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protest movement of 2018 and 2019.\nWill Macron appoint a new prime minister? If Bayrou falls, the most likely scenario is Macron chooses another prime minister. But it is not certain who, and they may have the same difficulties as Bayrou and struggle to pass a 2026 budget.\nOne year ago, Macron appointed the rightwing Michel Barnier as prime minister, but parliament ousted him only three months later over budget disagreements. His replacement, Bayrou, will have lasted nine months by the time of the vote.\nSince Macron called an inconclusive snap election last June, the French parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A left alliance won the largest number of seats but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron’s centrist grouping took losses but is still present; and the far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical voting from the left and centre.\nThe Green leader, Marine Tondelier , said this week that Macron must now appoint a prime minister from the left. But the rightwing party Les Républicains, which has propped up the current government, would oppose that.\nNames that have previously circulated as potential prime ministers include the defence minister, Sébastien Lecornu, who was on the right before joining Macron’s centrists, and the former Socialist prime minister Bernard Cazeneuve.\nCould there be a snap parliament election? Macron gambled on a snap parliamentary election last summer in an attempt to head off the far right and bolster his authority, but the move backfired and parliament was left deadlocked. Macron told Paris Match earlier this month that he did not intend to hold another snap election.\nThe justice minister, Gérald Darmanin, said this week that a snap election could not be ruled out. Some members of Macron’s centrist camp believe calling a parliamentary election may be the only solution, while others are opposed.\nMarine Le Pen is pushing for a snap election in the hope that her far-right National Rally party could gain seats. In last year’s snap election, the far right gained ground but was held back in the final round by tactical voting and a left alliance. If an election is called, it is likely that Macron’s centrist grouping would lose seats.\nA majority of French people want parliament to be dissolved and a fresh parliamentary election, according to polls by Ifop, Elabe and Toluna Harris Interactive.\nCould Macron resign? Macron’s second term as president runs until spring 2027 and he has always ruled out resigning. There were calls this week from some on the left, right and far right for Macron to resign but this is not expected.\nIf the prime minister falls, would it affect the small boats crisis, as growing numbers cross the Channel from France to the UK? If Bayrou is ousted, the current French government would stay in place in a temporary, caretaker capacity to run domestic affairs until a new government is formed. This means policies on small boats would continue, including French policing of the northern coast, where people are departing for the UK.\nKeir Starmer announced a “one in, one out” returns deal with France earlier this year whereby the UK would send some people arriving by small boat back to France in exchange for asylum seekers with links to Britain. That will continue.\nFrench maritime authorities are continuing to study the possibility of a legal extension of French policing powers to the shallow waters off northern beaches, to prevent boats from departing."

    "raw_text": "She has said she will appeal against the verdict and sentence, which also included a four-year prison term – with two years suspended and two to be served outside jail with an electronic bracelet – and €100,000 (£84,000) fine.\nWhat was Marine Le Pen found guilty of? Le Pen was “at the heart” of a carefully organised “system” of embezzlement of European parliamentary funds, according to the ruling by Bénédicte de Perthuis, a judge specialising in financial crimes.\nFrom 2004 to 2016, taxpayer money allocated to members of the European parliament to pay their assistants based in Strasbourg or Brussels was instead siphoned off by the far-right National Rally (RN) party, then called Front National, in order to pay its own party workers in France.\nThe staff in France had no connection to work undertaken at the European parliament.\nThe court found there was “no doubt” about the existence of the scheme which “under cover of fictitious contracts” served to “remunerate people who actually worked for the party or the party leaders” in France. This was estimated to have caused a loss to European funds of €4.8m (£4m).\nLe Pen, who was a member of the European parliament from 2004, as well as head of the party from 2011, was found guilty of directly organising eight fictitious contracts worth about €474,000. But the court said she was also at the centre of “instigating” the wider fake jobs scheme which she undertook with “authority” and “determination”.\nMarine Le Pen calls embezzlement conviction a 'nuclear bomb' – video Who else was convicted? Eight other European parliament members for RN were found guilty of being part of the scheme, alongside 12 people found to have had fictitious contracts as parliamentary assistants. Two accountants and the party treasurer were also convicted.\nThose found to have been paid for party work under fictitious European parliament assistant contracts included the full-time bodyguard of Le Pen’s late father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, as well as his personal secretary. Also convicted was Marine Le Pen’s sister, Yann Le Pen, who in fact worked on events for the party’s central office in France.\nWhat did they do with the money? Le Pen and those convicted did not gain any personal financial benefit. The judge ruled “there was no personal enrichment”, but rather “enrichment of the party”.\nThe embezzlement scheme channelled money to fund Front National, which was in financial “difficulty”, the judges found. The party made “large savings” by paying its centralised staff in France with European funds. Among documents cited in evidence by the judges was an email sent in June 2014 from the party treasurer to Le Pen outlining the party’s financial troubles, saying: “We’ll only get through if we make big savings thanks to the European parliament …”\nThe court said the salaries paid from European parliamentary funds to party workers were “comfortable” amounts which the party could otherwise not have paid. The system had allowed a comfortable working life for party leaders, such as the party founder, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who had a secretary and bodyguard. He had been accused of being part of the scheme but did not stand trial due to ill health. He died , aged 96, in January.\nOn what evidence did the court reach its verdict? The judges said a broad range of evidence showed the contracts were fictitious and work was not carried out for the European parliament, but instead for the party.\nThe judges cited a 2014 email from one member of the European parliament, who had previously been a lawyer, to the party treasurer: “What Marine is asking is equivalent to us signing for fictitious jobs …” He warned this was likely to be spotted. “I think Marine knows all that …” the treasurer replied.\nDuring the trial, the court heard that one party worker wrote in an email: “I’d like to see the European parliament and that would also allow me to meet the member of the European parliament I’m attached to.” He had apparently never been to the European parliament where he was supposed to have been working for four months.\nDid Le Pen admit guilt? No. During the trial Le Pen, like the others accused, told the court she was innocent. She said: “I have absolutely no sense of having committed the slightest irregularity, or the slightest illegal act.” After the verdict she repeated she was innocent and said she would appeal.\nThe judges noted in their verdict that the accused “had not expressed any conscience of their violation of the law nor the importance of integrity”."

It marked an unprecedented success for a far-right party in France in the years since the second world war.\nBut then came the fightback. Leftwing parties – from greens to socialists – banded together and encouraged their supporters to vote tactically, even withdrawing candidates so there would be no split political allegiances.\nFrench voters responded.

    "raw_text": "France has been plunged into political crisis after a no-confidence vote brought down the government, ending the beleaguered minority coalition of the rightwing prime minister Michel Barnier after only three months.\nThe no-confidence motion brought by an alliance of left-wing parties was supported by MPs from Marine Le Pen’s anti-immigration, far-right, National Rally. A total of 331 lawmakers — a clear majority — voted on Wednesday night to bring down the government.\nBarnier will resign as prime minister on Thursday morning, having warned before the vote that France would be “plunged into the unknown”.\nMacron will then address the nation in a televised address on Thursday evening, his office said after the vote.\nThe toppling of the government leaves the president, Emmanuel Macron, facing the worst political crisis of his two terms as president. There is uncertainty over how a 2025 budget can be decided as France faces a growing public deficit, and over whom Macron could appoint as prime minister.\nMacron, whose second term as president runs until spring 2027, is not obliged to stand down himself. He has ruled out resigning, calling such a scenario “political fiction”. But part of the left and far right called for his exit.\nWednesday’s vote was the country’s first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou’s government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president. The lifespan of Barnier’s government became the shortest of any administration of France’s Fifth Republic, which began in 1958.\nNo new parliament elections can be called before July 2025, narrowing Macron’s options faced with a deeply divided national assembly.\nSince Macron called a sudden and inconclusive snap election in June, the French parliament has been divided between three groups with no absolute majority. A left alliance took the largest number of votes but fell short of an absolute majority; Macron’s centrist grouping suffered losses but is still standing and Le Pen far-right National Rally gained seats but was held back from power by tactical voting from the left and centre.\nBarnier, the EU’s former Brexit negotiator, was appointed by Macron in September after two months of political paralysis this summer.\nBarnier’s key task, which proved his downfall, was to vote through a budget for 2025 in which he said he would begin to tackle France’s deficit with €60bn in tax increases and spending cuts. But after weeks of standoff over the budget, Barnier on Monday pushed through a social security financing bill, using article 49.3 of the constitution, which allows a government to force through legislation without a vote in parliament. This sparked a no-confidence motion brought by the left alliance, and another brought by the far right.\nBarnier’s minority coalition had been essentially propped up by Le Pen, who, although outside government, had an unprecedentedly powerful role as Barnier attempted to placate her to avoid her party joining a no-confidence vote. Barnier had negotiated with her directly, tapering the budget to her demands.\nBut Le Pen pulled rank, saying Barnier’s budget was a danger to the country. She said French people had expected Barnier’s appointment to calm government institutions and provide a “vision for the country”. Instead, she said, the budget was a disaster.\nLe Pen wrote on social media that, by following the “catastrophic continuity of Emmanuel Macron”, Barnier, who led a coalition dominated by the right and centre, “could only fail”. She said she was “protecting and defending” her party’s 11 million voters, who she said were deeply concerned about the cost of living. Jean-Philippe Tanguy, a National Rally MP, said: “[Having] no budget is better than the actual budget, which says a lot about how bad it is.”\nIf parliament does not pass a budget by 20 December, the government can propose emergency legislation that would roll over spending limits and tax provisions from 2024, pending the arrival of a new government and a new 2025 budget bill.\nThe savings through spending cuts, and tax rises planned by the Barnier government would be shelved.\nLe Pen’s party has said households would be better off in this scenario. Barnier had fiercely contested this, saying that the government’s collapse would bring “extremely serious and turbulent conditions on financial markets”. Barnier’s ministers said more people would end up paying tax or additional tax if thresholds could not be adjusted for inflation. The labour minister, Astrid Panosyan-Bouvet, said there would be “sadness and worry” after a government collapse.\nThe head of the parliament’s finances commission, Éric Coquerel, a member of Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s leftwing La France Insoumise party, said the no-confidence vote was a sign of “hope” and he felt the “vast majority of French people backed it”. He said Barnier was being “alarmist” when he said that “financial and economic chaos” would be the result if the government fell. Mélenchon, who is not currently an MP, was in parliament, to witness what he called a “historic day”.\nThe left alliance’s no-confidence motion contained wording that attacked the far right. It noted that despite a large number of French citizens choosing to block the far right in June’s parliament snap election, Barnier had still “ceded to their most vile obsessions” – a reference to their anti-immigration stance. But Le Pen’s party said it would still vote for the no-confidence text as the key issue was to overthrow the government.\nThe Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, who said there should now be a prime minister from the left, said Macron must speak to the French people. “How can he leave the French people in this uncertainty just before Christmas?” Faure told Le Monde."

    "raw_text": "When 14-year-old Pascal Gélie saw a brochure for an elite French Catholic boarding school boasting swimming in summer and skiing in winter, he begged his parents to send him. He had just watched the American school drama Dead Poets Society and was expecting “sport and friendship”.\n“On the first night, I realised I’d made a terrible mistake,” said Gélie, now a 51-year-old office-worker in Bordeaux. “There were 40 of us in a dormitory with decrepit mattresses. When I whispered to another boy for some toilet paper to take to the bathroom, the supervisor grabbed me by the face and pointed to the stone terrace outside. Someone told me to take my coat because you could be forced to stand outside for hours in the cold and damp. I was made to stand there all night.”\nHe said: “That was just the start: regular blows to the head, children hit so hard they were bloodied and knocked unconscious. I saw one boy’s hair ripped out. One was hit so hard, he lost 40% of his hearing. Sometimes we would all be made to stand beside our beds for hours at night because someone whispered, or our beds were upturned with us in them. It was absolute terror.”\nGélie is part of a group of former pupils at the private Catholic school, Notre-Dame de Bétharram, whose accounts of violence, rape and sexual assault have exposed what is thought to be the biggest school child abuse scandal in French history. The education minister, Élisabeth Borne, has called it a #MeTooSchools moment.\nA French parliamentary inquiry has heard months of testimony on Bétharram, which is located in the foothills of the Pyrenees near the pilgrimage town of Lourdes, and other private schools and children’s homes across France. On Wednesday the inquiry is due to publish its report and 50 recommendations on preventing violence in education. It is expected to be damning on the French state’s failure to protect children.\nThe Bétharram scandal has also become a political challenge to the prime minister, François Bayrou, who sent several of his children to the school, where his wife also taught catechism. Bayrou’s daughter, now 53, recently revealed she was brutally beaten on a summer camp linked to the school but did not tell her father. Bayrou, who was education minister from 1993 to 1997 and held local political roles, was questioned by the inquiry about whether he knew about abuse at Bétharram and covered it up. He said he had “hidden nothing”, saying his foes were leading a political campaign of “destruction” against him.\nIn total, 200 legal complaints have been filed accusing Bétharram priests and staff of physical or sexual abuse from 1957 to 2004. Ninety complaints allege sexual violence or rape. Two complaints have led to charges against a former supervisor over the alleged sexual assault of a minor in 2004 and alleged rape of a minor from 1991 to 1994. He has been placed in custody while the investigation continues. Many other accusations were past the time-limit for prosecution. Gélie said: “We want a change in the law to remove time limits for reporting child abuse.”\nBoris, 51, who now works in events management, said: “Bétharram was like a supermarket for sexual predators and those of us who were sexually abused or raped often had the same profile: vulnerable children with separated or deceased parents.” From a poor, single-parent family in Bordeaux, he was sent to Bétharram aged 13, ironically because his mother wanted to protect him; at 12, he had been targeted by a grooming gang in Bordeaux who befriended him at his local swimming pool and sexually abused him over several months.\nBoris, who did not want his surname published, said: “My mother wanted to get me away from Bordeaux so we begged the Bétharram school principal for a place. To persuade him, I told him about the abuse I’d endured, including the horrible detail that my attacker always handed me an envelope containing 50 French francs [the equivalent of €7, or £6].”\nSix months after Boris was admitted to Bétharram, the same school principal, Pierre Silviet-Carricart, a priest, called him into his office on his 14th birthday and sexually assaulted him, he said. “Then he handed me an envelope containing 50 francs,” Boris said. “The cynicism and cruelty of that …”\nCarricart was also accused of targeting an 11-year-old pupil whose father had just died in a road collision. The boy’s mother, Martine, arranged to travel to the school to collect him at 6am on the day of his father’s funeral. Martine, now 71, who does not want her surname published, said: “Before I arrived, Father Carricart woke my son and took him to the priests’ shower-room where he told him to wash to look nice for the funeral. Then, in that bathroom, he submitted my son to a terrible sexual attack.”\nMartine’s son did not tell her about the abuse but she noticed his extreme anguish. She said: “At the crematorium, he was distraught. He lay on his father’s coffin and tried to open it. He said: ‘I want to go with Dad.’”\nA decade later, in 1997, aged 21, Martine’s son was arrested for exposing himself. He broke down in police questioning and for the first time spoke about repeated sexual abuse at Bétharram. A police investigation was opened for rape and sexual assault of a minor. Carricart, who denied the allegations, was charged and placed in pre-trial detention.\nBut to the surprise of the lead investigator on the case, Carricart was released after two weeks, and was subsequently allowed to move to Rome. After French police contacted him for questioning over a second complaint filed in 2000, Carricart killed himself. Bayrou was asked by the parliamentary inquiry whether he had sought information on the case from the investigating magistrate and potentially intervened. He denied intervening in any way.\n“My son’s life has been destroyed by this,” Martine said. “At 49, he has no family life, no job. He has been in so many psychiatric units. His skin is damaged from constantly scrubbing himself.”\nThe organisation of priests that ran the school at Bétharram said in March that it accepted responsibility for the “suffering” of former pupils, and had launched an independent inquiry into what it called “massive abuse” over decades.\nMeanwhile, Gélie and the French survivors group have launched their own appeal for anyone affected internationally to contact them. The Bétharram order was a missionary order present across the world, from the UK to Brazil, Thailand and Ivory Coast. “We think this goes far beyond France,” Gélie said.\nAnother of those grappling with what he called the “lifelong impact” of the abuse is Laurent, a public sector worker who said he was sexually assaulted in a priest’s office and was once punched unconscious for throwing a snowball in the wrong direction in the playground. He has filed a legal complaint for verbal and physical violence and sexual assault.\n“The violence wasn’t just a slap, it was being beaten to the point of unconsciousness,” said Laurent, now 56. “In my two years at the school, it was constant humiliation, violence and assaults – the impact of that is lifelong. I’m speaking out now to make sure this can never happen to any child again.”"

    "raw_text": "The French prime minister, François Bayrou, failed to act to prevent physical and sexual abuse at a private Catholic school in south-west France when he served as education minister between 1993 and 1997, a parliamentary report has said.\nThe damning report issued by French lawmakers on Wednesday comes after a long parliamentary inquiry into allegations of decades of physical abuse, rape and sexual assault at the Notre-Dame de Bétharram boarding school near Pau in south-west France.\nThe lawmakers also heard from survivors’ groups from many other schools across France, describing how children had been subjected to “monstrous [and] terrible crimes” of “unprecedented severity and of absolute sadism.”\nThe report found what it called “persistent” violence in public and private schools across France and accused the state of failing to act.\nBayrou, 74, has in recent months faced accusations from opposition lawmakers in parliament that as education minister he knew of physical and sexual abuse at the Notre-Dame de Bétharram school, to which he sent some of his children and where his wife taught catechism. He has denied any wrongdoing, saying he only found out about the allegations of abuse from the media.\nThe two co-rapporteurs of the parliamentary inquiry, the centrist MP Violette Spillebout and the leftwing MP Paul Vannier, said he had not acted to address the issue of violence at Bétharram when he was education minister in the 1990s.\nThe report said: “In the absence of action that the former education minister … had the means to take, this physical and sexual violence against the pupils of Bétharram continued for years.”\nVannier told a parliament press conference on Wednesday that there had been major “failings” by the French state, the justice system and the education ministry, which failed to implement proper checks and controls. He said these failings were at every level “from the local level right up to the highest levels of state”.\nVannier said the report found that Bayrou would have known about physical violence at the Bétharram school from 1995 and sexual violence from 1998. Vannier said: “At the time he had all the means to act and he didn’t act.”\nVannier told the state broadcaster France Inter: “Many of the testimonies we received were beyond my imagination. I couldn’t imagine acts of torture, children being injected with water, children being deprived of sleep, children being deprived of food to punish them in endless sadistic games for years and years, devastating entire lives.”\nA member of Bayrou’s team rejected the findings accusing the prime minister of inaction. “It’s exactly the opposite,” the official told Agence France-Presse on condition of anonymity. “No minister after François Bayrou organised any verification checks or inspections.”\nBayrou, a centrist who was appointed prime minister by the president, Emmanuel Macron, in December, has denounced what he calls a political campaign of “destruction” against him.\nIn mid-May, Bayrou was questioned for five and a half hours by the parliamentary inquiry, in one of the most delicate moments of his time in office. He struck a defiant tone at the time, telling the hearing: “I had nothing to hide.”\nThe report found the violence at Bétharram school was systemic. The violence “was – at least in part – institutionalised”, with “a community of prominent figures providing unwavering support”, the lawmakers found.\nThey stressed that the abuse at Bétharram was “far from being a unique case”.\nSuch violence still persisted in private schools, particularly Catholic establishments, the authors said, pointing to a “strong code of silence”.\nThe report warned of “virtually nonexistent” checks and an inadequate system of prevention and reporting by the state. They called for a compensation fund for victims and an end to all time limits on filing a legal complaint for child sexual abuse.\nAlain Esquerre, a former Bétharram pupil who exposed abuse at the school and brought together survivors to fight for justice, said it was urgent that all victims of school abuse got state recognition and parliament must pass a law removing a time limit for legal complaints over child sexual abuse."

The load will produce two 40kg wheels of parmigiano reggiano that will age for a minimum of 12 months, one of the rules for a cheese made exclusively in this designated area of northern Italy. Using a stencilling band, the rind is engraved with the brand, the dairy’s identification number and month and year of production within the first few hours of the wheel’s formation.\nThe visit occurred a few weeks after the US president had reached a trade tariff agreement with Brussels. The deal imposed a 15% cap on most exports from the EU to the US – modest compared with the 30% Trump originally threatened but still a significant hike for most Italian exporters.\nThe case for Alai and his fellow parmigiano reggiano producers is somewhat unique as the agreement simply meant they reverted to the same duty paid since the mid-1960s. But only after being forced to temporarily grin and bear 25% while the deal was being thrashed out, leading to a reduction in orders owing to the stockpiles amassed by importers in the US even before Trump announced his “liberation day”in April.\n“It’s too early to say what the impact of those four months will be due to the surplus [of orders] in the past,” said Alai. “But there was a lot of concern because producers risked sending orders not knowing if they would arrive or how much the tariff would be by the time they got there.”\nWhile the US-EU agreement brought some relief, worries persist about the long-term impact on trade with the US, Alai said, especially when combined with a 13.5% devaluation of the dollar against the euro, which increases the price paid by US consumers.\n“Now we fear the currency exchange rate more than the 15% tariff,” he added.\nStill, he spares a thought for his cheesemaking counterparts across the border in Switzerland, who’ve been dealt a far harsher blow.\nJust as the ink was drying on the EU deal, Italy’s northern neighbour was thrown into turmoil after Trump inflicted a staggering 39% on Swiss imports – the fourth highest imposed on any country, behind Syria (41%), Laos and Myanmar (40%), India and Brazil (both 50%).\nA peaceful country that ordinarily stays out of global conflicts, the feeling of bewilderment was palpable even on the cross-border train journey between Milan and Lausanne. Rolling his eyes, one Swiss passenger accused the EU of “surrendering” to Trump. “Nobody is brave enough to stand up to him,” he said. Others saw it as a punishment for Switzerland’s wealth and innovative business prowess.\nFrom Lausanne, the Guardian travelled to Peney-le-Jorat, a village in the canton of Vaud, to meet René Pernet, a producer of Gruyère, another renowned wheeled cheese with a protected status, a rich history and strong exports to the US, where it is a favoured ingredient in high-end sandwiches or as a topping for crackers.\nPernet – whose Gruyère dairy, called Haut-Jorat, was also passed down through the generations – is still reeling. “There is a lot of frustration, also because we are not on an equal footing,” he said. “The EU gets 15% and we get 39%. We call the US a democracy, but for me this is not democracy – there is one person who makes arbitrary decisions. It’s irrational and feels like a punishment.”\nThe immediate reaction to the tariff was a sharp reduction in orders from Gruyère’s US importers, who are also not obliged to pay a penalty. Furthermore, there are fears about the effects on the entire Gruyère supply chain, from the alpine cows that provide the milk to those who work year-round to produce the cheese.\nBut now that the decision is made, Pernet believes Gruyère makers need to let go of their anger and try to come up with dynamic solutions. “We are strong, we have a good product, and we need to find new ways to promote it, even in our local market,” he said.\nThe producers’ association, Interprofession du Gruyère, based in the town of Gruyères, is mostly charged with that task.\nThe association estimates that annual exports to the US, which currently average 4,000 tonnes, could drop by 1,000 tonnes, reducing revenue by up to 15m Swiss francs (£14m).\n“The duty is catastrophic because it has a huge impact on the prices that US consumers will have to pay,” said Olivier Isler, manager of the association. “Then there is the whole exchange rate issue.”\nThe association’s first response was to reduce production to cope with the decrease in demand and to devise new ways of promoting the product in the US in order to mitigate the effects of the higher prices. “But we also need to think about whether the US will remain a priority market for us or whether we need to evolve and focus on other markets,” said Isler.\nParmigiano reggiano’s consortium has also come up with novel ways to counter the impact, including promoting the brand by sponsoring the New York Jets American football team and creating a US-based corporation that will work with universities and retail chains on educational and training initiatives.\nParmigiano reggiano and Gruyère hail from a similar heritage, and while they are friendly rivals on the cheese competition circuit, their taste, texture and culinary uses clearly distinguish them in the market. But there is one commonality which Alai is confident will help them both maintain US custom despite the threat of cheaper, locally-made copycat versions, and that is the same thing that amazed the second world war soldiers: the all-natural recipe.\n“There are very few cheeses in the world made without additives and preservatives,” said Alai. “For some countries, this is unbelievable, but it’s the most important thing we need to make clear wherever we export.”"

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump has announced a deal with the EU to end four months of difficult negotiations between Washington and Brussels and avert a damaging transatlantic trade war, imposing a 15% import tariff on most EU goods – half the threatened rate.\nThe European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said “we have a deal” after a 40-minute meeting with Trump at his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland where the US president is on holiday for the weekend.\nShe described it as “a big deal, a huge deal” that would bring “stability” and “predictability” to both sides.. “The two biggest economies should have a good trade flow,” she said.\n“It solves a lot of stuff and was a great decision,” said Trump, describing the agreement, which also involved the EU agreeing to spend tens of billions of dollars more on US energy products, as “a powerful deal” and an “important” partnership.\n“This is this is really the biggest trading partnership in the world, so we should give it a shot,” he had said before the private meeting started.\nKeeping the EU delegation, who had flown in on Sunday for the meeting, on tenterhooks to the end, the US president had repeated less than an hour earlier that the chances of a deal were only a “50-50”, and that “three or four sticking points” remained.\nVon der Leyen said the meeting was “tough” and “very difficult”. Referring to a pre-meeting with Trump in front of the cameras, she later told reporters at Glasgow airport: “You saw the tension at the beginning. So we had to work hard to come to a common position.”\nUnder the agreement, the US will levy a 15% baseline tariff for most EU exports to the US, limiting a higher tariff. However, the rate is higher than before Trump came to power, and a 50% tariff remains on steel exports – a setback for that industry.\nThere was initial confusion over pharmaceuticals after Trump said the sector would not be included.\nSpeaking to reporters at Prestwick airport in Glasgow a short time later, von der Leyen said they were included but there were no guarantees of later increases in import duties.\n“It is agreed that we have 15% for pharmaceuticals. Whatever the decisions later on is of the president of the United States: how to deal with pharmaceuticals in general? Globally, that’s on a different sheet of paper,” she said.\nShe also revealed zero tariffs will apply to a range of other sectors including “all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generics, semiconductor equipment, certain agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials”.\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal, saying it averted a trade conflict that would have hit Germany’s export-driven economy and its large auto sector hard. German carmakers VW, Mercedes and BMW were some of the hardest hit by the 27.5% US tariff on car and parts imports now in place.\nItaly’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said it was “positive” that a trade deal had been reached but added that she needed to see the details. Italy is one of the biggest European exporters to the US, with a trade surplus of more than €40bn.\nIn a statement, Meloni said the agreement “ensures stability”.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Brussels will agree to buy, over three years, $750bn (£560bn) worth of oil, gas, nuclear fuel and semi-conductors, including liquified gas, while at the same time agreeing to invest $600bn (£446bn) in the US, a deal that includes purchases of military equipment.\nHowever, Trump retains the ability to increase the tariffs in the future if European countries do not live up to their investment commitments, a senior US administration official told reporters on Sunday evening.\nThe deal stabilises the €1.4tn trade between the EU and the US and avoids a 30% tariff rate Trump threatened to impose on 1 August if talks had collapsed.\nSpeaking on a plane back to Brussels, the EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, said Trump was “a very tough negotiator” and the “atmosphere was very intense”.\nHe conceded that 15% was a worse position for the EU than before Trump, when tariff rates were at an average of 4.8% marking a significant victory for Trump’s tariff threat tactics.\n“I think that what was most important for us was to make sure we would have this predictability and we would have stability for our businesses,” said Šefčovič.\nThe deal also creates a division on the island of Ireland as traders in Northern Ireland can sell into the US on a 10% tariff rate, setting the scene for difficult diplomatic conversations over guarantees to maintain stability on the entire island in the Good Friday agreement.\nIreland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Harris, said he “regretted” the 15% tariff rate but said “certainty” was important.\n“There is still a lot of detail on the agreement which will need to be brought forward including in relation to pharma, aviation and other sectors. Over the coming days, we will be examining what has been agreed and the full implications for Irish business and the economy, including any implications for the All-Island economy,” he said.\nThere was also confusion over the tariff rate applying to steel. While Trump indicated his punitive 50% rate would continue to apply as part of “a worldwide thing that stays the way it is, von der Leyen told reporters there would be a quota system in place.\nThe UK steel industry is still faced with 25% tariffs despite Trump’s initial promise they would be brought to zero, with hopes that there could be further concessions when Trump meets Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, in Scotland on Monday.\nThe agreement struck in Scotland is likely to be greeted with relief by financial markets when they open on Monday, after a turbulent few months with jittery investors spooked by the prospect that Trump’s tariff wars could pummel the world economy.\nTrump also signalled progress could be made in trade talks with China, with the US president saying “we’re very close”. Reports by the South China Morning Post on Sunday suggested Washington and Beijing were preparing to announce a 90-day extension to a pause in tariffs to allow for continuing negotiations, before a 12 August deadline.\nMarkets rallied sharply last week after Trump reached a trade deal with Japan, the world’s fourth-largest economy, amid investor hopes that the measures announced by Washington in the president’s 2 April “liberation day” plan could be avoided.\nFacing von der Leyen in the eponymously named DJT ballroom at his Turnberry golf resort, Trump said he was “very honoured” to have done the deal, telling the European Commission president her staff had been “fantastic”.\nThe two sides shook hands and congratulated each other in front of a bilateral delegation that included the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, and the trade representative, Jamieson Greer.\nLooking relieved and flanking von der Leyen were Šefčovič; Björn Seibert, her head of cabinet; Sabine Weyand, a key player in the Brexit negotiations and now the director general of the EU’s trade commission; and Tomas Baert, a member of von der Leyen’s cabinet who has taken a lead role in talks."

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump announced on Saturday that goods imported from both the European Union and Mexico will face a 30% US tariff rate starting 1 August, in letters posted on his social media platform, Truth Social.\nThe tariff assault on the EU came as a shock to European capitals as the European Commission and the US trade representative Jamieson Greer had spent months hammering out a deal they believed was acceptable to both sides.\nThe agreement in principle put on Trump’s table last Wednesday involved a 10% tariff, five times the pre-Trump tariff, which the bloc already described as “pain”.\nEU trade ministers will meet on Monday for a pre-arranged summit and will be under pressure from some countries to show a tough reaction by implementing €21bn ($24.6bn) in retaliatory measures, which they had paused until midnight the same day.\nIn his letter to Mexico’s leader, Trump acknowledged that the country had been helpful in stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl into the United States.\nBut, he said, the country had not done enough to stop North America from turning into a “Narco-Trafficking Playground”.\n“We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and we have concluded we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent, Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies, and Trade Barriers,” Trump wrote in the letter to the EU. “Our relationship has been, unfortunately, far from Reciprocal.”\nClaudia Sheinbaum said on Saturday she is sure an agreement can be reached before Trump’s threatened tariffs take effect on 1 August.\nSpeaking during an event in the Mexican state of Sonora, the Mexican president added that Mexico’s sovereignty is never negotiable.\nThe higher-than-expected rate has dealt a blow to the EU’s hopes of de-escalation and a trade deal and could risk a trade war with goods of low margins including Belgian chocolate, Irish butter and Italian olive oil.\nThe EU was informed of the tariff hike before Trump’s declaration on social media.\nIn a letter to the EU, Trump warned that the EU would pay a price if they retaliated: “If for any reason you decide to raise your Tariffs and retaliate, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge.”\nEuropean leaders respond\nThe European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the 30% rate would “disrupt transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic”.\nShe said the bloc was one of the more open trading places in the world, and still hoped to persuade Trump to climb down.\n“We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1. At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,” she said.\nThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, called on the bloc to “resolutely defend European interests”. Expressing Paris’s “very strong disapproval” of Trump’s announcement, Macron urged the EU to “step up the preparation of credible countermeasures by mobilising all instruments at its disposal” if the two sides failed to reach agreement by 1 August.\nGermany’s economy minister, Katherina Reiche, called on the EU to “negotiate in a pragmatic manner”, while the Federation of German Industries (BDI) warned that a trade conflict between the two partners “harms economic recovery, innovation strength, and ultimately confidence in international cooperation.”\nItaly’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, called for “goodwill … to reach a fair agreement that can strengthen the west as a whole. It would make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the Atlantic.” She added that both sides should avoid “polarisation”.\nThe decision to hike the tariffs will also be another test of Trump’s ability to act in good faith in negotiations.\nBrussels will view the latest threat as a maneuver by Trump to extract more concessions from the EU, which he once described as “nastier” than China when it came to trade.\nBernd Lange, the head of the European Parliament’s trade committee, said on Saturday that Brussels should react immediately with countermeasures against Trump’s “outrageous” threat to hike tariffs on imports from the European Union.\nThe EU had been negotiating intensively with Washington for more than three weeks and had made concessions, said Lange.\n“It is brazen and disrespectful to increase the tariffs on European goods announced on April 2 from 20% to 30%,” Lange told Reuters.\n“This is a slap in the face for the negotiations. This is no way to deal with a key trading partner.”\nWhile Trump indicated earlier this week that his new rates, also levelled against big economies including Japan, South Korea and Brazil, will not apply until 1 August, his latest tactic will create much distrust.\nEurope should make it clear that these “unfair trade practices” were unacceptable, Lange said.\n“We have postponed the first stage of our countermeasures for the time being, but I am firmly convinced that they must now be implemented immediately,” he said.\n“The first list of countermeasures must be activated on Monday as planned, and the second list should also follow quickly.”\nBrazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, downplayed the impact of the threatened 50% tariff. Trump and Lula have indicated a willingness to negotiate, though Lula also said: “Trump could’ve called, but instead posted the tariff news on his website – a complete lack of respect which is typical of his behavior towards everyone.”\nEven if Trump had agreed to the proposal put on his table on Wednesday, further negotiations would have been needed in any case to create a legal text that can be formally registered by the US government, a process that is itself laden with risk.\nThe UK took seven weeks to get its agreement registered with a promise included to reduce tariffs on car exports from 27.5% to 10%, but the agreed zero tariff for the British steel industry was omitted.\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and president of the center-right American Action Forum, said the letters were evidence that serious trade talks had not been taking place over the past three months. He stressed that nations were instead talking among themselves about how to minimize their own exposure to the US economy and Trump.\n“They’re spending time talking to each other about what the future is going to look like, and we’re left out,” Holtz-Eakin said.\nHe added that Trump was using the letters to demand attention, but, “in the end, these are letters to other countries about taxes he’s going to levy on his citizens”.\nThe new tariff ends a turbulent week for the EU with Trump announcing an extension for talks until 1 August on Monday, then on Tuesday announcing the EU would “probably” receive a letter setting its new US tariff rate within 48 hours, claiming the bloc had shifted from being “very tough” to “very nice”.\nBut diplomats viewed it as a mixed message as Trump stressed that he was still talking to negotiators from the bloc, but that he was displeased with European policies toward US tech firms."

    "raw_text": "Within hours of landing in Bangkok from Nairobi last December to start a job as a customer service agent, Duncan Okindo knew something was wrong. The 26-year-old had sold his cattle, borrowed money from friends and used his savings to pay a recruitment agency 200,000 Kenyan shillings (£1,150).\n“I felt it would be good to go outside [the country] and look for money to take care of my family,” says Okindo. “I’d tried hard to get a job in Kenya, but life here had pushed me to the wall.”\nBut when a van picked up Okindo and six other Kenyans at the airport, the driver collected their passports and told Thai officials they were tourists. After hours of driving, they were herded, tired and bemused, into a boat for a river crossing.\nThe men were being taken to neighbouring Myanmar, where Okindo found himself inside a walled compound guarded by rebel militia.\nHe was set to work every day for the next three months, forced to send thousands of messages from fake social-media profiles, posing as a rich American investor to swindle US real estate agents into cryptocurrency scams.\nWhen he failed to reach daily targets, he was beaten, locked inside a freezing-cold room and deprived of food for up to two days. He prayed he would avoid the electric shocks and sexual torture others endured at the hands of a Chinese criminal gang that ran the centre.\n“It was hell on Earth,” he says. “I broke completely, to the point of losing hope entirely.”\nOkindo, who was finally released from Myanmar’s KK Park compound in April, is among a fast-growing population of Kenyans, Ugandans and Ethiopians trafficked to south-east Asia as criminal syndicates increasingly look to expand their ranks with east African labour.\nCyberslavery compounds have proliferated in Myanmar since the 2021 coup, which upended the country’s already-fractured governance and provided new avenues for illicit activities. Along its border with Thailand, the number has increased from 11 to 26 in the past four years.\nThe UN estimates that at least 120,000 people are trapped in cyberscam compounds across Myanmar, while trafficking experts and rescue groups report that crackdowns have made little dent in the industry. The centres are run by Chinese criminal gangs, often with the complicity of Myanmar’s junta-aligned Border Guard Force.\nOkindo is one of the lucky ones. Finding and freeing trafficked people is an operation involving multiple governments, militias and police forces. The Thai authorities have facilitated the release of thousands of trafficking victims, and east African governments have been increasingly coordinating with Thai officials, who can liaise with the Myanmar military regime and militia forces across the border.\nThe victims are released into Thai custody only when their government of origin agrees to take responsibility for repatriating them, including paying for flights home.\nSince 2020, south-east Asia’s cyber-slavery industry has entrapped hundreds of thousands of people and forced them to perform “pig butchering” – the brutal term for building trust with a fraud target before scamming them. At first, the industry mostly captured Chinese and Taiwanese people, then it moved on to south-east Asians and Indians – and now Africans.\nCriminal syndicates have been shifting towards scamming victims in the US and Europe after Chinese efforts to prevent its citizens being targeted, experts told the Guardian.\nThat has led some trafficking networks to seek recruits with English-language and tech skills – including east Africans, thousands of whom are now estimated to be trapped inside south-east Asian compounds, says Benedikt Hofmann, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime’s representative for south-east Asia and the Pacific.\nAs public awareness grows in each country, it also becomes more difficult to recruit there. “It’s much more difficult these days to recruit huge numbers of people from, let’s say, India,” says Hofmann. “That’s also why we’re seeing this increase in people from Africa.”\nBetween January and April, the Kenyan government repatriated 175 citizens from Myanmar, according to Roseline Njogu, principal secretary for Kenya’s state department for diaspora affairs – a big rise on the 150 trafficked Kenyans rescued from across south-east Asia between 2022 and 2024. Hundreds more Africans have returned to other countries including Ethiopia and Uganda.\nIn Kenya, roughly 80% of people are under the age of 35 and unemployment is high. President William Ruto’s government has promoted labour export programmes as a fix, with a recent survey finding that four in 10 young Kenyans have considered migrating.\nModern slavery recruiters have capitalised on the government’s migration push, says Mutuku Nguli, chief executive officer of the Counter Human Trafficking Trust – East Africa, targeting Kenyans via online job ads, social media and in texts, or by in-person visits to rural areas.\nThe government “found themselves in the deep end of this situation”, says Nguli. Kenya’s ministry of foreign and diaspora affairs did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhile Thailand has helped thousands of people, repatriating them is expensive and challenging. After taking custody of the workers at the border, Thai officials establish that they are victims of trafficking before releasing them to their home countries, which must be prepared to coordinate and pay for their travel.\nWhen Susan Wafula* was rescued from a Myanmar romance scam centre (where fraudsters trick victims into thinking they are in love with them) in 2022, she moved between four Thai detention centres for a month as she went through legal processes to establish that she had been trafficked and eventually get a ticket home.\n“I was in a cell just so I could be determined to be a trafficking victim and get my freedom,” says Wafula, 32. “If I hadn’t, I’d have rotted away there by now.”\nNeither Uganda nor Ethiopia have embassies in Thailand, limiting their ability to locate victims in Myanmar, which is engulfed in civil war. Earlier this year, dozens of Ugandans and Ethiopians were stranded at the Myanmar-Thailand border as repatriation efforts stalled.\nScam syndicates have exploited the gaps in east Africa’s diplomatic representation to discourage victims from seeking help, says Jason Tower, of the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, claiming “their own governments don’t care about them” to make them give up hope.\n“At the end of the day, that’s what scam syndicates seek to do: turn these people into money-making machines who are able to function as high-capacity scammers,” Tower says.\nBut even as east African countries repatriate their citizens, recruitment agencies continue to advertise sham jobs. Okindo and Wafula have shown the Guardian messages from Kenyans who are still considering moving to south-east Asia.\nIn May, Okindo, who has a diploma in mass communication, sued the recruitment agency and the staff that sent him to Myanmar, accusing them of abetting in his subjection to slavery and human trafficking. A Nairobi court has issued a temporary order preventing them recruiting for work abroad.\nSince his return, Okindo has spoken about his experience on TV, TikTok and other social media platforms. He connects stranded victims with lawyers, aid organisations and ambassadors for repatriation.\nThe goal, he says, is to build awareness of predatory agencies and fake jobs, and to encourage victims to pursue justice.\n“I’ve enlightened people a lot,” he says. “Sometimes I fear talking about it, but I say whatever happens, let me save a few people instead of being quiet.”\n* Name changed to protect identity"

    "raw_text": "Five years ago, the land now home to KK Park – a vast, heavily guarded complex stretching for 210 hectares (520 acres) along the churning Moei River that forms Myanmar’s border with Thailand – was little more than empty fields.\nSet against rugged mountains south of the town of Myawaddy, KK Park, with its on-site hospital, restaurants, bank and neat lines of villas with manicured lawns, looks more like the campus of a Silicon Valley tech company than what it really is: the frontline of a multibillion-dollar criminal fraud industry fuelled by human trafficking and brutal violence.\nMyanmar, Cambodia and Laos have in recent years become havens for transnational crime syndicates running scam centres such as KK Park, which use enslaved workers to run complex online fraud and scamming schemes that generate huge profits.\nThere have been some attempts to crack down on the centres and rescue the workers, who can be subjected to torture and trapped inside. But drone images and new research shared exclusively with the Guardian reveal that the number of such centres operating along the Thai-Myanmar border has more than doubled since Myanmar’s military seized power in 2021, with construction continuing to this day.\nData from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (Aspi), a defence thinktank in Canberra, shows that the number of Myanmar scam centres on the Thai border has increased from 11 to 27, and they have expanded in size by an average of 5.5 hectares a month.\nDrone images and photographs of KK Park and other Myanmar scam centres, Tai Chang and Shwe Kokko, taken by the Guardian in August show new features and active building work.\nAt the Tai Chang complex, additional structures have emerged over the past year, including a floating dock that was built in recent months to allow supplies to be brought in more easily from Thailand. The Guardian’s drone footage also shows white squares visible on the roofs of both Tai Chang and KK Park, which are likely to be satellite internet receivers. These are to allow them to stay online after Thailand cut off cross-border supplies of electricity, internet and gas to areas hosting scam centres earlier this year in an attempt to disable them and halt the criminal gangs.\nThai authorities have previously stated that Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet service, is being used by scam compounds, and have intercepted smuggled terminals they believe to be heading across the border.\nDrone and satellite imagery seen by the Guardian of other scam centres inside Myanmar show strong fortifications and security systems. The Dongmei Park compound is surrounded by fencing and guarded by a checkpoint and perimeter watchtowers, according to analysis by Aspi.\nThe sites also feature a range of facilities for senior staff and visitors. In some compounds, luxury housing is reserved for “management teams” running the workers, or used as a setting for video calls with their intended victims, to convince them they are speaking to someone extremely wealthy, whose investment advice they should follow.\nGrim accounts of the treatment of trafficked workers trapped inside the centres have gained increased global attention in recent months, with those who have managed to escape recounting the extreme violence, torture and punishments they endured at the hands of the scam centre bosses.\nAbout 7,000 people were freed from the compounds earlier this year, through a complex rescue effort that involved neighbouring Thailand, China and other countries whose citizens were trapped, as well as the Myanmar military and armed groups that control border areas.\nBut experts say this is just a drop in the ocean. Thai police estimated earlier this year that as many as 100,000 people were held inside Myanmar scam centres along the countries’ shared border.\nThe Civil Society Network for Victim Assistance in Human Trafficking is aware of at least 90 trafficking victims currently trapped in compounds, including nationals of at least 11 countries across Asia and Africa. According to the group, some victims have lost body parts and have been blinded or permanently disabled as a result of violent abuse by crime bosses.\nMateo*, from the Philippines, spent six months trapped inside KK Park. He had travelled from his home to Thailand last year, believing he had secured a legitimate job as a customer service representative.\nInstead he was trafficked across the border and his passport was taken away. Each day he was required to message hundreds of older American men on social media sites, building their trust until they shared their WhatsApp number. The contact would then be passed on to another scamming team.\nIf he failed to meet targets he would be punished with a stun gun or with gruelling physical penalties in the searing heat outside. Leaving the compound was not an option. “There are many armed guards,” he says.\nMyanmar’s military junta has allowed the spread of scam centres inside the country as these criminal enterprises have become an essential part of the country’s conflict economy since the coup, helping it rise to the top of the global list of countries harbouring organised crime.\nAccording to Aspi’s analysis, Myanmar’s military, which has lost huge swathes of territory since the coup and is struggling to retain its grip on power, cannot take meaningful measures against the scam compounds without endangering its precarious relations with the crucial armed militias who are profiting from them.\nNathan Ruser, an open source data analyst at Aspi, says: “In many ways, this industry is now an existential necessity for the embattled Burmese military.”\nMyanmar’s military has previously said there was a need for shared responsibility to tackle the issue, including with the home countries of trafficking victims and the countries through which they transit.\nInternationally, governments mistakenly view scam centres as a relatively small human trafficking concern, says Amy Miller, south-east Asia director for Acts of Mercy International, a US evangelical organisation that works with victims of human trafficking.\n“To me, that’s such ignorance, in not understanding the scale of this and where it will grow to,” she says, adding that there are already signs of similar schemes emerging in countries such as Sri Lanka and Nigeria.\nMateo was eventually rescued from KK Park, and is now recovering with other freed workers. He is still too traumatised to reflect any more on his experiences inside the scam centres but his friend, who was trapped along with him, says of the scam bosses: “For them, money is more important than human life. They don’t care if they tread on others – what matters to them is money.”\nIt feels, he says, “like all the evil in the world” exists inside those compounds.\n* Names have been changed to protect identities"

    "raw_text": "When the advert popped up on Ly Thi Lan’s* Facebook feed, it seemed like the perfect opportunity. An employer in Cambodia was looking for new staff, the only requirement was computer skills, and the salary was generous, especially compared with her factory job in her home country, Vietnam. She would be able to save money, and pay for health treatment she needed. Her husband decided to go as well. “I just wanted to go there to have a better job, earn money to pay for a better life,” she says.\nBut when she arrived, she found it wasn’t a typical admin job. Her role was to scour the internet for victims she could trick into investing in an online scam. If she refused to do the work, she was told that she would be taken to the eighth floor of the building compound, beaten or electrocuted, she says. Lan was later told by other workers she had been sold to a criminal gang, and that they were now owned by their company. She had no idea how or when this happened, only that she couldn’t return home without paying a huge ransom.\nLan is just one of thousands of estimated victims who have been trapped in such work in Cambodia, where scam operations proliferated during the pandemic. The issue became so acute that, in August, the US downgraded Cambodia to the worst level possible in its Trafficking In Persons annual report.\nProf Vitit Muntarbhorn, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, who visited Sihanoukville, a city at the centre of such operations, likened conditions in compounds to a “living hell” in his end of mission statement.\n“We’re talking about at least thousands of cases, cumulatively, and less conservative figures could estimate even higher figures,” Vitit said of the scale of the trafficking.\nCambodia has over recent weeks begun cracking down on such establishments, raiding more than 10 condos and hotels in the capital, Phnom Penh, that were allegedly running illegal online activities, according to VOD English, which has covered the issue. It also reported that almost 1,500 foreign nationals were released during three recent raids in Sihanoukville.\nYet observers say such actions are unlikely to eradicate the problem, and that operations will probably move elsewhere. “It’s a global issue, they’re going to go to Myanmar, they’re going to go to other jurisdictions,” said Jason Tower, Myanmar country director for the United States Institute of Peace. Such criminal activities are already thriving in Myanmar, he added, which is in the midst of a deep political crisis prompted by the 2021 military coup, and where there is no effective law enforcement.\nFattening the pig\nCambodia’s Sihanoukville was once a sleepy seaside town, but over recent years it has been transformed by Chinese investment into an enclave of casinos and luxury hotels. However, during the pandemic, as tourism was halted, their business and supply of labour from China dried up.\nBuildings were adapted for new criminal enterprises, said Surachate Hakparn, assistant national police chief of Royal Thai Police. “Usually they have taken the [hotel] name plate out and built a high wall around it, and on top of the wall there is the spiked fence. Once you are in you can’t go out without permission,” he said.\nThai police managed to repatriate about 1,300 Thais between last November and March.\nSurachate travelled to Sihanoukville in June aiming to rescue more Thai citizens but was hindered by a lack of cooperation from Cambodian authorities. If policing operations are to work, he added, “all police, in every country, [need to be] on the same team”.\nIn recent comments, the prime minister, Hun Sen, appeared to take a tougher stance, saying: “Do not let Cambodia become a haven of crime, a place of money laundering, a place of human trafficking.”\nWhether the Cambodian authorities will truly change their approach remains to be seen, Surachate said.\nThe US TIP report cited “endemic corruption” as a barrier to law enforcement. Officials reportedly complicit in various forms of trafficking were not being investigated, it said.\nCambodian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\nPham Nguyen Anh Tuan was stuck in the same compound as Lan, where they were forced to carry out romance-style scams centred around a fake online shop. “We called it ‘selling emotions’,” he says. He would trawl Facebook Dating for targets. “I’d pretend to be a woman to flirt with guys. After flirting back and forth to create trust in them, I lured them into buying stuff, like a pyramid scheme. The deeper they get sucked in, the worse it’d be for them.”\nTargets would be told to buy a product, and that they would be refunded with an extra 10% of the price. Initially, for cheaper orders, the scammers would give the promised refund and people would be allowed to keep the money. “When greed and trust in each other grew, they would fall into the trap, they’d buy more stuff at a higher price, we’d ‘owe’ them, and then we’d stop paying them back.”\nIt’s a strategy known as pig butchering – building trust and fattening the target up, before enacting the scam.\nThe only way to leave the compound was by paying a huge ransom fee, which neither Tuan nor Lan could afford.\n“I didn’t want to do it, I felt so, so guilty. I did not want to do it,” says Lan of the scam work. “But if I didn’t make money for the company, the company would beat me, or send me to the eighth floor to electrocute me. Some guys in the company have been electrocuted. We saw it and got really scared.”\nLan would work between 14 and 16 hours a day, with only short toilet breaks allowed. Anyone who spent more than 10 minutes in the bathroom was told their pay would be docked. Lunch and dinner were brought to the table where staff worked.\nShe had been promised a salary of US$800-900. The first month she received only $200; by the second and third month she received nothing.\nShe was told she must earn 300 million dong ($12,653) for the company each month, and that every five days she must attract two new “customers” to be tricked into sending money. If she didn’t meet her targets her pay would be deducted and the bosses, who were Chinese, threatened her with violence.\nThe scheme at Lan and Tuan’s compound was designed to trick Vietnamese victims, but similar operations have been targeted at people across the world, from China to the US and Europe.\nJan Santiago, deputy director of the Global Anti-Scam Organization, an initiative created by victims of such scams, says it receives dozens of new cases each week. Most are based in the US, but there are many others across Asia. “I’d say that the average loss from victims in our group is about $100,000.” Victims are often highly successful professionals: accountants, lawyers and bankers. Many are targeted on dating sites.\n“The hallmark of this kind of scam is the initial scammer never really asks for money directly,” says Santiago. Instead, they’re nudging their target to invest on a third party platform. “They really make good use of the gambling psychology and loss aversion of people,” he said. “That’s where the losses really double.”\nThe opacity of cryptocurrency, combined with a lack of resources among the authorities, means agencies are rarely able to recover money.\nBreaking free\nLan managed to escape in August, when her colleagues decided they would try to break free. Their compound was in Koh Thom, Kandal province, on the border, but they feared that if they were sold to another gang, they might be moved further away to Sihanoukville, where escaping would be impossible. Tuan says he had already been sold multiple times between criminal gangs. Often, if someone is unable to meet the targets set by the bosses, they will be sold on to another operation.\nTogether, dozens of colleagues enacted a plan to escape. Some male staff fired molotov cocktails to startle their work compound’s security officers, then dozens raced from the building. Men in dark uniforms chased frantically after them, waving sticks. Lan, Tuan and others jumped into the water of the Binh Di river along the Cambodia-Vietnam border and swam for their lives, a moment that was captured on video and has since been shared widely online.\nThe water is 70 metres at its most narrow point, and Lan can barely swim. “When I was about to sink, my husband grabbed my arm to swim and took me further away from the bank.” Eventually, someone from the Vietnamese side raced over with a motorboat to rescue them.\nA 16-year-old boy did not make it, and drowned along the way. Another man, who couldn’t swim, was caught, beaten and dragged backwards, says Lan, who is now home. “The guard came down to pull him up, then hit him on the head and in the back or stomach or something with an iron stick. I saw it with my own eyes. I was terrified,” she recalls. The image of him being beaten continued to haunt her, even after her return to Vietnam.\nThe man was eventually rescued, she heard.\nThose who do manage to return home can face stigma and legal charges. In Thailand, the majority of people who have returned from such compounds, about 70%, have been prosecuted, according to Surachate.\nJacob Sims, director of International Justice Mission Cambodia, said countries need to develop strong systems to identify victims, and make sure they are supported. “Some scammers are there generally under their own volition as members of large organised crime networks. Others are experiencing confinement and extreme abuse. Many fall somewhere in the middle. Forced criminality is a complex issue,” he said.\nIt’s unclear how many more people are yet to return from Cambodia. Thailand believes about 3,000 more of its citizens remain.\nAdverts offering suspicious looking admin jobs in Cambodia, meanwhile, continue to appear online.\n“If someone approaches me now and says there’s a light job with good pay, I’ll put that person to the front page of any newspaper, report them. Because there’s no such thing as light job easy money,” Lan says. “I’ve been through it myself.”\n* Names have been changed"

    "raw_text": "About 7,000 people have been rescued from illegal call centre operations in Myanmar and were waiting to be transferred to Thailand, prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Wednesday, as the country launched a large-scale crackdown on scam centres operating on the border.\nThe prime minister’s announcement came after Thai police said they were preparing to receive up to 10,000 foreigners rescued from a network of notorious scam centres.\nMyanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have in recent years become havens for transnational crime syndicates operating online scam operations, including romance scams, bogus investments and illegal gambling.\n“It’s massive and there are thousands of people in there that have been brought in, typically through Thailand, so it’s a huge move if they clean the compounds and scams out,” said Jeremy Douglas, from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), ahead of the PM’s confirmation.\nMyanmar’s border area of Myawaddy, where foreign nationals are expected to be released, has among the largest single cluster of scam compounds in the region, and possibly the world, said Douglas.\nThe operations have become increasingly globalised, with victims from across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East tricked into enslaved work. Scams targeting east and south-east Asians resulted in financial losses between $18bn and $37bn in 2023, the UN estimates.\nAt least 120,000 people across Myanmar and another 100,000 in Cambodia may be held in situations where they are forced to execute lucrative online scams, the UN has reported. Many are lured by false promises of well-paying jobs.\nThailand has renewed efforts this year to crack down on the operations after a high profile kidnapping of a Chinese actor into Myanmar in January. The 22-year-old man, Wang Xing, was abducted after arriving in Thailand for what he believed was a casting call with film producers.\nThai authorities this month cut internet, electricity and fuel supplies to five areas in Myanmar where crime groups are known to operate.\nDouglas noted the Myanmar military’s border guard force (BGF), which controls Myawaddy, has been under immense pressure to crack down on the compounds.\n“It has reached a breakpoint recently where they [the BGF] felt they had no choice but to step in and shut down compounds,” he said.\nAbout 200 Chinese nationals are scheduled to be flown back to China on a China Southern Airlines flight on Thursday, said secretary to the defence minister General Traisak Intarassamee, as reported by the Bangkok Post.\nAbout 260 people from scam operations were deported from Myanmar last week, the Thai Army said in a statement. The group represented 20 nationalities, including 138 Ethiopians.\nRescued Malaysians said they had been electrocuted, caned and confined in a dark room when they did not meet the targets set by the scam company.\n“There were extreme beatings, lots of bruising. There were broken bones,” said Judah Tana, international director of the anti-human trafficking NGO Global Advance Projects, “It’s horrific to see them. It’s as if they have walked out of a minefield or a war zone.”"

    "raw_text": "Myanmar is a south-east Asian country that has experienced decades of conflict and repressive military rule since it gained independence from Britain in 1948. Since a military coup in 2021, fighting has flared once again. Here’s a primer on the conflict:\nWhat’s the history behind the current fighting? Myanmar spent decades under military rule from 1962 to 2011, and was a pariah state subject to severe international sanctions. However, the country gradually began to liberalise and transition to a democracy. A nominally civilian government was introduced in 2011, and historic elections took place in 2015. National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who had spent years in prison during military rule, won the vote by a landslide. The military still retained significant political power, however, and in 2021 Myanmar’s transition towards democracy was cut short when it seized power in a coup .\nWhat happened after the coup? The coup was widely opposed by the public who took to the streets nationwide in mass protests. The military responded with deadly force, and began arresting anyone suspected of criticising its rule. In response, many civilians joined so-called people’s defence forces , to fight against it. Some ethnic armed groups, which have long fought for independence, also began fighting the military. These group’s specific goals, and the extent to which they are coordinated, varies. Fighting has spiralled across much of the country, including parts of the centre, which had rarely seen conflict in previous decades.\nWho is winning and is there any likelihood of peace soon? The sheer number of groups fighting against the military has left the generals severely overstretched. It has endured the most humiliating defeats in its history, losing huge swathes of territory including along the borders with China and Bangladesh. Dozens of towns and military battalions and even two regional commands have been lost.\nA study by the BBC estimates the military controls just 21% of territory. The military has been accused of repeatedly bombing civilian sites , including schools and hospitals, torching villages, carrying out mass killings, and torturing its opponents in a desperate attempt to cling to power. Calls for the resignation of the junta chief Min Aung Hlaing have grown among pro-military circles, however he shows no signs of backing down.\nThe military has promised elections this year, but it is unclear how it will implement these given that large areas of the country are controlled by its opponents.\nWhat are the US, EU and other countries saying or doing about it? The US and EU have imposed a series of sanctions on figures and businesses linked to Myanmar’s military, however these have had little impact. The regional bloc, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has led international efforts to resolve the crisis, but with no success. It agreed upon a five-point concensus in 2021, which included a commitment to immediately end violence, and for constructive dialogue to find a peaceful solution. However, conflict has only escalated in the years since.\nWhich country has most influence over Myanmar? China. It is an ally of, and supplies weapons to, the military but it also has ties with some of the powerful ethnic armed groups located near its shared border.\nChina’s response to the coup has shifted over time . Its initial response to the coup in 2021 was muted, but Beijing grew increasingly frustrated with the military’s inability to control the country, and especially its failure to clamp down on the criminal scam centres that proliferated in border areas and which targeted Chinese citizens. In 2023 it gave implicit approval for the Brotherhood Alliance, formed of armed ethnic organisations in the north, to launch an offensive against the military, in what many analysts believe was an attempt to punish the junta. However, when these groups launched a second offensive in 2024, and succeeding in taking even more territory, China put pressure on them to stop by cutting off border supplies, apparently concerned that the military could lose control of central cities. Since then, it has been more supportive of the military.\nChina will look to protect its interests in Myanmar, said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center: “Border stability, investment, connectivity projects, and keeping Americans out.”\nWho are the Rohingya and why are they so badly affected by this conflict? The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic minority group who have lived for centuries in Myanmar. Despite this, they are not recognised as an official ethnic group and have been denied citizenship since 1982, making them the world’s largest stateless population, according to the UN. The Rohingya crisis escalated dramatically in August 2017 when, in response to small attacks by a Rohingya armed group, the military conducted deadly “clearance operations” that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya across the border to seek safety in Bangladesh. The events led to allegations of genocide in the UN’s top court .\nFor the estimated 600,000 Rohingya remaining in Myanmar the situation is especially dire. They are now caught between the military and its opponent in Rakhine state, the Arakan Army (AA), which has taken control of much of the state. Rohingya say they have been subject to forced recruitment by the junta , as well as deadly attacks by the AA, which has accused them of siding with the military.\nWhat happened to Aung San Suu Kyi? Aung San Suu Kyi delivers a speech in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, in January 2020. Photograph: Aung Shine Oo/APAung San Suu Kyi is Myanmar’s most famous politician . Born in Myanmar, which was then Burma under British rule, in 1945, she was the daughter of Myanmar’s independence hero, Gen Aung San. She went to the University of Oxford, then worked at the UN for three years, before marrying British historian Michael Aris in 1972.\nAfter moving back to Myanmar in 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi became swept up in pro-democracy demonstrations opposing the ruling junta. In 1988 she co-founded the NLD, and was placed under house arrest the following year, where she remained on-and-off for 15 years. Globally, she was hailed as an icon for peace and democracy, and was awarded the Nobel peace prize in 1991. When Myanmar eventually held elections in 2015, the NLD won a sweeping victory. Aung San Suu Kyi was prevented from becoming president by a clause in the constitution, but became state counsellor.\nInternationally her reputation suffered hugely when she failed to condemn the military’s brutal violence against the Rohingya minority. She remained highly popular domestically, however.\nShe was detained again in February 2021, after the military coup\nWhy did Myanmar change its name from Burma? In 1989 the ruling military junta changed the country’s name to Myanmar, saying “Burma” was a hangover from colonial times that favoured the majority Burmar ethnic group. At the time, pro-democracy activists opposed the change, which they said the unelected junta had no authority to make. The change was also disingenuous, given the military’s repressive treatment of minorities. Countries and media were for years divided over which name to use; Burma was associated with the pro-democracy movement, while using the name Myanmar suggested approval of the junta. Now use of Myanmar is widespread."

    "raw_text": "al-Husseina Amadou never forgets the day she was sold. Like her parents, she was born into slavery in southern Niger. Forty-five years ago, when she was 15, a wealthy businessman from across the border in Nigeria arrived and bought her from her family’s master as a “fifth wife” or wahaya.\n“My parents had no say,” she recalls. “I was just a girl and he bought me like a chicken in the market. When I left with him, I was crying with my mother.”\nFor 15 years Amadou lived with her “husband” in northern Nigeria, cooking and cleaning for his four “official” wives, whom he had married in accordance with Islamic law, and their children, while also working in their fields and tending their livestock.\nBarely fed, she would eat the family’s leftovers or steal handfuls of grain. She ran away dozens of times, returning to her family in Niger, but was always caught and brought back.\nFor these transgressions she was beaten with a stick and still carries the scars on her back.\n“If I fled or didn’t work, the wives and even the children would beat me,” Amadou says. “It was a pitiful situation. I was skinny because I was always hungry. If my husband bought food he would just give it to his wives and children. I got nothing.”\nEventually Amadou escaped by joining a caravan of camel herders that took her across the border back into Niger in a gruelling journey that took seven days on foot. There she was found by activists from Timidria, a local charity that campaigns against slavery.\n“Whenever I remember that journey, I cry,” she says. “I didn’t even have shoes.”\nSlavery has a complex legacy in Niger. It was pervasive in west African kingdoms centuries ago but despite several attempts at abolition, it remains deeply entrenched.\nThe French colonial administration outlawed slavery in 1905 and it was also banned under the 1960 constitution, when Niger gained independence. Other attempts followed in 1999 and 2003, with a penal code that formally defined and criminalised the practice.\nYet there are still tens of thousands of enslaved people across Niger, according to Anti-Slavery International and Timidria; some estimates put the number as high as 130,000. Most are descendants of people who were enslaved generations ago, living and working on the land of their ancestral “masters”, similar to serfs in Tsarist Russia.\nWahaya is one of the most prevalent forms of bondage in Niger. It is a system through which wealthy men and traditional leaders buy girls for sex and domestic work for as little as £200.\nToday wahaya is mainly practised in a southern region near the Nigerian border Timidria refers to as the “triangle of shame”. The tradition allows men who have the maximum of four wives permitted by Islamic law to take on concubines known euphemistically as “fifth wives”.\n“It is a form of sex trafficking,” says Dr Benedetta Rossi, who studies slavery in Niger at University College London. “In Islam, prostitution and sex outside of marriage are outlawed as sins, and so there is a demand for women who are available for a relationship that certain groups consider legitimate from a traditional and a religious-legal perspective.”\nThe children of women enslaved as wahaya are born with free status. “You can be a man of 70 with four wives and a wahaya, who continues to produce sons and daughters,” says Rossi. “It adds to your status. You are not just having sex, you are producing heirs.\n“You are also producing free labour because the wahaya is constantly working – she fetches water, she cleans, she cooks, she does jobs free wives cannot do because they are supposed to stay at home.”\nMen with wahaya are often well connected and police turn a blind eye to the practice, at times punishing the women who protest against their status rather than the men who enslaved them, according to Ali Bissou, the head of Timidria.\n“There was a case in 2021 when a wahaya rebelled against her husband’s official wife and the police refused to intervene; they didn’t care,” says Bissou at his office in Niamey, Niger’s capital. “We had to explain the situation to the police – that wahaya is illegal. There are even many judges who are not aware of this.”\nFounded in 1991, Timidria has offices in every region of Niger and relies on a network of volunteers to identify victims of slavery. It also visits villages, informing enslaved people of their rights and helping them bring lawsuits against their enslavers. It has set up several centres for former slaves and their children.\nThese efforts have met stiff resistance. The organisation has been accused of fraud and terrorism, and several of its staff have spent time behind bars.\n“There is very little change,” says Bissou. “Even today, if you visit the house of a chief in the ‘triangle of shame’, you will find wahayas, for sure. The best thing we can do is keep raising awareness that this is illegal.”\nHadizatou Mani is one of the former wahaya Timidria has assisted. In 1996, aged 12, she was sold for about £250 to a man in his sixties, who beat her and forced her to bear three children.\n“I was brought to my new husband’s compound at night,” says Mani. “I had to pound millet, fetch water and work on his farm during the planting season and the harvest. I didn’t have the right to say no. There was no choice but to obey.”\nShe adds: “When I was with him, he beat me often. The neighbours asked him to stop but he refused. He said he owned me and could do whatever he wanted to do.”\nIn 2005, two years after Niger’s new penal code criminalised slavery, Mani was granted a certificate of freedom and released by the man after 10 years of servitude.\nBut when she married as a free woman, her former master filed a legal complaint against her, claiming she was his wife and accusing her of bigamy.\nThe judge overseeing the case ruled in favour of the man and sentenced Mani to six months in prison. “It was incredible,” she says. “I was kept in a crowded cell like a criminal. Even the guards apologised, but they said they were doing what they had to do.”\nWith the help of Timidria and Anti-Slavery International, in 2008 Hadizatou took her case to the court of justice of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas). The court made a landmark judgment against the Nigerien state, which it ruled had broken its own anti-slavery laws and awarded Mani $20,000 compensation.\nA year later, in 2009, Hadizatou received the US state department’s International Women of Courage Award at a ceremony in Washington with Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama. In 2019, Niger’s supreme court finally overturned Mani’s bigamy conviction and directly banned wahaya.\n“I was so proud, so happy, because it meant that many women will benefit, not just me,” says Mani. “Before I didn’t have any rights; I could not say what I wanted. But since then I can work, I can help myself and other people.”\nUnlike Mani, Amadou chose not to marry as a free woman. Today she lives with five other former wahaya and their children. Together they run a co-operative, weaving straw sleeping mats and selling them at their local market.\n“We were treated like animals,” says Amadou. “Now we are free; we live like people. No one tells us what to do. We have a happy life.”\nSign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:"

    "raw_text": "By his own admission, Keir Starmer has focused intently on foreign affairs since entering No 10, mediating between Europe and the US.\nBut a year after his election, the British prime minister is standing out on the global stage for another reason: his approval rating at home is among the lowest of any western leader.\nA pan-European survey conducted at the end of August by the polling company YouGov found just 22% of British people have a favourable opinion of Starmer, in contrast with the 69% who view him unfavourably – a net rating of -47%.\nThe polling was conducted before the resignation of the former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner forced Starmer into a cabinet reshuffle.\nOnly one other European leader is more unpopular at home than Starmer: Emmanuel Macron, the embattled French president of eight years whose party lost the most recent legislative election.\nYouGov found Macron has a net favourability rating of -55% among French adults.\nThe pair’s dire ratings are significantly lower than other European leaders – the only consolation being no one enjoys a positive rating.\nGiorgia Meloni, the Italian prime minister, posted net approval of -22% after three years in the job, while the Spanish prime minister since 2018, Pedro Sánchez, sits at -31%.\nBut perhaps most galling of all to Starmer’s aides will be how his poll numbers compare with those of Donald Trump.\nYouGov’s US opinion tracker finds that, for all the chaos of his second term, Trump currently has net favourability of -12%.\nUS presidents historically have tended to enjoy higher popularity than British prime ministers, but the gulf between Trump and Starmer is particularly wide.\nStarmer’s relatively weak position compared with his western counterparts follows a decline in popularity that is unprecedented for a new prime minister in modern British politics.\nNo governing party as far back as the 1980s has seen its polling fall so far in its first year in power.\nSince the general election, Labour has dropped from polling at 37.5% in July 2024 to 23.3% in June 2025 – a fall of 14.2 points in just 11 months.\nThat is the worst for any government since 1983, when data from PollBase begins. Before this, the biggest recorded drop in popularity for a new government was in 1992, when John Major’s Conservatives fell 9.8 points in 12 months.\nThe fall has paved the way for Reform UK to take the lead in the polls, with Nigel Farage’s party now garnering the support of about 30% of British voters.\nStarmer’s government has attempted to win some of them back with tough policies on immigration and asylum, most recently with the suspension of the UK’s family reunion policy.\nBut a deeper dive into the current voting intention of previous Labour voters reveals that Starmer’s support has collapsed to the benefit of parties on the right and the left.\nAn average of polls conducted by YouGov over August shows that 14% of those who voted for Labour at the 2024 general election now intend to vote for Reform or the Conservatives.\nBut a much higher total share have been disillusioned enough with Starmer to move to other progressive parties – 13% to the Lib Dems, 10% to the Greens and 3% for the nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales.\nIt means 26% of Starmer’s 2024 coalition are defecting to the left.\nThese polls do not yet reflect the impact of Your party, the breakaway leftwing group being set up by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP Zarah Sultana.\nA survey conducted by Ipsos last month suggested as many as a fifth of Britons would consider voting for Your party, rising to a third among Labour voters – more than the current extent of leftwing defection.\nThere will be some in Starmer’s team who say this data does not mean he must change course. After all, there is a counter argument: how many more would be defecting to Reform or the Tories without overtures to the right?\nA further consideration may steel the prime minister – falling popularity while in power is inevitable, as seen in the polling histories of his counterparts.\nWhen comparing Starmer with Macron, the UK prime minister’s approval is tracking the French president’s almost exactly during his first year.\nMacron’s government suffered a sharp drop in approval after his election in 2017, amid economic discontent and the gilets jaunes protests.\nBut the French president went on to recover this lost ground by the end of his first term in 2022, amid economic recovery and the dual crises of the Covid pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\nPerhaps even more relevant to Starmer is the trajectory of the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz.\nMerz too is fighting off an ascendant far-right party, the AfD, and he too has seen a similar sharp drop in polling in his first months.\nEven Starmer’s rightwing counterparts – Trump in the US and Italy’s Giorgia Meloni – have been unable to avoid waning approval over time, though they both entered office with higher ratings than Starmer.\nAs for how Starmer might mount a recovery, there is another recent piece of polling that explains the current British mood.\nAccording to Ipsos’s most recent report on populism, published in June, Britons are now among the most likely in the west to agree that “a strong leader willing to break the rules” is needed to fix the country.\nThis may go some way to explain Farage’s recent success, given his disdain for many conventions in British politics and his commitment to exiting some international agreements.\nBut the Ipsos results also show that, elsewhere in Europe, support for a strong rule-breaker has diminished.\n“In France, the desire for such a leader has plummeted from 80% to 42% over the last decade, with similar downward trends observed in Italy and Poland,” said Simon Atkinson, the chief knowledge officer at Ipsos.\n“This could reflect a growing weariness with the disruptive nature of populist politics and a renewed appreciation for stability, particularly in countries that have experienced significant political upheaval. For Keir Starmer and wider British politics, these findings present both a challenge and an opportunity.”\nIn perhaps an attempt to better project strength, the prime minister has returned from the summer recess with a major shake-up in Downing Street which, in effect, has seen more power centralised in his office.\nIt is a gamble that may either help him reassert authority or confirm the view of voters already drifting away: that Britain’s new prime minister is not the strong leader they are looking for."

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer has said he did not get a grip on the Labour rebellion over disability benefits earlier because he was focused on foreign affairs.\nThe prime minister acknowledged he had not got it right, and said he would have wanted to make the concessions earlier. “I’d have liked to get to a better position with colleagues sooner than we did,” Starmer said in an interview with the Sunday Times. “I’m putting this as context rather than an excuse.\n“I was heavily focused on what was happening with Nato and the Middle East all weekend. From the moment I got back from the G7, I went straight into a Cobra meeting. My full attention really bore down on this on Thursday. At that point, we were able to move relatively quickly.”\nHe insisted there had been “a lot of outreach” over the bill to backbench MPs but acknowledged more should have been done. “Would I rather have been able to get to a constructive package with colleagues earlier? Yeah, I would. [But] I believe in the world we live in, not the world we want to live in,” he said.\nIt is Starmer’s third admission of having taken the wrong course in recent days, indicating he may be moving to try to reset his premiership. He gave an interview to the Observer saying he “deeply regrets” having used the phrase “island of strangers” about immigration and that he made the wrong choice in having appointed the former civil servant Sue Gray to be his chief of staff.\nStarmer will be attempting this week to draw a line under the welfare rebellion, with whips working to persuade Labour MPs to back the bill with new concessions on Tuesday.\nLiz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, offered the changes at midnight last Thursday, which would protect all existing claimants of personal independence payments (Pip) and raise the health element of universal credit in line with inflation.\nHowever, dozens of Labour MPs remain unconvinced, with No 10 facing a battle over the next 48 hours to minimise the size of the revolt.\nWes Streeting, the health secretary, said he was confident the government would win the vote on Tuesday, telling Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips that the changes “have put us in a much better position”.\n“As a result of the changes, it means anyone watching this morning who’s in receipt of personal independence payments now has the peace of mind of knowing that their situation is protected,” he said.\nOne of the original leading rebels, the former transport secretary Louise Haigh, said she would now vote in favour as long as the details confirmed the changes that were promised by Kendall. She said Starmer should now reset the government’s relationship with the public and party backbenchers.\nShe told BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme it was welcome that Starmer had “acknowledged that mistakes have been made and that things need to change”. She said: “I think this is a moment and an opportunity to reset the government’s relationship with the British public and to move forward, to adopt a different approach to our economic policy and our political strategy.\n“And I think that has been accepted from within government and a lot of people, both in the parliamentary Labour party, but crucially, the country, will really welcome that.”"

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer is battling to get a grip on the crisis that has engulfed his government, with his deputy prime minister Angela Rayner forced to step down after breaching the ministerial code over her tax arrangements.\nThe prime minister brought forward a major cabinet reshuffle in an attempt to restore order and get back on the front foot after a damaging few days, with Yvette Cooper, David Lammy and Shabana Mahmood all moved to prominent new roles.\nHowever, the fallout from the controversy over Rayner, who as housing secretary underpaid about £40,000 stamp duty on her seaside flat, is likely to further damage Labour’s already battered reputation, as it struggles to take on the challenge from Reform UK.\nWith Rayner standing down from all three of her roles – which also included deputy leader of the Labour party – Downing Street is now braced for a bruising internal party contest to replace her, which frustrated MPs could use to try to force Starmer into a change of direction.\nIt comes days after Downing Street attempted a reset after a difficult summer recess, during which Nigel Farage and migration policy dominated the headlines, and before a tough autumn during which Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is expected to raise taxes to balance the nation’s books.\nIn his ruling, the ethics watchdog Sir Laurie Magnus found that Rayner had “acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service” but concluded she had breached the ministerial code over her tax affairs.\nIn her resignation letter, Rayner said she “deeply regrets” her decision not to seek additional specialist tax advice over her purchase of the property in Hove, East Sussex, earlier this year.\nShe said she also had to consider the “significant toll” that the media pressure was taking on her family, despite her journey from “a teenage mum from a council estate in Stockport” to the highest levels of government being “the honour of my life”.\nIn his handwritten response, which he signed off “with very best wishes and real sadness”, Starmer said that Rayner would “remain a major figure in our party” and “continue to fight for the causes you care so passionately about”.\nBut her departure leaves the Labour government without one of its most authentic – and powerful – working-class voices at a time when it is struggling to reconnect with its traditional voter base and trailing Reform UK in the polls.\nAt his party conference in Birmingham, Farage said Rayner’s actions “scream of entitlement” and predicted that Labour’s deputy leadership contest could lead to a split in the party and there was “every chance” of a general election in 2027.\nIn an attempt to regain control of the chaos, and to divert attention from Rayner’s departure, Starmer held a cabinet reshuffle planned for later in the autumn, moving a dozen ministers to new roles and sacking just two more.\nYvette Cooper became the UK’s new foreign secretary, and was replaced at the home office by Shabana Mahmood, meaning that three great offices of state are, for the first time, held by women. David Lammy moved to the justice department and will also become deputy prime minister.\nMahmood, who has impressed across Westminster for her political skills and policy grip to the extent she is now regularly tipped as a future Labour leader, will now play a significant role in the government’s survival as she battles to get a grip of small boats and asylum hotels.\nThe hand of Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister’s chief of staff, was seen across the reshuffle. Labour figures suggested it was a further move to the right. With the departure of Rayner, Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, becomes one of the few cabinet members on the party’s soft left still in post.\nPat McFadden, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, is to take over from Liz Kendall at the Department for Work and Pensions with a revamped, growth-based department also taking in the skills remit formerly held by the Department for Education.\nIn what was largely a shuffling round of jobs between existing ministers, Kendall has taken over as science and technology secretary from Peter Kyle, who becomes trade secretary. He replaces Jonathan Reynolds, who becomes chief whip.\nSteve Reed, the environment secretary, has been moved to cover Rayner’s housing portfolio, a role he held in opposition. Emma Reynolds, formerly a junior Treasury minister who was out of parliament from 2019 to 2024, is promoted to the cabinet to fill Reed’s old job.\nDarren Jones, recently appointed chief secretary to the prime minister, also becomes chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, running the Cabinet Office.\nLucy Powell was sacked as Commons leader, replaced by the former chief whip Alan Campbell. Ian Murray, removed as Scottish secretary, also left government. He was replaced by Douglas Alexander, who served as a minister under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\nAs the prime minister began reshaping his cabinet team, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was confirmed as staying in place early on, as Downing Street sought to reassure the markets that the economy was in safe hands.\nWes Streeting, the health secretary, Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, John Healey, the defence secretary, and Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, were among the few ministers to stay in their posts.\nRayner had referred herself to the ethics adviser after confirming she would have to pay more stamp duty because she had incorrectly paid the lower rate on the flat in Hove.\nShe had classified the flat as her only property despite spending much of her time with her children at the family house in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.\nMonths before the Hove purchase, she had put her stake in the Ashton house into a trust set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons, who after a “deeply personal and distressing incident” as a premature baby had been left with lifelong disabilities.\nBecause her son is the beneficiary of that trust and is under 18, Rayner was still counted as having a financial interest in it for tax purposes.\nHowever, when she bought the Hove flat, she declared she did not have an interest in any other property, allowing her to pay the lower stamp-duty rate of about £30,000. The higher rate would have been an estimated £70,000.\nThough she claimed to have received written tax advice before completing her purchase, saying she was entitled to pay the lower amount, Rayner’s conveyancer said on Thursday she had not provided any such advice."

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer’s government is not in chaos, the prime minister’s new chief secretary, Darren Jones, has said following an emergency reshuffle triggered by Angela Rayner’s resignation as deputy prime minister.\nThe cabinet reshuffle, which had been planned for later in the autumn, was brought forward by Starmer in an attempt to assert control after Rayner was forced to step down from all three of her roles, having been found to have breached the ministerial code over her tax arrangements.\nAsked whether the public should see the flurry of ministerial changes as instability, just a week into the new parliamentary session and barely days after Starmer announced he had started “phase two” of his premiership, Jones told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the reshuffle was actually a show of leadership.\n“No, this is not chaos,” he said. “This reshuffle was accelerated ahead of what [Starmer] had wanted to do. That’s not chaos, that’s leadership. He acted in the moment and decided to get on with it.”\nPressed on whether the public would see the Labour government as chaotic, Jones said: “I just don’t accept the definition of chaos.\n“Of course, we would rather Angela had not been in that position, but she was, the process happened. The process happened quite quickly as well if you think about the point at which Angela referred herself to the ethics adviser, the point at which she gave the advice, and the prime minister acting within a matter of hours off the back of that advice.\n“And, as I say, the prime minister had been planning a broader reshuffle on a slower timetable, but he brought that forward because that is his decision as prime minister. That’s exhibiting leadership and control, not chaos.”\nStarmer had stood by Rayner for the entire week as questions were repeatedly raised about the underpayment of stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside flat.\nThe senior MP who earlier this week was put in charge of day-to-day delivery of the prime minister’s priorities, was also pressed on whether the reshuffle was a case of simply moving the same faces around the table rather than No 10 using the moment to inject fresh talent.\nHe defended the changes, noting that Emma Reynolds had been promoted to environment secretary. “You’re right, that we have moved people around the table, but that’s because after our first year in government we’ve been able to exhibit our strengths and skill sets.”\nYvette Cooper has been moved from the Home Office to the Foreign Office, a move that Jones rejected had been due to poor performance.\nCooper was replaced by Shabana Mahmood, meaning that three of the four great offices of state are, for the first time, held by women. David Lammy moved to the justice department and will also become deputy prime minister.\nLord Faulkner, a Labour peer and former justice secretary, said the size of the reshuffle indicated that Starmer was “aware of the fact that there is a big problem and that you need to re-engage with the public, and give an electric shock to the government, signalling to the public that there has to be change”."

It consists of 650 members, each of whom is elected by a geographical constituency of roughly equal population.\nIn each constituency, the candidate with the largest number of votes wins. There is no need to win 50% of the vote, and votes for other candidates are in effect lost. This is known as first-past-the-post voting.\nThe Commons also chooses the prime minister. By convention, the monarch invites the leader of the largest party to form a government. The prospective prime minister needs to have the support of the majority of MPs. This is possible if they lead a party with an overall majority or have the backing of other parties.\nA majority technically requires 326 MPs (half of all seats plus one), but a small number of MPs – including the speaker, his deputies and the members of Sinn Féin – do not usually vote. This means a working majority can be achieved with just under 50% of seats.\nAbout these results\nThese results are provided by the Press Association.\nBoundary review\nSince the 2019 election, there has been a boundary review, meaning this election has been fought, for the most part, in new constituencies. Therefore, for these 573 seats, the 2019 result will be taken from modelled data that shows how these new constituencies would have voted then had they existed at the time. This modelled data is sourced from research by Colin Rallings, Michael Thrasher, David Denver and Nicholas Whyte, who have modelled and amalgamated the old results to the new boundaries.\nFor the 77 constituencies that remain unchanged, the results show a straightforward comparison with the seat’s sitting party at parliament’s dissolution.\nThe total number of seats per country has changed as a result of the boundary review, to 543 in England (+10), 57 in Scotland (-2), 32 in Wales (-8) and 18 in Northern Ireland (no change).\nSitting parties\nA seat’s sitting party is the winner in the modelled 2019 election results for seats created in the boundary review, and the party on dissolution for the seats that are unchanged from 2019. This means that if a seat is unchanged from 2019 and has had a byelection, or if its MP has been suspended or changed party, that will be reflected in the “sitting party”, both for the seat and for the party totals. If there has been a boundary change and therefore the seat is new, the Press Association does not take byelections or defections into account.\nVote shares\nVote share figures are based on the modelled 2019 results for seats with boundary changes and the historical 2019 results for the seats without boundary changes.\nA seat’s vote change figures are calculated against its 2019 modelled results, unless the seat is the same as in 2019, in which case they are against the historical results.\nOther notes\nThis methodology may differ from the policies of the broadcasters, which can lead to minor differences in the seat change number for the parties, or in the “change of party” messages for individual constituencies.\nThe speaker’s seat of Chorley, if he is re-elected, will be counted towards the Labour party total.\nThe “proportional view” map is a type of cartogram, where each constituency has an equal size and weighting. This means the most densely populated areas, such as London, look very different to how they would appear on a geographical map but all seats are placed within their correct region or country.\nIllustrations by Sam Kerr"

    "raw_text": "Ministers are planning to make it harder for refugees to bring family members to the UK as part of a package of measures that Yvette Cooper will announce on Monday as she looks to get a grip on the fractious debate over irregular migration.\nThe home secretary will tell MPs she plans to make a number of changes to the way asylum cases are treated, including to the family reunion policy, which officials believe is acting as a magnet for people crossing the Channel.\nCooper’s statement to the Commons on the first day back after the recess is intended to draw a line under a difficult summer for the government, marked by public protests and legal wrangling over its use of hotels to house asylum seekers.\nThe home secretary will say: “Our action to strengthen border security, increase returns and overhaul the broken asylum system are putting much stronger foundations in place so we can fix the chaos we inherited and end costly asylum hotels.\n“That means ensuring we have the powers we need to pursue the criminal smuggling gangs profiting from small boat crossings that other parties have voted against, but also new firm rules in place to manage the asylum system so we can close hotels.”\nIn a direct rebuttal to Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, who has dominated headlines for the past week with his plan to deport almost all of those who cross the Channel in small boats, she will add: “These are complex challenges and they require sustainable and workable solutions, not fantasy promises which can’t be delivered.”\nCooper will promise to overhaul the UK’s family reunion policy, which allows people to bring their partners and children to the country once they are granted refugee status.\nThe number of people who entered on such visas has risen sharply since 2022, with just over 20,000 being granted in the year to June 2025 – a 30% rise on the previous 12 months.\nOfficials say the rise in refugee numbers is in part to blame, but they also believe the UK now has a more lax regime than many nearby countries after moves elsewhere in Europe to tighten their rules.\nIn Denmark, for example, refugees must prove financial stability before being allowed to bring over family members. Cooper is understood to be looking at similar changes, as well as setting a minimum period refugees must be settled before being allowed to invite their families.\nThe home secretary will also confirm changes to the asylum process which will remove the power of judges to hear appeals, handing them to a select panel of trained experts. Officials say this will operate in a similar way to the magistrate system, with trained members of the public hearing cases under the supervision of legal experts.\nCooper will also highlight the number of “disruptions” law enforcement officials are making to people smuggling gangs, whether through arrests, asset seizures or action to close communication networks. The government says officers took 347 such actions in 2024-25 – the highest on record.\nThey also point to an unexpected dip in small boat crossings over August to the lowest levels in four years – something they say was triggered in part by law enforcement operations to seize dinghies at the Bulgarian border over the summer.\nThis recent drop has not been enough to appease public anger, especially at the ongoing use of hotels to house those whose claims have not yet been processed.\nEssex police announced moves over the weekend to clamp down on the largest of those protests, outside the Bell hotel in Epping, after two police officers were injured on Friday. Protests must end by 8pm, while demonstrators will be stopped from blocking the road and could be ordered to remove face coverings, the force said.\nIn response to the protests, Farage announced a series of policy proposals to bar most asylum seekers from Britain.\nFarage was criticised over the weekend by Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York, who called his policy “isolationist, short-term [and] kneejerk”.\nBut he received backing in part from an unexpected quarter as Jack Straw, a former Labour home secretary, added his name to a list of experts who believe the UK can leave the European convention of human rights without undermining peace in Northern Ireland.\nDowning Street last week accused the Reform leader of not being a “serious person” for advocating the UK’s departure from the convention, which it said would damage the Good Friday agreement.\nStraw, however, on Monday gave his backing to a report from the thinktank Policy Exchange claiming this was not the case. “The debate about our future relationship with the ECHR … should be conducted on its merits,” he said.\n“This paper [from Policy Exchange] argues, in thorough and forensic detail, that ‘whatever the merits of UK withdrawal from the ECHR, nothing in the Belfast agreement rules it out as a viable course of action.’”"

    "raw_text": "There has been a familiar feeling in the air for a while, but not one I could identify until last week, when it finally settled. It is a sense that this Labour government is just as terminally dysfunctional and directionless as its predecessor. I am beginning to feel the same sense of frustration, confusion, anger and depletion that I carried through all those years of Conservative government.\nHere we are again, with the pettiness and authoritarianism, the performatively cruel rhetoric and crackdown on immigration, the ridiculous posturing on flags, the empty sloganeering – and with the constant rebooting in order to jumpstart a broken machine. The result is that government has been reduced to the same intrusive and meaningless background noise: Keir Starmer droning on about “phase two” or “delivery, delivery, delivery”. There is a sense that it’s pointless to insist that Labour can do better, be better – because it is structurally incapable of doing so.\nThe overwhelming feeling under this government is sometimes that of drift, at other times of heading at speed towards a crash. Either way, the destination seems to be Reform UK having more power than should be possible with so many grownups around. It all seems, above everything, a colossal wasted opportunity for a party that sailed in on a large majority, with an eviscerated opposition and a moment ripe for the taking.\nAt least with the Tories it was clear why governance had become an empty exercise in buying time. The party was spent, Brexit had run out of steam, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had burned through public goodwill during Covid and economic uncertainty, and Rishi Sunak was tragically unsuited to turn it all around, even if that were possible. But what’s Labour’s excuse? Westminster is preoccupied with policy announcements, conferences, budgets, resignations and reshuffles amid personal scandal, but zoom out and what hoves into view is that the UK’s political system is imploding.\nI find myself reluctantly pulled into the psychodrama. Both gripped and repulsed, I have watched Starmer’s bizarre and robotic pronouncements, former home secretary and now foreign secretary Yvette Cooper’s chirpy updates on forced removals and the newly minted deputy prime minister David Lammy not doing much at all. What timing, that just as the world was plunged into insecurity and conflict, the foreign secretary was a man who only spoke in platitudes about “progressive realism”. I look forward to him being loudly pointless in his new role.\nCollectively, these people constitute a government that is absent when required and violently invasive when not. A summer of anti-migrant protests and rising nativism is met with statements about closing asylum hotels and the importance of the flag, offering little to assuage the fears of those frightened and unsettled by the new mood. In contrast, the government mobilises to ban Palestine Action and arrest hundreds of peaceful protesters.\nThere is something hardwired within this government that shapes its character. It is unreactive and leaden, unless it’s showing force to prove itself to a set of voters, privileged above all others, that Labour is hard enough – even though all the signs point to the fact that all that is achieving is more alienation. This party was fashioned in a fight against the left and its need to represent itself as “under new management”. It is defined by its distaste for its progressive wing’s history and legacy and is constantly purging its ranks and affiliations. Following the departure of Angela Rayner, a load bearer for the party’s left-leaning and working-class constituency, the cabinet reshuffle has nudged the party further rightward. Labour’s pathological insecurity that voters and the press do not buy that its leaders are sensible, grownup moderates has cannibalised the party, turning it into an organ that is driven by how it looks and sounds rather than what it wants to achieve.\nYet for all its bluster, Labour’s posture and messaging ring hollow. Austerity, closed borders and security overreach are key expressions of rightwing ideology. When Labour promotes such ideas, it feels inauthentic: the product of triangulation and focus groups. It is a chronically defensive way of going about politics that misses the instinct and spirit needed to inspire trust and passion in voters. The outcome is that it has turned into a party with no natural constituency, appealing to those who will always be more at home in parties further to the right, and telling off its own voters. The end result is that same mean, scolding negativity of the Tories in their later years.\nAt the centre of it all is the sinkhole that is Keir Starmer. The simple explanation for why he is how he is, is that he is simply unsuited to office and in over his head: a man who approaches politics on the basis of what he feels he needs to say in the moment, rather than out of belief or mission. Some of you may know him from the office: a careerist who will look you dead in the eye and tell you, the moment it becomes more convenient to take a different line, that isn’t what he said at all.\nBut maybe the more complex reasoning for why Starmer is such a vacant leader is that only such a man could have been elected as prime minister. Only a man characterised by the ability to identify who he must ingratiate himself with could have won the electoral race, placated powerful business interests and fended off the rightwing press. It’s a political skill that could be put to good use in power if he just knew what he wanted to do with it. It turns out “ruthlessness” alone, a quality often commended when Starmer was an aspiring prime minister, is a turn-off in post, when leaders must inspire and lead as well as govern.\nAnd so it makes sense that a party built on a lack of conviction and disdain for progressive values, and driven by entitled ambition, should be exposed so quickly. There’s something triggeringly familiar about how we have ended up exactly here again, even though all the red flags were there. It is, above all, a sad reprise for a nation that constantly gets worse than it hoped for. But here we are. We go again.\n-\nNesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer has attempted to wrest back control of economic policy from the Treasury by bolstering his No 10 team, bringing in the chancellor’s deputy and a former Bank of England chief to senior roles.\nBefore what is likely to be a tumultuous autumn for the government, he created two new roles with Darren Jones put in charge of day-to-day delivery and Minouche Shafik appointed the prime minister’s chief economic adviser.\nDowning Street sources said the changes showed Starmer recognised his operation needed more economic heft to challenge Treasury thinking and avoid damaging pitfalls such as those over winter fuel payments and welfare cuts.\nAs MPs returned to Westminster after a difficult summer, during which Reform UK dominated the news agenda and soared ahead in the polls, Starmer wants to get on the front foot on issues including the economy and migration.\nHis internal No 10 reshuffle, which also covered the communications team and the policy unit, comes alongside a new economic pledge to deliver growth that “people can feel in their pockets”, a nod to the millions who are still struggling with the cost of living.\nThe extent of the shake-up reflects the sense that Starmer’s No 10 has increasingly struggled to impose its own narrative, and is instead mainly being shaken by external crises, notably the focus over the summer on migration, and Reform UK’s planned response to it.\nThings are unlikely to improve in the short term, with the return of parliament presenting the prime minister and his team with a series of tough challenges, including the likely need for tax rises in this autumn’s budget.\nStarmer rejected the idea the changes were prompted by crisis, arguing it was more a case of a new phase of government. “This should be seen more as moving on to the second phase than a reshuffle, because some of the positions are actually new positions,” he told the BBC.\nDowning Street insiders acknowledged the changes were designed to give Starmer greater control over Whitehall, including of the Treasury, with No 10 evolving into a “command and control” operation.\n“There have been things we should have seen coming where the chain of command and oversight were not what we wanted. This is Keir saying he wants to have a direct line of sight to everything. Darren knows the departments inside out because of the spending review,” one said.\n“Keir has been thinking about how to fix things for the last couple of months and these are his appointments and this is his structure. There are decisions that were made in the Treasury – winter fuel being one of them – where No 10 did not take enough oversight.”\nAnother senior No 10 source said: “These are not people who have been appointed to be at odds with the Treasury or alternative power bases but to work with it. The economic agenda has to be aligned. But of course the PM needs to be able to shape it. Downing Street has to be able to challenge.”\nA senior government insider denied the changes risked undermining Reeves’s position, saying she had been involved in discussions on them since earlier in the summer. “That is an analysis based on prime ministers and chancellors of the past – Blair and Brown, May and Hammond – when in fact these appointments make the Treasury’s job easier,” they said.\nJones, whose new title will be chief secretary to the prime minster, will be replaced as Rachel Reeves’s deputy by James Murray, who has been promoted from exchequer secretary. In turn, his role will be taken by Dan Tomlinson, the government’s “growth mission champion”, as Starmer seeks to reward the new 2024 intake.\nHowever, there is not expected to be a wider reshuffle of the junior ministerial ranks this week, senior sources said, and cabinet ministers will stay in their current roles.\nThe communications operation will also be shaken up with Tim Allan, an adviser to Tony Blair in No 10 who went on to fund the PR firm Portland, coming in as executive director of government communications.\nHis appointment has caused some alarm in government, as he did some work for Russian president Vladimir Putin in the early noughties to reshape his own image in the eyes of the west ahead of hosting the G8 summit that year. “I can’t wait for the Tories to start looking at Portland’s lobbying for the Russian government,” one Labour source said.\nThe political role is separate from that of David Dinsmore, a former editor of the Sun who has been tasked with improving the civil service communications operation. There have been questions internally over whether either man is up to speed with the modern media landscape.\nJames Lyons, Downing Street’s director of communications for strategy, is stepping down. Steph Driver, his counterpart for day-to-day No 10 communications, who is close to Starmer, stays in post, answering to Allan. Joe Dancey, the Labour party’s director of policy and communications, and partner of the health secretary Wes Streeting, has also left his role.\nThe No 10 policy unit is also undergoing changes, after some internal conflict over who was running the department. Liz Lloyd, who was Tony Blair’s deputy chief of staff at No 10, is leaving but is expected to move to a new role in government.\nStuart Ingham, another policy chief and Starmer’s most longstanding aide, will leave the unit to work in chief of staff Morgan McSweeney’s team, taking on a more political role, which sources said would ensure the prime minister’s priorities were taken into account in every decision.\nA new political policy chief is expected to be appointed shortly, but in the meantime Vidhya Alakeson, one of McSweeney’s deputies, will oversee day-to-day policy work.\nHowever, there was some concern among Labour MPs that the changes may not fix fundamental problems at the top of government. The latest appointments mean that since Starmer became Labour leader, he has had four chiefs of staff and five directors of communications.\nOne Labour backbencher said: “Overall I think it is not something you can staff your way out of. This is about the politics and the story we tell. All the comms and strategy people in the world won’t fix that.”\nA senior Labour source added: “It’s not just a question of narrative. It’s ‘what is our purpose and how do we use power?’ The stakes are a shift to radical right authoritarian government. As progressives that’s an emergency.”\nIn his BBC interview, Starmer said while he understood people’s concerns about migration, Reform and Nigel Farage were exploiting the issue. “They feed on grievance. They don’t want the problem solved because they’ve got no reason to exist if the problems are solved,” he said.\nWhen asked about a recent spate of English flags being draped on lamp-posts or spray-painted on roundabouts, the prime minister said he was proud of the flag, and had one in his Downing Street flat, but was wary of it being used for “divisive” reasons.\nMujtaba Rahman, of political analysts Eurasia Group, said: “Keir Starmer’s reshuffle of his Downing Street team reflects his frustration at what he sees as a bloated but slow civil service machine and a desire to bolster No 10’s heft on the economy.\n“That is a belated recognition that Starmer delegated too much power to Rachel Reeves, whose political judgment was lacking on means-testing the pensioners’ winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts – both later abandoned.”"

    "raw_text": "In the mid-90s, Bonnie and Terry Turner created a TV sitcom about a group of aliens (led by John Lithgow as their self-regarding High Commander) on a research mission to Earth. As they attempted to integrate into human life by posing as an ordinary family, gentle, charming hilarity ensued for six seasons – an unexpectedly long time, and 3rd Rock from the Sun became known as “the show they couldn’t cancel”. The fondness everyone felt for it endured past the show’s technical peak and kept it on our screens until the commercial inviability became too stark and/or the actors’ interest in participating waned. It was a rare pocket of sentimentality in the otherwise ruthless world of television programming.\nOnly Murders in the Building is in all respects a much better show than 3rd Rock. It manages to fold in a cosy whodunnit, social media satire, zippy one-liners, sight gags, physical comedy and intergenerational friendships and commentary. An undertow of melancholy is ameliorated by optimism as its trio of main characters bond over their love of true-crime podcasts, then start their own, forging connections with the assorted misfits in the apartment building they live in, and the wider world. But as the fifth season begins, the memory of 3rd Rock begins to come back to me more strongly.\nBecause I am one of the many devoted fans of OMITB, and we never want it to die. There are many reasons to love it: the wit, the intelligence, Steve Martin (who co-created it with John Hoffman) as closed off Charles Haden-Savage gradually letting his guard down with his unsought new friends, Martin Short as irrepressible theatre director Oliver Putnam – and Selena Gomez in one of the greatest indefinably weird performances ever committed to non-celluloid. There is also the glamour of the Arconia building, and the fact that the role of manic pixie dream girl went to Short and not Gomez. But we love it beyond all those.\nHowever … season three experienced a little slump, as a couple of guest stars (Paul Rudd and Meryl Streep) landed larger parts, rather than the entertaining cameos previously provided to the likes of Sting and Amy Schumer, and the action moved partly out of the Arconia and on to Broadway, upsetting the delicate balance on which OMITB had thrived. The re-anchoring around Sazz’s death and Charles’s grief in season four, despite the trips and flashbacks to Hollywood sets, got us mostly back on track, and it just about contained the sprawling cast and plotlines occasioned by the Only Murders podcast becoming a film, giving us the rarely seen play-within-a-play-within-a-play device.\nNow, with season five, the centre is failing to hold. We ended the previous season in the traditional manner, with our heroes finding another murder in the building (or at least its grounds): this time of Lester the doorman (Teddy Coluca). Then we have another. Then the clues (including a missing finger, a mafia connection and an elevator crank) and suspects (including Téa Leoni as an Italian widow and potential love interest for Charles, who is taking testosterone supplements for his health; three billionaires; and Lester’s wife, Lorraine – Dianne Wiest, her brilliance eternal) begin to arrive. But they feel randomly scattered rather than meaningfully laid. The podcast element falls by the wayside, the proportion of red herrings to genuine progress is off, the action is too often located outside the Arconia, and the core team are too often split up – not least by the return of Streep as Oliver’s now-wife, Loretta. I know that I am probably in a minority in feeling that: a) a little of Streep goes a long way; and b) she should, wherever possible, be kept away from comedy.\nToo many moments feel laboured where once they would have been nimble and fleet. Howard’s (Michael Cyril Creighton) relationship with the new robot-doorman is absurd in the wrong way, Renée Zellweger as one of the billionaires is just a collection of mannerisms (though Christoph Waltz as another is just what classic OMITB would have ordered and a joy to watch). And Oliver’s snort, which had fallen into welcome abeyance when it became clear that the show was working brilliantly without such gimmicks, is back.\nIt is still charming, still fun. It still has enough flashes of the old dynamic to keep us hooked and hopeful. Martin, Short and Gomez have not lost sight of their characters, and a course correction could easily be made for season six. To end it here would be a disservice to all."

    "raw_text": "Butterfly numbers have bounced back after the dismal summer of 2024, but the hottest summer on record delivered only an average number of the insects in the annual Big Butterfly Count.\nMore than 125,000 citizen scientists joined the biggest insect survey in the world this summer, counting an average of 10.3 butterflies in each 15-minute count in parks, gardens and green spaces across Britain.\nThis was a marked improvement on 2024, when a record low of just seven butterflies per count were recorded. The most-seen butterfly, the large white, enjoyed a 131% increase in sightings on last year, with similarly large increases for the small white (up 128%) and red admiral (up 185%).\nBut Butterfly Conservation cautioned that the numbers have simply returned to average levels and that there were more butterflies per count in 2023 and every summer from 2016 to 2020.\nDr Richard Fox, the head of science at Butterfly Conservation, said: “We may feel like we’ve seen lots of butterflies this summer, but that’s only because last year was so awful. The 15-year Big Butterfly Count trends show that more than twice as many widespread species have declined significantly than have increased. And while most species had a better-than-average summer, one-third of species fared poorly even in the generally beneficial weather.”\nThe large and small white enjoyed their best-ever Big Butterfly Count results, and the day-flying Jersey tiger moth was recorded more widely and in higher numbers than ever before. On the down side, the holly blue had its second-worst Big Butterfly Count result, and the usually abundant meadow brown its fourth-worst result, although that may have been because it was on the wing much earlier than usual and had largely finished flying when the count began on 18 July.\nThe small tortoiseshell bounced back from its worst-ever Big Butterfly Count result in 2024, but this once-ubiquitous garden butterfly has still declined by 60% since 2011. Over that 15-year period there are some winners, with significant long-term rises for the large white, red admiral and small copper.\nFox said: “There remains a need for us to take urgent action to support our butterfly populations, including by improving the environment in which they live, restoring habitats and reducing pesticide use. Until we do these things we are unlikely to see a great recovery in butterfly numbers, regardless of how much the sun shines.”"

    "raw_text": "Do you feel it? There is a ripple in the firmament, a vibration in the foundations, a bracing of the cosmos … yes, Mark Ruffalo is preparing to Act again. This time, he stars in crime drama Task, created by Mare of Easttown’s Brad Inglesby, as a former priest turned FBI agent nursing a great sorrow in the suitably grey environs of suburban Philadelphia. Tom Brandis ends every day in a drunken semi-stupor and begins every morning with prayer and a head-dunk into an ice-filled sink. Do you think we might be in for a meditation on guilt, sin and the possibility of redemption? Yes, I wearily agree.\nSo. Brandis is taken off the desk duties he has been assigned since his great sorrow. This is evidently connected to the sentencing hearing for a third-degree murder conviction he is due to attend next week, where his daughter Emily may be giving a family impact statement – but we will have to wait just long enough for it to feel outright manipulative before we get the full explanation of who killed who and how. Brandis is assigned to a new taskforce to investigate a series of armed break-ins at drug houses owned by the Dark Hearts biker gang, in the hope that arrests can be made before Philly is consumed by a turf war. He has three youngsters to help him: the charmingly arrogant, Catholic-raised Anthony (Fabien Frankel); the supremely competent Aleah (Thuso Mbedu); and the supremely incompetent Lizzie (Alison Oliver). Their single characteristics allow Brandis to prove his priestly credentials (God-talks with the lapsed Anthony), his generosity of spirit (this middle-aged man is not threatened by youthful ability!) and patience (I would return her to Quantico instantly, bearing a large label that read “Not fit for purpose”) and not much else.\nThe raids are being conducted by garbagemen and best friends Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) and Cliff (Raúl Castillo), who can tell from the trash cans on their route which dealers’ houses have recently disposed of drugs and filled up with cash. How they know which are Dark Hearts facilities and why they are specialising in those will again become clear in the fullness of time. They are accompanied on the raids by younger friend Peaches (Owen Teague), who you might suspect is marked for death the moment he expresses his joy at the fact that he has just become engaged. I couldn’t possibly comment.\nApropos nothing, Task ticks all the expected boxes. There are bloody shootouts, corpses and bags full of fentanyl instead of cash grabbed in chaotic getaways which will then require selling. Which requires finding a buyer. Which requires becoming further enmeshed in the drugs world – and more identifiable to those seeking to destroy you for killing their men and taking their 12 kilos of fentanyl in the first place. Especially as you also kidnapped a child witness in the process.\nNow, Mare of Easttown was no picnic. But it had plenty of black humour and was full of vividly drawn, wholly believable family relationships and friendships that gave it a sense of life in the round. The criminality mattered because it affected people in all walks of life. Task, by contrast, is relentlessly bleak, humourless and narratively airless. It is not just the Brandis family that is crushed by terrible griefs and burdens. Robbie’s wife has left him and he is mourning the death of his brother Billy. His niece Maeve (Emilia Jones), Billy’s daughter, is dying by inches under the strain of looking after Robbie’s motherless children, which does not seem a fair trade for letting him move in with her after her father’s death left her with a house.\nIt flattens the characters into ciphers, deadens the story and as time goes on, makes the whole thing inescapably boring. It is not as if we haven’t seen everything on show before. Let’s find another way to propel a plot – or maybe even find another plot entirely – especially in Philadelphia.\nBut if formulaic yet weighty stuff is your bag, if gestures towards bigger issues rather than actual interrogations of them are all you’re up to at the moment, then a relatively enjoyable Task lies before you. For anything else, you can always rewatch Mare of Easttown."

No, Mark Zuckerberg is a well-regarded bankruptcy lawyer from Indianapolis.\nOh no, have we fallen into a parallel universe again? Do try to keep up. There can be more than one person with the same name in the world.\nGot it. Mark Zuckerberg (the Indianapolis bankruptcy lawyer) is fed up with Facebook (the borderline unusable social media platform founded by the other Mark Zuckerberg). There, that wasn’t so hard.\nBut why? Why do you think? Imagine having a Facebook account, and also having the name Mark Zuckerberg. You’d spend your whole life being flooded with messages and requests and abuse.\nThat makes sense. Also, Indianapolis Zuckerberg spent thousands of dollars on Facebook to advertise his legal firm, but Meta kept deactivating his account after assuming he was impersonating a celebrity. So now he’s suing Meta.\nI always feel sorry for people who share names with celebrities. Me too. Remember the poor mild-mannered Virginian man John Lewis who, thanks to the fact that he owns the @johnlewis handle on X, spends weeks of his life calmly but firmly explaining to strangers that he is a person and not a large chain of UK department stores?\nWhat a nightmare. Then there’s the late children’s author Jeremy Strong, who had the stranglehold on his name for years until the TV series Succession came along. He spent his latter years apologising to strangers for not being the actor who played Kendall Roy.\nWell that’s just bad luck on his part. Bad luck for lawyer Zuckerberg, too. Prior to the lawsuit he had been keeping track of everything that has happened to him since the younger Mark Zuckerberg came to prominence.\nOh really, like what? He has been mistakenly sued by the state of Washington while companies refuse to take his business for fear that he’s pranking them. He’s spoken about seeing disappointment on the faces of limo drivers sent to pick him up. And when he signed up for 23andme, he was inundated with people who a) claimed to be related to him and b) asked for money.\nWhat a nightmare. Anyway, Meta has decided to reinstate Mark Zuckerberg’s account, and has apologised for the confusion, but the lawsuit stands to go ahead nonetheless.\nWell good luck to him. And there’s precedent here too. In 2019, the designer Katie Perry sued the singer Katy Perry for trademark infringement. Unfortunately for Indianapolis Zuckerberg, the singer won on appeal and Katie Perry was forced to deregister her trademark.\nBad time to be called Katie Perry. Or Mark Zuckerberg.\nDo say: “It’s hard being named after someone famous.”\nDon’t say: “As my newborn son Donald Trump will soon discover.”"

    "raw_text": "I was born in the wrong century – or so my mother says, while I protest from my writing bureau, wax seal in hand, ready to dispatch an Austen-style letter to a friend. But as I put out the candle flame with my antique snuffer, I wonder if she might be right. For me, the past has always felt like home – I grew up on a literary diet of classic fiction, seasoned with a love of my Regency hero, Jane Austen.\nSo when the BBC dramatisation of her most popular novel, Pride and Prejudice, first aired in 1995, it was manna from heaven for me, especially as an A-level English literature student. My pre-binge-era classmates and I delighted in the weekly suspense. We chattered of Mr Darcy’s intense looks, so sizzling they could fry an egg; laughed over the unfiltered comments of a dramatic Mrs Bennet; hummed that glorious title music on repeat. It played in my head whenever I sauntered around the open fields of my local Kent countryside. I felt like – nay – I was Elizabeth Bennet.\nThere was nothing quite like this cultural offering back then. American dramas tended to dominate: My So-Called Life, Friends, The X-Files. I dipped in and out, but the BBC’s Pride and Prejudice dug deeper. With its sparkling cast, sharp direction, comic precision and seamless production, it not only breathed spirited life into one of my favourite books of all time, it electrified it. The new adaptation spoke to my old soul sensibilities.\nI was not alone in my euphoria. The mid-90s BBC adaptation has become something of a cultural touchstone. It features in Greta Gerwig’s 2023 Barbie movie, when a depressed Barbie binge-watches the series seven times. Lena Dunham’s recent Netflix series Too Much, whose main character moves to London, is also enamoured with the adaptation.\nThere is even a Facebook fan page solely devoted to the 1995 series. It was created by 29-year-old bartender Shelby Elise, whose tattoos include a quote from the novel that runs across her collarbone: “She only smiles, I laugh”.\nElise, from Kansas, set up the fan group during the Covid pandemic as a “safe haven”. Within 24 hours, it attracted 300 members; today, that figure is nearing 10,000. She says: “My moderators are all around the world – Greece, Germany, Portugal, the US. It’s definitely brought in friendships for me. Our love of the series has built a solidarity.”\nFor one moderator, Persefoni, based in Greece, the series not only connected her to a global fan network but directed the course of her career. “It had such a tremendous impact that I decided to become an English teacher and try to immerse Greek students into the Jane Austen universe. It was a decision I have never regretted! The series will forever hold a very special place in my heart.”\nModern-day pilgrimages are also popular with Pride and Prejudice devotees, and Adge Secker is something of a seasoned guide on the sacred Austen trail. A retired police officer based in Bath, he has been running a successful tour business for several years. “I love rugby, cider and Jane Austen,” he says in a cheerful Somerset accent.\nThe BBC classic inspired him to create the Carriages to Meryton tour, taking fans to locations made famous by the TV drama – such as the Red Lion pub in the village of Lacock, Wiltshire, used as the ballroom where Elizabeth meets Darcy for the first time; and the Bennets’ fictional family home, AKA Luckington Court in Wiltshire; and the nearby medieval church, which served as the scene for the double wedding. Adge tells me he is always fully booked, almost entirely thanks to US clients.\nBath’s immersive Regency Balls are annual events that recreate early 19th-century public dances, with punters turning up in full costume. I went to one 16 years ago, having stitched a gown skirt to a hand-tailored top to create a DIY Regency empire line, and tied a blue ribbon around my hijab in an attempt to feel less out of place. As a Muslim of Indian heritage, I was apprehensive that I wouldn’t quite fit with the majority white, mock-period English setting. However, barely an eyelid was batted: we were all united as Austenites. More recently, the Jane Austen festival team say they have “noticed a particular upswing of diversity” as Pride and Prejudice continues to draw international audiences.\nIn fact, Austen’s world of family honour, chaperones and matrimonial pressures always resonated with my traditional Asian Muslim paradigm – as it did for the British Pakistani author Ayisha Malik. The BBC adaptation influenced Malik’s first novel, Sofia Khan Is Not Obliged, which was pitched as the Muslim Bridget Jones by Malik, and marketed as such. Of course, Bridget Jones’s Diary itself owes a great deal to Pride and Prejudice – the novel and the BBC series. Author Helen Fielding admitted she “stole” the plot from Jane Austen and that, while writing Bridget Jones’s first incarnation in a newspaper column for the Independent 30 years ago, she was “infatuated” with the BBC drama that was airing the same year. From this, she developed the idea for the book.\nWhile the Bridget Jones franchise has been criticised for its lack of diversity, Malik made sure her protagonist leaned in to her difference. “She’s navigating all the same things that any other woman might in contemporary dating, except she wears a hijab, doesn’t drink. She is also family-oriented, doesn’t have sex before marriage and, if she doesn’t marry a rich man, her mother will possibly implode – a bit like Elizabeth Bennet,” she says. “I remember going on a date where I had a chaperone and I was like, wait, am I in an Austen novel?”\nDamianne Scott, a professor at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, US, is also on a mission to bring about more diversity to the Janeite fandom. Scott founded her Facebook and Instagram handle, This Black Girl Loves Jane, in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, creating a space where fans of colour could see themselves in Austen’s world. In 2021 she joined the Jane Austen Society of North America – the world’s largest literary society devoted to Austen – and presented a panel at their AGM titled Do You Dream of Austen in Color?\nScott was 19 when the BBC drama first aired, and believes its strength lies in its humanity. “We all have these families,” she says. “Black families have a mother or aunt like Mrs Bennet who’s a little crazy and trying to get you married. We all know a sister or friend who is like Jane. We all have what we term in the African American community ‘the fast one’, which is Lydia – trying to be adult when you’re really only a kid; we all know a bad boy like Wickham. You can find yourself with one of those sisters, and you can find your aunts, uncles, moms and dads in the Bennets – whatever your colour, race, ethnicity or age – they are all portrayed so well, and that’s why I’m a 1995 girl.”\nIt’s these recognisable quirks and family dynamics that have given the series its staying power – from Lydia’s irrepressible eye-rolls to Mr Collins’ embarrassing dancing at the Netherfield ball. These are the moments that lift the series beyond the script – capturing not just Austen’s wit, but the very essence and messiness of being human.\nThe writer, comedian, podcaster and improv actor Cariad Lloyd revealed her love affair with Pride and Prejudice at a OneTrackMinds event last year, where speakers shared the music track that defined a moment in their lives. While others opted for adrenaline-charged tracks such as the Prodigy’s Firestarter or Foo Fighters’ The Best of You, Lloyd chose the charming title theme to the BBC’s Pride and Prejudice. “It was love, just absolute pure love,” sighs Lloyd. She was 13 when she first watched the series with her parents, describing it as an “out-of-body experience”.\nIt was Lloyd’s first brush with Austen – she had never read the book – and she was bereft when the series ended. It also led to her love of improvisation. “I would just talk to myself as if I were in Pride and Prejudice. I was ‘Cariad Bennet’, the Bennet sister they forgot. I would go to my room and pretend to be all the characters for hours and hours.”\nLloyd has since turned her childhood passion into a career: she is one of the eight-strong cast of Austentatious, a brilliantly chaotic stage show that fuses improvised comedy with the world of Jane Austen. The award-winning production is now in its 14th year, with a residency in the West End and a national tour under way.\nThe BBC dramatisation, Lloyd says, changed her life. “My 13-year-old self was right – it’s still the best thing I’ve ever seen. The dialogue, the clothes, the characters, the romance – there wasn’t a single thing I didn’t love. And to think we were watching live chemistry as Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle actually got together during the filming. What could be more exciting than that?”\nThe tantalising attraction was perhaps key to the drama’s enduring success. Many a pulse was raised when Firth rose from the murky lake, making TV history with the wet shirt scene, despite screenwriter Andrew Davies claiming he never intended it to be sexy, and that it was “a puzzle and a surprise” when Firth became a pinup. The shirt set off a ripple effect of soaked tributes, from Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy to Bridgerton. Darcy’s shirt even fetched a tidy £25,000 at auction with proceeds going to charity.\n“People still think the wet shirt scene is in the novel,” says Prof Janet Todd, an academic, author and Austen expert. I first met Todd chairing a panel tantalisingly titled Disrobing Mr Darcy at the Bradford literature festival in 2017. She admits she used to be a bit “priggish” about classic novel adaptations, but describes the 1995 outing as “a piece of art in its own right, independent of the original book”. Firth, she says, made Darcy a bit like “a brooding Romantic hero”. “He hardly smiles, unlike Darcy in the book, and he looks moody: this hit the spot at the time, hence Darcymania.”\nTodd edited The Cambridge Companion to Pride and Prejudice in 2013, as well as penning her own tribute in this anniversary year, Living with Jane Austen. “Following the BBC drama, I was asked to teach entire classes solely on the works of Austen in the universities of East Anglia, Glasgow and Aberdeen, which I’d never done before,” she says. “I had always taught her alongside other early 19th-century male authors, but not on her own.”\nFrom seminar rooms to spoofs and spin-offs such as Austenland, Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and the Bollywood-themed Bride and Prejudice, the BBC series certainly left its mark. And there is another to anticipate: Netflix is planning a new take on the Austen classic, a six-part series starring Olivia Colman as Mrs Bennet and Emma Corrin and Jack Lowden as the leading couple, set for release in late 2026.\nI look forward to it – yet my favourite iteration thus far is not a lavish multimillion-dollar interpretation but rather the self-filmed Budget Pride and Prejudice by the actor and writer Ben Fensome. His outrageously funny 65-part video series went viral on TikTok last year, piling up hundreds of thousands of views, and racking up more than 3m likes for his page. Shot on a shoestring at his parents’ house in Devon, the series sees Fensome lip-syncing dialogue from every character in the 1995 series. Highlights include Wickham astride an exercise bike standing in for a horse, Darcy sporting socks stuffed into his collar in place of a neckerchief, Mrs Bennet with a doily in place of a Regency lace cap and Lady Catherine de Bourgh in a voluminous lampshade for a hat.\nFensome grew up with the drama – he was nine when it first aired – and was close to breaking his VHS cassette by the time he knew many of the scenes by heart. Almost three decades later, Budget Pride and Prejudice has catapulted his own acting career. “For years, I was struggling,” he says. “It’s definitely opened loads of doors.” Fensome’s viral hit earned him his first time narrating an audiobook, Mr Bingley: Just as a Gentleman Ought to Be, by Brandon Dragan, as well as landing him a part (two parts, really – he plays Wickham and Mr Collins) in a new multi-theatre production play of Pride and Prejudice, touring the UK until the end of October.\nTo me, the drama has always felt close and personal. Mrs Bennet is just like an aunt I know whose sole concern was to get her daughters married; Mr Collins reminds me of a cringeworthy date; Elizabeth is still the woman of strong self-worth that I want to be. This anniversary year, I made my third pilgrimage to Jane Austen’s House in Chawton, Hampshire, where I got goosebumps, again, standing before Polaroids of Firth and Crispin Bonham-Carter (Mr Bingley) trying on top hats during a research visit. My next stop is Bath, for the big anniversary festival – and, for nostalgia’s sake, I’ll certainly binge all six glorious episodes, probably on the original air date, definitely with tea and cake."

    "raw_text": "It takes a lot of talent to make something as singular as Girls. Then 26-year-old Lena Dunham created, starred in and executive-produced the show. She frequently directed, and she wrote or co-wrote 41 of the extraordinarily raw, realistic (Girls’ sex scenes reduced most screen and polite conventions to rubble), brutally funny and occasionally simply brutal 62 episodes that comprised its six seasons between 2012 and 2017. Girls’ impeccably witty script and sublime characterisations meant it pulled off a near-impossible feat. It made the story of four solipsistic, privileged twentysomethings navigating their lives one sexual/professional/ youthful/contraceptive mistake at a time in New York City compelling, funny and meaningful. As Dunham’s character and semi-alter ego Hannah Horvath said of herself – she may not have been the voice of a generation, but she was definitely a voice of her generation.\nSince then, the output of a woman for whom the word “wunderkind” seemed woefully underpowered has itself been underwhelming. Dunham’s much-hyped first book did not deliver a fraction of the humour or insight Girls proved she was capable of – although certain passages did garner much publicity and controversy, a tradition she then continued with various ill-advised (or wilfully misinterpreted) comments on the #MeToo movement, writing out of imagination rather than lived experience and other hot button issues of the past decade or so. Her US remake of Julia Davis’s Camping was widely considered to have lost its originator’s bleak genius in translation, and Dunham’s adaptation of the beloved and brilliant children’s book Catherine Called Birdy, was an inoffensive bagatelle that did not detain critics or commerce long.\nBut now, at last, we have a new, original project from Dunham (with contribution from her now husband, indie musician Luis Felber). A television series, no less. Too Much follows the adventures of early-thirtysomething Jessica (Hacks’ formidable Megan Stalter) who flees to London from Brooklyn after a bad break-up. She remains obsessed with her ex, Zev (Michael Zegen), and with the woman he left her for, Instagram star and influencer Wendy (Emily Ratajkowski). She records emotional addresses to Wendy on her phone, privately, as self-therapy but of course this is the modern equivalent of Chekhov’s gun on the mantelpiece, and duly goes off in act three.\nBefore then, however, she has embarked on a relationship with – oh, the eternal mysteries of creation – indie musician Felix (White Lotus’s Will Sharpe, in another good-guy part that gives him nothing to get his teeth into and leaves him looking very flat indeed beside Stalter’s full-blooded role and performance). He is the antithesis of Zev – patient, laid-back, appreciative of her and never finding her “too much” as her ex, from very early in their relationship which somehow staggered on for eight years, contemptuously and contemptibly did.\nThere is a laboured joke in the first episode, about the difference between the English estate of Jessica’s period drama-informed imagination and the council flat she ends up in. This should serve as a warning to us all to lower our expectations drastically and save ourselves from as much of the quickly deepening disappointment as possible.\nAfter Jessica’s inaugural encounter with a British pub loo (you can, in fact, feel a very lived experience of Dunham here), the narrative landscape becomes an increasingly desolate place. Jessica sets fire to her nightdress and goes to hospital. Felix shows up with flowers and takes her home. Flashbacks to her life with Zev and an abortive date with a lying footballer show us how much better a bet the new guy is. They have a lot of sex and Dunham aims for her trademark realism – but without Girls’ inherent bleakness it just makes things tonally jarring for the viewer. It abandons any thoughts of innovation and hits cliche after cliche (how “the ick” can suddenly arrive and put you off your beloved for ever, for example – a well worn trope of the kind that would never have passed muster in Dunham’s earlier work). At one point, Felix even tells Jessica admiringly, “You’re so alive!” Not too much, you see! Alive! This guy is great.\nThere are a few good lines (“I want to make the world a better place for the children I don’t want and may never be ready for”) and insightful moments (Jessica using television programmes about people with lives even messier than hers to soothe herself to sleep) but the irreducible fact remains that Too Much would not be enough from anyone. From Dunham, it is way, way too little."

    "raw_text": "Cariad Lloyd is a comedian, writer and actor who specialises in improv. Nominated for best newcomer at the Edinburgh comedy awards in 2011, she has appeared in Toast of London, Inside No 9, QI and Would I Lie to You? She’s a regular performer in Austentatious, where the cast improvise an entire Jane Austen novel on stage. Lloyd’s podcast, Griefcast, won three awards at this year’s British podcast awards, including podcast of the year. In Griefcast, Lloyd talks to other people – often fellow comedians – about their feelings around the death of someone they love.\nWhat’s it like being Britain’s podcast queen?\nWell, they didn’t give me a crown, or a medal, so people out and about don’t know. Winning does make a difference. Our listeners have gone up. I had a lot of people coming up to me at the party afterwards, congratulating me, and then saying: “What is your podcast?”, and now they’ve listened.\nWhen Griefcast won podcast of the year, you dedicated your award to your dad, who died when you were young. What was he like?\nSomeone once described him like this: “You knew when he was in the room.” He was a big character, not horrible, just a bit difficult, a dominating character. He died when I was 15 of pancreatic cancer, and we didn’t have the greatest relationship at that time. I often wonder if it would have got better. He would have been smug about it, but I thought it was important to acknowledge him. I wanted to thank the dead people, because this podcast only exists because they died.\nDoes everyone deal with death differently?\nThe best comparison I’ve found is that death is like birth. You can talk to another woman who has given birth and there will be so many differences between what happened to you, but fundamentally you understand what each other is talking about. And you will both have experienced the same services: the ambulance service, people at the hospital, the funeral director… Everyone’s experience of someone they love dying is absolutely the same and absolutely different.\nYou talk on the show about the practical difficulties families have when someone dies suddenly, with things like bank accounts, and you recommend that we have a piece of paper with all our passwords on…\nPasswords are keys. Think of all the passwords you have to your accounts as being like keys to your house, so you think, I have to give a set to my family, to my best friend. You can do really simple things like just tell someone how many bank accounts you actually have, how much student loan you have to pay off. Otherwise, if you die, for your family it’s like: “Oh, another thing’s turned up that I have no idea how to sort out.” Also, I’m a big advocate of life insurance. Just get it. It can help cover the cost of a funeral. And make a will. We haven’t done that yet.\nYou made a very funny pilot for a TV sketch show, but it wasn’t commissioned…\nIt was my dream to do sketch shows, but they don’t exist. There used to be Big Train, The Fast Show, That Mitchell and Webb Look, and those would let comedians get exposure and lead to sitcoms. Now there’s just the chatty talking head shows. That’s why comedians are so desperate to get on them.\nHave you ever done any rubbish jobs?\nSo many. I was a temp, so I worked in a pub, I worked for a company advertising Viagra, I did environmental surveys. I was working in an investment bank when the crash happened. I’d be like: “Anyone want a coffee?” in meetings at an oil company when they were shouting stuff like: “We’ve got to get out of Iraq!” I’d be on reception answering phones when I could be bothered. I got fired for doing accents and speech impediments. I wasn’t cut out for it; I could never take anything seriously. They’d be like: “Would you mind doing something?”, and I’d say: “Actually, I’m on Facebook” and they’d say: “It’s not a question.” And then Sara Pascoe [Lloyd’s former flatmate] started doing standup and she came to me and said: “Listen, you get £10 for five minutes!” so I started doing that.\nHow do you do improv?\nThe basic principle is you don’t shut anyone or anything down. So if someone makes a statement or asks a question, your answer is: “Yes, and…” I think it’s a good rule for life. It says, Let’s work with this, rather than treat this person like they’re an idiot.\nHow is your baby?\nShe’s great. She’s started having really slow tantrums, rolling on the ground really slowly because I didn’t get up quickly enough to do whatever she wanted me to do. It makes me laugh.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "You won't remember the Jane Austen novel that pits government spy Double-O Darcy against a murderous French (or is it central Asian?) agent with a pet wolf. Austentatious has set itself the job of staging Austen's lost novels – or, put another way, improvising a new comic play, in the Regency style, every lunchtime on the free festival. The long queues suggest that this popular format is getting more so, and it's obvious why. The improvising is skilful but not attention-seeking, the sextet's team spirit is a joy to behold, and the laughs seldom stop. It's one of the most enjoyable 60 minutes on the fringe.\nThe Austen connection could be overstated. Yes, the company are in frocks, suits and boots. But – at least at this performance – the obligation to speak primly and observe period detail is just one other thing to play with and spark off. The story, triggered by a title from the audience, is arbitrary. I saw one that recast Darcy as a proto-James Bond, on a mission to defeat a lupine foe disguised as an English military man. (\"Born in Dorset, raised in Dorset!\"). In this, Darcy is aided by simpering secretary Celia, and betrayed by a distant ancestor of Miss Moneypenny.\nIt's throwaway. But you get wrapped up – if not in the story, then in seeing how well the performers can tell it. Happily, the team – which includes 2011 Comedy award nominee Cariad Lloyd – have a sound instinct for when to follow the gag, and when the narrative. It's very funny to watch them pursue the tortuous logic of whatever's blurted out of their mouths, daring their subconscious to resolve the narrative better than they can. (\"Have you ever lost both your parents in a wolf accident?\" Uncertain pause, then: \"Yes!\") There are no egos on stage, except when it might be funny to suggest otherwise. Far from the smugness or virtuosity of some improv, the Austentatious cast and audience unite in celebration of the pleasure of conjuring characters, plot and some very good jokes out of thin air.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "She has played spies, detectives and two queens of England. Now Olivia Colman is to take the part of Mrs Bennet, the scheming mother of five daughters, in a Netflix adaptation of Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice.\nThe six-part series will also star Emma Corrin as Elizabeth Bennet, and Jack Lowden as Mr Darcy. The adaptation will be written by the author and Sunday Times columnist Dolly Alderton.\nProduction on the series is scheduled to begin in the UK later this year. It will be directed by Euros Lyn, who also directed David Tennant in Doctor Who, three episodes of Broadchurch starring Colman and Tennant, and Happy Valley.\nMona Qureshi, a Netflix executive, said: “Pride and Prejudice is the ultimate romantic comedy.\n“Dolly’s fierce intelligence and enormous heart, twinned with her genuine love of the Austen novel, means she is able to bring new insights, whilst celebrating all that the generations of fans hold so dear.\n“The calibre of a cast led by Emma, Jack and Olivia is testament to this precious story being in the best possible hands.”\nCorrin, who played Diana, Princess of Wales, in the Netflix series The Crown, said: “Playing Elizabeth Bennet is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. To be able to bring this iconic character to life, alongside Olivia and Jack, with Dolly’s phenomenal scripts, is truly the greatest honour. I can’t wait for a new generation to fall in love with this story all over again.”\nAlderton said: “Once in a generation, a group of people get to retell this wonderful story and I feel very lucky that I get to be a part of it.”\nAusten’s 1813 novel was the “blueprint for romantic comedy”, she said, adding: “It has been a joy to delve back into its pages to find both familiar and fresh ways of bringing this beloved book to life.\n“The book is a gift to adapt – packed with drama and depth as well as comedy and charm. In it lies the opportunity to examine the complexities of love, family, friendship and society, while aspiring to Austen’s delightfully observational voice.\n“With Euros Lyn directing our stellar cast, I am so excited to reintroduce these hilarious and complicated characters to those who count Pride and Prejudice as their favourite book, and those who are yet to meet their Lizzie and Mr Darcy.”\nPride and Prejudice’s themes of love, social conventions, reputation, wealth and class have endured for more than two centuries. The novel, Austen’s second after Sense and Sensibility two years earlier, has been adapted for the big screen at least 17 times and made into television series in English, Italian, Dutch and Spanish.\nA 1995 BBC adaptation propelled Colin Firth to stardom after he emerged from a lake with his wet shirt clinging to his torso. He later said the scene “tended to create this image that can restrict what kind of roles you are going to be able to find”.\nA 2005 film version starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen is due to be rereleased this year for its 20th anniversary."

    "raw_text": "At 8.30am sharp, a white van pulls up to the North Carolina college campus where the Outsiders are huddled in their black shirts, sleepy-faced but in good spirits. They pile in quickly, knowing there is a tight schedule to stick to. A 10-minute drive from campus, then the van pulls up under the arch of a large metal gate crowned with razor wire.\nBy 8.45am, the Outsiders are standing in line, placing their possessions in plastic bins and waiting for the no-nonsense guards to pat them down and rifle through their things. They’re checking: are all cellphones securely locked in the van? Has the driver checked in their keys at the front desk? The Outsiders know the drill. They know that their clothing should be neutral and moderate. They know that IDs and visitor cards should be out and ready, bags open for inspection. Every beep of the metal detector makes everyone go tense, and slows things down. The Outsiders know that everything needs to go smoothly so that at 9am sharp we can make it to Room 209 of the main building where another no-nonsense guard is waiting impatiently to let us in. With him is a group of women in uniforms of various shades of blue. We know them as the Insiders. In here, they are known as the “offenders”.\nInsiders and Outsiders intermingle and take their seats. Class begins.\nWe are several weeks into the semester-long course, innocuously titled Introduction to Philosophy. The class, held each Friday morning for three hours at a women’s correctional facility near the college, is part of the US national Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program. There are 20 students on the course. Half are “Outside” students – that is, mostly 19- to 20-year-old residential students at the small liberal arts college where I teach. The other half are “Inside” students with a much broader range of age, background and life experience. Today, 17 are in attendance. We get the sad-but-happy news that Shauna has been released early. Debbie can’t make it because her cell is being searched for contraband. Michael has flu.\nSince the beginning, each class has started with a round of “silly socks”. The students came up with this on their own. It’s funny, you can try so hard to achieve a sense of equity here, to acknowledge and address the obvious and unavoidable differences that define this space. Insiders have no phones, no laptops, no internet service here, so Outsiders don’t either. Outsiders have access to resources such as office hours and tutoring, so Insiders should too. These black T-shirts with the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program logo are worn in part as Outsider uniforms in solidarity with Insiders, in part as a simple way of satisfying the dress-code requirements within the prison. But silly socks is what really brings us together – a student-led weekly ritual of showing off the loudest, silliest, craziest socks you’ve got, which lets the students be students. This week, Jenn, who is one year shy of completing a 15-year sentence for vehicular homicide, is Best in Show for the bright socks embellished with kitten faces she knitted herself.\nLast week, we began discussing Plato’s Republic – though the students didn’t realise it at the time. In fact, this time last week, many had never even heard of Plato, let alone the Allegory of the Cave. In the Allegory of the Cave, Plato compares us to captives who are chained by the neck deep within a cave, who do not yet understand that there is more to reality than the shadows they see projected on the wall. Or that education is the liberating force that allows us to perceive a reality beyond the shadows – painful though the light of truth may be at first.\nAs a matter of principle, before any text, lecture or assignment enters the picture, we start doing philosophy. We always start with discussion, and discussion always begins with a simple question. Last week, the question was: “What if everything you ever knew was a lie?” Without any mention of any scary-sounding words such as “metaphysics” or “epistemology”, the students were doing philosophy. The Outsiders complained that the media, especially social media, twists everything, makes everything seem not real. Some of the Insiders were intrigued and perplexed, having heard of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok but never used them. Several students expanded on this thinking, arguing that other things twisted the truth too, whether it was history, or capitalism, or other subjects they’d recently learned about in various college classes.\n“Ohhhh-ho-ho, you want to talk about a world of lies? Let me tell you about lies,” Jess jumps in. “Try getting stuck with a felony charge against a cop.” It goes on like this for more than an hour, each student sharing their own version of what the hell is happening in the cave. At noon sharp, the inmates are called to the mess hall. Inside students scramble to catch the narrow lunchtime window. We depart, agreeing that lies are everywhere, but still not sure if that means everything is a lie.\nThis week, we’ve read Book 7 of Plato’s Republic and are ready for discussion. In the past few weeks, I’ve observed how the Inside students have raised the bar for class preparation. They show up each week with the printed texts I left with them the week before, they take good notes, and they always have their writing assignments out and ready to discuss (many of which are hand-written, given how onerous it can be for the Inside students to type and print their work). I’ve noticed how Outside students have stepped up to match them, showing up prepared in a way that creates a sense of trust and mutual accountability well beyond anything I’ve witnessed in the college classroom.\nThe writing prompt I’ve given them for today’s class is a spin on the topic of last week’s discussion: what if you knew it was all a lie? What would you do differently?\nStudents anxiously look over their responses. A principle we’ve adopted for class discussion is that everyone has something to say, which in practice means everyone has to say something. By now, though, we know that Cassandra, who everyone calls “Queenie”, and who has the remarkable gift of always asking questions when she doesn’t understand something, will kick off the discussion with her trademark brand of comical scepticism.\n“What the hell is going on in that cave?” she blurts out, followed by a round of laughter. “Can you draw a picture or something, because I do not know what the hell is going on in that cave. All those shadows and shit …” I stand and go in search of some chalk. But just before I mark up the blank slate of chalkboard at the back of the room, Shelby, typically quite reserved in class discussion, excitedly suggests a live re-enactment. Turns out she’s a theatre major and is suddenly directing everyone to stand up and move to the front of the room, eager and determined to stage an impromptu performance of the Allegory of the Cave.\nSomeone jokes that now it’s time for the Outsiders to do some time. “Yeah,” Jacynda shouts. “How about y’all get locked up! Or wait, how’s he put it?” she asks, looking down at the desk and moving her finger over the text in front of her “… have your ‘legs and necks fettered’ so you can’t even move your head. That’s messed up!” Everyone is glad to see that the thick air of irony hanging over this scene is the good kind, the kind of irony we can laugh at.\nBut as the Outside students go to take their place at the front of the room, following Shelby’s dramaturgical orders, several Inside students rush to join the play-acting prisoners, a playful gesture of spontaneous solidarity that also reveals the meaningful bonds that have developed between the students over the past few weeks.\nA guard peeks in through the narrow glass window to check on the ruckus we have brewing.\nMy own view is that Socrates would be quite pleased with this scene. I think this is what philosophy should look like. Loud and rowdy. Everyone involved. Everyone engaged. A kaleidoscopic assortment of jokes, stories, anecdotes and philosophical insights powerful enough to make anyone forget about the so-called “crisis in the humanities”. But it’s not just more friendly and fun. These past few weeks have turned up some of the highest-quality philosophising I’ve ever witnessed. They highlight what’s often missing from many college classrooms, from the stale proceedings of many academic conferences, and certainly from bureaucratic rhetoric charged with protecting a tradition of humanistic studies.\n“So that’s what the hell is going on in the cave,” I say at the close of our lively re-enactment, as we take our seats at the horseshoe arrangement of brown, rectangular tables. “But what the hell kind of an allegory is this cave?” I ask. “Why do these imagined prisoners think these shadowy shapes are real? What are they supposed to do now that they’re unchained?”\n“Unfettered!” Queenie shouts.\nVictoria, who often has stories to tell about her granddaughters, quickly responds: “At first, I was like, ‘What the hell is this?’ I remember you said it was, like, thousands of years old and, when I started reading it, I was like, yeah, it sounds like it!” This gets a good laugh. “But then I started thinking,” she continues, striking a more serious tone, “it’s kinda like what happens in here. You spend enough time in here and you start to think this is all there is. You forget the world out there. So like who said what and who did what is all you start to care about. It’s like your reality, and you forget it’s not like that on the outside.”\n“Except this is your reality,” Jenn chimes in. “You are a prisoner, and you’ve been in prison 15 years because you decided to get into your car when you were too fucked up and you ran over somebody. That’s reality.” Everyone is silent for a moment, sitting with the realisation that both interpretations must be right.\n“But what about all the misinformation,” asks David, the class clown who started the silly socks tradition. “All the crazy QAnon conspiracy theories and stuff. The anti-vaxxers and flat-earthers. The alt-right pipeline stuff?”\nThe Insiders look confused, unsure of this strange new dialect spoken among young people. At times like this it’s clear that, on top of racial, generational, socioeconomic and experiential differences, it’s sometimes just a language barrier that separates one reality from another. But this also creates openings between them. Outsiders tell Insiders about “deepfakes” and “cancel culture”, and the Insiders tell Outsiders about “Bo-Bos” (prison shoes) and “dry snitching”, which, as Queenie explains animatedly, is when somebody rats somebody out without naming names.\nJacynda, the youngest Insider, is not afraid to flex her glorious gift for whip-smart oratory in laying out why Plato is just trying to get us to think about who we should trust: “These people over here locking us up and throwing shadows at us, or these people over here coming in here telling us we’re free now, just come along with us even though your eyes are burning from the bright light? Who are these motherfuckers, anyway? Oh lemme guess – they’re supposed to be the philosophers?”\n“That’s right,” I admit. “The philosophers.” And everyone has a good laugh.\nPhilosophy’s relationship to the prison has evolved since Plato’s time, from analogy to reality. So many great works of philosophy were written in incarceration – for example, Martin Luther King Jr’s oft-quoted Letter from Birmingham Jail, where he was held in April 1963 on charges of unlawful protest against racial segregation. Back up nearly one and a half millennia, and we find On the Consolation of Philosophy, written by the late-Roman philosopher Boethius while in prison awaiting execution on trumped-up charges of treason. There is Bertrand Russell’s Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, written during a stint in Brixton prison in 1918 for voicing pacifist views against the US joining the first world war. Meanwhile, Ludwig Wittgenstein was a prisoner of war while he compiled the notes that became the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921). Thinkers such as Viktor Frankl, Emmanuel Levinas and Jean-Paul Sartre scrawled groundbreaking works under Nazi imprisonment, and the Italian Marxist thinker Antonio Gramsci wrote his prison notebooks while imprisoned by Italian fascists.\nEventually, some philosophers came around to philosophising about prisons too. Leave it to a British utilitarian to draw up both the intellectual and the architectural blueprints for one of the most notorious conceptions of carceral punishment. Granted, Jeremy Bentham’s discussion of the infamous panopticon is but one aspect of his sprawling treatise The Rationale of Punishment (1830), a utilitarian justification of state-sanctioned force to uphold a social order of laws. Granted also that the outsized scholarly airtime that Bentham’s prison plans have received is due largely to the dramatised analysis offered by the French poststructuralist Michel Foucault. In Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison (1975), Foucault describes the idea of enforced reform through constant, anonymous surveillance as central to the “cruel, ingenious cage” of the panopticon. This notion of absolute power through one-directional observation has itself proved an influential metaphor in the philosophy of prisons, furnishing a conceptual language of surveillance that has found its way into more recent critiques of digital tracking, data collection and the like.\nGive Bentham some credit, though. Even under the sinister threat of uncertain, anonymous surveillance, he imagined the prison as a place of learning. Somewhere within the vortex of solitary cells would be a space in which prisoners could find restoration through education. “The prison should be their school,” says Bentham, a dedicated advocate of universal education. Alas, what Bentham has in mind is corrective education, an enforced moralising influence valued only for its capacity to offer “great assistance in changing the habits of the mind” and of “elevating” self-esteem.\nPerhaps education has these and similar benefits to offer the incarcerated. But, of course, that’s not exactly what we’re going for in this class. What good, then, are we doing in the name of prison education?\nWe’ve come a long way in prison philosophy. While we continue to philosophise about prison, there has been a welcome increase in efforts to philosophise in prison. I highly recommend Andy West’s The Life Inside (2022), a lovely memoir that illustrates the impact of these rich discussions on men who may seem unlikely beneficiaries of philosophical practice (see also West’s Aeon essay Inside Ambiguity). Kirstine Szifris’s book Philosophy Behind Bars (2021) draws on her experience teaching in prison to make a compelling case for the value of this kind of education for the growth and development of incarcerated individuals. Between 2005 and 2013, the Guardian ran a series of articles on philosophy in prisons, the bulk of them written by a veteran prison educator, Alan Smith. And, while not strictly speaking a philosophical text, Ahmet Altan’s autobiography I Will Never See the World Again (2018), about his political imprisonment in Turkey, is rich with philosophical insight.\nMeanwhile, a host of prison education schemes have cropped up in recent years, many of them in the context of higher education. In addition to the Inside-Out Prison Exchange Program, these initiatives include the Prisons and Justice Initiative at Georgetown University in Washington DC and the Bard Prison Initiative in New York, among others. A few of these are even philosophy-specific, such as the Philosophy in Prison charity in the UK, which includes outreach collaborations with centres such as the Uehiro Oxford Institute.\nOf course, for Plato, it isn’t only about escaping the cave. Equally important is the responsibility of the liberated to return to the cave to see to the liberation of others. These and similar programmes can be seen as a modern-day effort to make good on the responsibility to put education toward emancipatory ends, particularly for those who have been systematically deprived of such opportunities. This is, I think, a crucial component of what has recently been billed as “public philosophy”, especially insofar as it is focused on a population often excluded from both philosophical and social conceptions of “the public”. In notable contrast to the liberalist tradition of conceiving “the public” abstractly, as an undifferentiated mass of rights-bearing individuals, one of the chief values of a philosophical practice that engages with incarcerated communities is that it proceeds from a non-ideal notion of “the public” in the name of public philosophy – one that aims to include those often excluded from the centre of public life, denied certain rights and opportunities, and cut off from the benefits of political and social participation. Put differently, teaching philosophy in prisons is one of the best ways of doing public philosophy.\nNotice, however, that the value of such initiatives is pretty much always framed in terms of the good that philosophy affords the incarcerated. At a certain practical level, this must be so, given that programmes such as the one that make it possible for us to sit in a room and discuss Plato’s Republic depend on external, sometimes uncertain sources of funding, which in turn depend on convincing the right people that the prison population is the direct beneficiary of such programmes. But this way of thinking is also very much present in current academic research on the value of philosophy in prisons. In an essay by Duncan Pritchard on doing philosophy in prisons, for example, we learn there is empirical evidence that philosophy can improve “the intellectual virtues, and thereby the intellectual character, of the students” as well as “important personal and interpersonal skills”. Similarly, others have claimed that philosophy in prisons “can give voice to those who are marginalised, shine a light on injustices, expose the root of social problems and empower others to seek solutions”.\nSuppose all of this is right. Suppose the virtues of doing philosophy in prisons are plentiful and the benefits are real. Still, the question remains whether and to what extent the benefit is mutual. Assuming philosophy can and does do great things for the prison population, we might also ask: what can philosophy in prisons do for philosophy?\nTo clarify – the question here is not so much, “What do I, the philosopher, get out of it?” Of course, I do think philosophers can and do learn a great deal from the striking insights that incarcerated students regularly offer. But if we’re discussing the value of teaching philosophy – that is, helping students to think critically about the present – much is to be gained by putting students in prisons. And the students agree.\nTo understand why, let’s begin with some of the more positive generalisations commonly made about our gen Z students. These include: adaptability, digital literacy, political activism (particularly in the name of diversity, equality and social justice), a striking ability to remain optimistic in the face of staggering global calamity, and plenty more. It’s not clear, however, that an aptitude for a productive exchange of differing views belongs with these virtues. Let me say first that I’m fully aware of the absurd caricature often drawn by reactionaries and rightwing media of what happens on college campuses (look no further than the fit-throwing over so-called “safe spaces”). But a generalisation I hear many of my co-educators making today expresses genuine concern about the willingness of some students to hear out different perspectives and make good-faith efforts to seek common ground within what the philosopher Wilfrid Sellars called “the space of reasons”.\nSo far as I can see, there’s little doubt that our students’ hearts are in the right place. But as any clear-eyed educator can tell you, there’s something of a value shift going on, where what matters to the students is that other people see their virtue, not that we effectively promote these qualities, or actually succeed in changing hearts and minds. This should be particularly disconcerting for philosophers, who are in the business of giving and asking for reasons. It’s true that sometimes students’ comments sound more like proclamations looking for a round of approving finger snaps from peers than genuine contributions to class discussion. More worrying, however, is that diminishing engagement with a range of diverse perspectives threatens to turn the classroom into an echo chamber – a place where you no longer trust people from the other side.\nAll of this disappeared the moment my students stepped into a prison. No flexing of pre-approved talking points. No language policing. No impending threats of cancellation. With no more guidance from me than the standard expectations of respectful discourse, the class immediately cultivated, as if by magic, an ethos of listening-not-judging that shaped the entirety of our experience together. Inside students had no trouble making clear the value of this unique opportunity. For some, it was a way to connect with the outside world that helped prepare for re-entry. For others, it was college credit that would look good on a résumé. For others still, it was a meaningful distraction from the monotony of incarceration. The value it held for Outside students, however, is harder to articulate.\nLet me give an example. When putting together the syllabus for this course, I debated whether or not to include a section on the philosophy of prisons. On one hand, I saw only landmines. Would Outside students want to share any thoughts about prisons, and would anyone want them to? What kinds of thought would the Inside students want to share about prison? What if the class spawned a prison abolitionist movement within a prison? Maybe we should just stick to prison analogies, I thought.\nOn the other hand, if the writings of Angela Davis tell us anything, it is to use your imagination, take some risks and try something different. It also happened that Tommie Shelby’s superb monograph The Idea of Prison Abolition (2022) had just been published: with its extensive engagement with Davis in making the case for prison reform, it made an excellent companion to Davis’s bombshell Are Prisons Obsolete? (2003). So I took a risk and imagined it would go well.\nThe primer to this, however, was a simple question: “Assuming prisons aren’t perfect, should we try to fix them, or should we try to get rid of them? Quick, without thinking – show of hands: left hand fix, right hand abolish. On the count of three, ready …”\nExactly 10 right hands were raised – every single one the hand of an Outside student – to abolish, while all the nine left hands raised to fix were of an Inside student. (Debbie had been transferred earlier in the week.)\nAmazing.\nThings got so loud and rowdy after this spectacular show of difference that a guard stopped by and tapped his knuckles on the window.\nThe following Friday morning, just after silly socks, I ask for the same show of hands. This time, no one raises a hand. This is because, as each of them is ready to explain, with texts and notes at the ready, it turns out that reformers and abolitionists aren’t that different after all. Everyone is waiting for Queenie, who just says: “Oh, I love Angela now.” (They’re on first-name terms.)\nBut this week, it’s someone else who kicks things off. Simone, who had said very little in class until last week when it was time to advocate for prison abolition, jumps in early to say that Tommie pretty much agrees with Angela because they’re both talking about the same reforms to prison: social services, drug treatment, education.\n“Yeah,” Queenie concurs, and explains that what Angela is really trying to say is that “instead of just throwing folks in prison for doing something they shouldn’t, they should just use their imagination. Take some risks. Try something different.”\nA crackle of loudspeaker interrupts, followed by a sequence of beeps, each more disconcerting than the last. “Lockdown,” say several Insiders in unison. “We’re gonna be here for a while,” Jess adds. And with that, we settle right back into discussion.\nSome names have been changed to protect privacy."

    "raw_text": "To review certain books seems like an impertinence. This is one of them. It speaks for itself with such clarity, certainty and wisdom that only one thing needs to be said: read it. And then read it again. It is a short book, divided into brief chapters, some no longer than two pages, each recounting some incident from the author’s prison experience. It is wonderfully distilled, but not sententious; even in extremis, Altan never loses the limpidity and translucence, vivid with the vividness of dreams, which is characteristic of his other writing – as far as one can judge from the only other books of his available in English translation, Like a Sword Wound, the superb first volume of his Ottoman Quartet; and Endgame, a phantasmagorical crime story. Even the latter has, at the heart of all the violence, a dreamy, wide-eyed quality that seems to be quintessential Altan. To judge by I Will Never See the World Again, it has been and will be his salvation.\nHis arrest was no surprise to him. He was in the frontline. As the author of Atakurd, a much-read piece in Milliyet newspaper arguing for equal status for Kurds, he had, as early as 1995, received a suspended 20-month sentence, and been fined $12,000. In 2007, he founded and edited the satirical newspaper Tara, in which, a year later, he wrote a piece called Oh My Brother. For this, he was charged under the draconian Article 301 of the Turkish penal code that criminalises “denigrating Turkishness”, though not, at that time, imprisoned. Knowing how exposed his position was, he habitually carried a gun.\nDissidence is the Altan family business: Ahmet’s father Çetin, a polemical journalist, novelist, editor and MP, had been apprehended nearly half a century before by an earlier repressive regime. When the police came to get him, Altan senior offered them tea; they refused it. “It’s not a bribe,” he remarked, pleasantly. “You can drink some.” The joke didn’t go down very well. Four and a half decades later, Ahmet repeated it to the policemen who came for him; they were equally unamused. To be making jokes at all in the circumstances reveals an almost inconceivable sangfroid. He knew that there was no chance whatever of a fair trial; the sentence was a foregone conclusion.\nNever again would I be able to kiss the woman I love, embrace my kids, meet with my friends, walk the streets … I would not be able to eat eggs with sausage or drink a glass of wine or go to a restaurant and order fish. I would not be able to watch the sunrise.\nIn the car that took him to prison, the guard offered him a cigarette. “I only smoke when I am nervous,” replied Altan. He had, he said, no idea where the words came from. But they changed his life. “There are certain actions and words that are demanded by the events, the dangers and the realities that surround you. Once you refuse to play this assigned role, instead doing and saying the unexpected, reality itself is taken aback; it hits against the rebellious jetties of your mind and breaks into pieces.” This insight – “Reality could not conquer me. I conquered reality” – gave him the strength to face what followed. He saw that this capacity was an extension of his trade as a novelist: creating an alternative reality. I Will Never See the World Again is as much about writing as it is about prison, but above all it is about freedom, a freedom epitomised by the exercise of the imagination.\nHis liberty and independence of thought were not effortlessly maintained: whatever your inner fortitude, prison, by its very nature, is crippling. “In a matter of 5 hours I had travelled across five centuries to arrive at the dungeons of the Inquisition.” The sensory deprivation was immediately disorienting: like Oscar Wilde, he discovered that time ceases to mean anything. “The air and the light in our cage never changed. Each minute was the same as the last. It was as if a tributary of the river of time had hit a dam and formed a lake. We sat at the bottom of that motionless pool.”\nTaken to court, the disorientation continued. The judges were out of Kafka, but as in Kafka, not savage or brutal, but erratic, bewildering, surreal. He found that he had been arrested not, as originally stated, for sending “subliminal messages” in support of the attempted coup, but for having participated in it. Challenged as to the change of charge, the judge, remarked, airily: “Our prosecutors like using words the meanings of which they don’t know.”\nHe was released and returned home; later that evening, a new warrant is issued and he is back in prison, put into a cell marked Ladies’ Infirmary. He launches an appeal, based on the Supreme Court’s rejection of his conviction: as he waits for the verdict, he tries to dismiss “the pale flickering dreams fed by hope” that “stir shyly in the shadowy folds of my mind”. He begins to realise as he waits that he is living out the very scene that he wrote years earlier in his novel Like a Sword Wound, where a character also waits for a verdict. “Years ago as I was wandering in that unmarked, enigmatic and hazy territory where literature meets life. I had met my own destiny but failed to recognise it; I wrote thinking it belonged to someone else. I feel I am being dragged into a vertiginous, wuthering vortex in which novel and life are entangled, where what is real and what is written imitate one another and change places, each disguised as the other.”\nThe verdict is handed down: life, without parole.\nI will never see the world again; I will never see a sky unframed by the walls of a courtyard. I am descending to Hades. I walk into the darkness like a god who writes his own destiny. My hero and I disappear into the darkness together.\nBut in time, his imagination saves him:\nLike Odysseus, I will act with heroism and cowardice, with honesty and craftiness. I will know defeat and victory, my adventure will end only in death … a ship stands in the middle of the cell; its timbers are creaking. On its deck is a conflicted Odysseus.\nIn a heart-stopping moment, he thinks to himself:\nWhat a beautiful scene to describe. I reach for a pen with a hand that is white in the ghostly light. I can write even in the dark. I take the ship cracking in the storm in the palm of my hands and begin writing. The prison door shut behind me.\nPut together from papers found among notes Altan gave to his lawyers, and translated – superbly – into English by his friend Yasemin Çongar, I Will Never See the World Again is deeply satisfying in form. It is not Midnight Express; it is not From the House of the Dead, and it is not De Profundis. In a sense, it eclipses all of these. It is a radiant celebration of the inner resources of human beings, above all those triggered by the imagination. Its account of the creative process is sublime, among the most perfectly expressed analyses of that perpetually elusive phenomenon. And it is a triumph of the spirit. “You can imprison me but you cannot keep me here. Because, like all writers, I have magic,” Altan says in his final phrases. “I can pass through your walls with ease.” Yes: but enough is enough. He is still in prison. Eighty Nobel prize-winners have protested, unsuccessfully. We must move heaven and earth to spring him."

    "raw_text": "As a former prison officer, I have opened thousands of cell doors. For almost a decade, I unlocked cells in residential blocks, healthcare units, first night centres, close supervision centres and segregation units. The twist and click of a key in the lock came to feel like background noise to me. But there are some occasions I remember more vividly than others. Sometimes the person inside wasn’t so keen on coming out.\nOne of those challenging incidents took place a few years ago, while I was on shift in a segregation unit in a busy London jail. Prisoners are sent to the seg for a variety of reasons – fights, assaults on staff, possession of contraband – but normally for no longer than a week or two. The seg was made up of 18 single cells spread over two storeys. I was in a team of six, all of us in full riot gear. We were moving a mentally ill prisoner who had destroyed his cell and then flooded it with sewage because he believed we were planning to implant a chip in his brain. His story is not an isolated one. In 2024, the chief inspector of prisons published a report showing that prisons are having to wait an average of 85 days to send acutely mentally unwell prisoners to secure hospitals.\nThe government has responded to the overcrowding crisis by letting some prisoners out early. Given that prisons were operating at 99.9% capacity, I’m not sure there was any other option. But the early release scheme isn’t a long-term solution. Data published by the Ministry of Justice has shown that recalls to prison have increased by 42% since the early release scheme was implemented. No prison officer in the country will be surprised by that. According to the most recent figures, assaults on prison staff occur almost hourly, suicides by prison inmates have risen by nearly 25% and 70% of inmates feel unsafe. But numbers don’t do justice to the human impact of all this. They can’t show you what it’s really like.\nOfficers are on the frontline every day, struggling to keep inmates and themselves safe. When there is a fight, someone has to break it up. A suicide attempt: someone must do CPR. A hostage incident: someone needs to negotiate. And when there is a person in “the box” – a single empty cell within the segregation unit – someone has to be the one to unlock that door. Someone has to be the one holding the shield. And, at the end of the day, that person puts on their coat and walks home.\nBack in January 2016, I lived no more than five minutes from the category B prison in London where I worked. I’d been a prison officer for a few years by that point, but the uniform still felt bulky and ill fitting. When I arrived, walking through the gatehouse and past the lockers crammed with batons and cuffs, the air felt just as cold inside the prison as it did outside. But the smells were nastier, particularly in the unit I’d been assigned to that day.\nIn the segregation unit there were pools of shit leaking out from under the white screens erected opposite cell 6. The screens were in place to prevent faeces and urine hitting officers as they walked past. For the most part they were effective. But if a prisoner was persistent enough, they could aim it just right so when the mixture of shit and piss and water hit the screens, it slid down and under. Mensah (not his real name), a tall prisoner in his 50s, had smashed the observation panel and was posting what he affectionately termed “shit parcels” through it several times a day.\nHe’d had enough practice at dirty protests. He was well known in all the London jails. He went from seg to seg destroying each cell he was put in, immersing broken furniture in the flood he’d caused by smashing the sink and taking apart the plumbing. He’d done a long time in Broadmoor, the high-security psychiatric hospital, but had eventually been considered stable enough to be returned to prison. Sadly, his period of stability did not last long. He was clearly mentally unwell, more than happy to live in a sea of his own detritus and convinced that almost every passing female officer was his wife. “What the fuck are you doing working in this place, Marie?” he would scream at every woman he saw.\nIt wasn’t just the smell that hit you as soon as you walked into the seg. It was the noise too. The other seg prisoners would kick their cell door repeatedly, bang after bang after bang that reverberated throughout the unit, so relentless that it felt like the walls were shaking. They’d shout and bang and smash their observation panel, shards of glass sometimes exploding from the rectangular window in their cell door.\nThe seg was like a smaller version of a residential wing. There were cells, an exercise yard, a servery for meals, and a desk on the ground floor where staff completed paperwork and answered phone calls. An office on the ground floor was reserved for what were known as adjudications. Each weekday the duty governor would sit behind a polished mahogany table, with a painting of the queen hanging above them, to hear the charges for which officers around the jail had placed prisoners on report: possession of a phone, fighting, assault, destroying prison property, threatening and abusive behaviour. On the day of their hearing, the prisoners would file noisily into the seg before being locked in a holding room to wait their turn. One by one they walked into the office to see the governor. But most of them didn’t have to stay on the seg. Almost all returned to the wing, carrying a punishment as well as their paperwork: loss of association (banned from mixing with others) maybe, or denied access to the prison shop, known as the canteen, for a couple of weeks.\nI remember thinking that it seemed particularly unfair to give a prisoner seg time given the smells emanating from Mensah’s cell. The two prisoners in the cells either side of him had been returned to their wing for the rest of their confinement period.\nIn the seg, at the far end of the ground floor landing, was a cell known as “the box”. It was just an empty room. No bed, chair, or toilet. The most violent and disruptive prisoners were held in there, though not for long. Almost as soon as someone was put in the box, governors were making plans to try to have them moved back to a normal cell. That’s still the process today. The box is sometimes the safest place for a prisoner to be; they have no access to materials they could use to harm themselves or others. But locking a man in a literal box is no one’s idea of rehabilitation. It’s a last resort.\nThere was no one in the box that day. There were 16 men locked in their cells, awaiting a regime of phone call, exercise and shower. Some weren’t bothered about going out in the yard, but most wanted a shower and a phone call. So the staff were tasked with facilitating a minimum of 16 individual regimes throughout the day while simultaneously making sure that no two prisoners were unlocked at the same time and ensuring that each man was checked on at least once an hour. It was a busy and challenging unit. Even if prisoners were considered safe to go on the yard together, they had to be escorted there one at a time by a minimum of two officers. This was problematic in 2016, but with the staffing crisis as dire as it is today, it is impossible to imagine how such a regime can be delivered without compromising both staff and prisoner safety.\nIn very exceptional circumstances, a prisoner would be considered so dangerous that they were only unlocked by a senior officer plus six officers, each wearing a full kit of blue fire-retardant overalls, leg guards, arm guards, balaclava, helmet and stab vest. When I joined the prison service in 2012, stab-proof vests didn’t exist for officers. Nor did Pava – pepper spray that was rolled out in all-adult male prisons in 2020. The use of Pava is contentious, but at the very least it recognises the increased danger facing prison officers today. Staff assaults were once comparatively rare. That is no longer the case. But while physical support measures may have increased, the emotional support available to frontline prison staff is lacking. Analysis released last year found that prison and probation staff took the equivalent of more than 770 years’ worth of mental health sick leave in 2023.\nThat particular day, I made my way towards the unit with an experienced seg officer named Rob (he asked me not to use his last name). He was a good friend of mine. When a prisoner from the wing I worked on was being segregated, it was almost always Rob who would be there to meet us. It was almost always him I saw after a serious fight or assault. Almost always him waiting on the concrete steps leading to the segregation unit to escort the cuffed man inside. And I was relieved every time. Rob knew the seg inside out, knew all the paperwork and adjudication charges and regime timings. And he knew the men too, the ones who were regulars, who handled seg life far better than they did being on the wing. Seg officers were often disliked by prisoners because they represented an even closer form of confinement. But Rob was respected.\nWe walked past one of the wings housing more than 300 men. Most of the cell windows looking out on to the green remained intact. The majority of these prisoners were employed as barbers, servery workers or corridor cleaners. The nature of their jobs meant that most of them were out of their cells a lot, so they rarely felt the need to smash things. From the outside, there were no obvious signs announcing the approach to the segregation unit unless you knew what to look for. As we stepped on to the path outside, the grass rustled with the noise of rats picking through the litter. Above us, the cell windows were smashed. From inside came the constant thumping of men booting their door.\nAt least one seg prisoner was not kicking his door. Instead he was dangling his legs out of the window. Most prisoners destroyed their surroundings because they were bored, fed up, angry. But Maxim (not his real name) wasn’t angry. He was cheerful, if anything. He waved at us, then shouted something in Russian. He was something of a celebrity in the prison, having been repeatedly segregated for damage to prison property. That wasn’t an offence which would normally warrant segregation, but with Maxim it felt like the only option left. Because the damage he was causing wasn’t ordinary. He wasn’t breaking his furniture or ripping up bedsheets. He had turned his cell into a kitchen. It wasn’t entirely clear how. He’d removed the base plates from prison-issue kettles and wired them up to the light fitting to make miniature stoves.\nAn officer on night patrol caught him doing this in the early hours of the morning, so his electricity had been switched off. Maxim wasn’t hurting anyone as he set about making himself a meal, but it was a fire risk. For most prisoners, losing their electricity supply would mean game over: no cup of tea, no TV, no lights. And yet when the officer walked past Maxim’s cell again an hour or so later, the lights were back on. Maxim was stretched out on his bed watching TV with a cup of hot tea in his hand. Again, no one was really sure how he’d done it. Rob and I rounded the corner beneath Maxim’s window and climbed the steps to the segregation unit. The moment we were inside, the smell was all I could think about. The kind of smell that gets into your throat and makes your eyes water. I rarely wore my balaclava for planned removals, but that day I couldn’t get it on quick enough. I changed into my control and restraint kit in the adjudication room, the queen smiling at me as I slammed the visor of my helmet down.\nMensah knew we were coming He’d done this many times before. We stopped outside his door – six of us, ready to go. Rob held the shield before him, elevated at a slight angle. I stood slightly behind and to the right of him while another officer mirrored me on the left. Rob’s voice was loud and steady.\n“Mensah, go to the back of your cell. Hands on your head.”\nWhen he spoke, the seg quietened. Prisoners peered through the crack between their cell door and the doorframe.\n“Yeah, guv, I already am,” said Mensah. “It’s all good, guv. I won’t fight.”\nRob nodded at the senior officer, who reached round the shield and unlocked the door, then stepped back immediately. Rob leaned forward and pushed the cell door open. From my position, I could just about see Mensah stood at the back of the cell, facing the wall, wearing only boxers and socks. The cell was a mess. Broken table legs were scattered about the floor, bits of paperwork floated in the water from the smashed sink, a mug full of watery shit was balanced on the end of the bed.\nMensah turned. With his hands still on his head, he started walking towards us, his feet occasionally knocking against furniture and detritus.\n“Keep going. Keep your hands on your head.”\nRob and Mensah were going through the motions. But they both knew how this would go. Mensah took small steps, his smile getting wider. He was inches from the shield. As instructed, Mensah took his hands from his head, slowly. But he didn’t turn around. The tension was palpable. I stayed in position. The three staff behind pressed in closer.\n“Mensah,” said Rob.\nAny second.\nI saw Mensah’s right fist as it clenched. Rob held the shield firm.\nAnd then, bang. Mensah punched the shield. Rob dropped his head and drove the shield forward, pushing Mensah back into the cell. In a second the steady control of command and compliance was gone, everyone was splashing around, and Mensah was yelling about killers and spies and government agents. He was spinning and kicking, his limbs flailing and ours too as we tried to grab hold of him. He slipped in the water and crashed to the ground. Two of us managed to get hold of his arms while Rob supported his head to make sure his nose and mouth stayed clear of the stinking water. The noise around us was deafening. The other prisoners were kicking their doors and thumping their kettles against the windows.\nWhen we did eventually get Mensah to his feet, he calmed slightly.\n“They’re trying to put metal chips in me,” Mensah said.\n“No one is going to hurt you,” Rob said. “We just want to put you in a clean cell. You can’t stay in here. We’re going right next door. The cell is ready.”\n“But if the cell is dirty, they can’t get the chips in. If it’s clean, it’s too easy for them.”\nMensah turned and growled at me. But he knew Rob, and even in his confusion he seemed to trust him. His hands were filthy, calloused and swollen and streaked with cuts. As we walked slowly out of the cell, rotating our little unit out of the doorway, I looked back and saw that Mensah had written “fuck govment” on the wall above his bed. But not in pen – he wasn’t permitted to have a pen. He’d written it in his own faeces.\nHard as that job was, I knew I was lucky. My encounter with Mensah was extremely unpleasant, but at least I knew I was safe. I was surrounded by experienced officers who took pride in their work and understood the nuance of the job. Today, that is rare. Nearly half of prison officers resign after less than three years. And I also felt certain that I was doing the right thing. Mensah may not have understood why he needed to leave that cell, but we did. We did our best to keep him safe until he got the help he needed. It is even harder for staff to do the right thing now, when there are so few of them and prisons are so overcrowded, conditions so poor and basic resources so sparse.\nMensah embodied the paradox which so often curdles inside prison staff. He was pitied and yet reviled. Pitied because he lived in his own shit, and no one in their right mind would choose to live like that. Reviled because it was us he threw the shit at. There were many officers who seemed to have endless reserves of resilience, but there were others who were cruel and antagonising, who said things to wind prisoners up behind their door but were nowhere to be seen when it was time for the door to be opened.\nMensah shouldn’t have been in that segregation unit. He shouldn’t have been in prison. He should have been in hospital. But where? When I spoke about his case to a forensic psychologist who had prior experience as an operational prison officer, he said: “We work with what we’ve got.” And what we had was not a lot. A shortage of beds inside medium- and high-security hospitals means a prisoner experiencing acute mental distress might have to wait months to be transferred to a hospital. The staff inside those hospitals do an incredible job, but they couldn’t make the process any quicker. And Mensah had to go somewhere. He was serving an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence for possession of an offensive weapon. He’d first been jailed in 2006. Ten years later, he was still behind bars with no release date, no goals to set, no plans to make. Mensah’s original offence had involved threats but no actual violence. Yet now his violence was real. We were witnessing the impact an indeterminate sentence can have on a person’s mental state.\nMensah was also a prolific drug user. Maybe that made things easier for him, a kind of escape. It certainly wasn’t difficult for him to get hold of the illicit substances. In recent years, drug rehab wings have been introduced in prisons across England and Wales with the intention of breaking prisoners’ addictions. But simply labelling a wing “drug free” is not enough. It is certainly not enough when drones can deliver packages direct to cell windows. The staggering rise in drone incidents in prison demonstrates just what staff are up against. A freedom of information request by the Guardian found there were 1,296 drone incidents at prisons in England and Wales in the 10 months to the end of October 2024, a tenfold increase since 2020.\nPrisoners like Mensah aren’t the norm – most men in segregation units will serve their designated seg time and then return to the wings – but nor was it an anomaly. There are men like him in segs up and down the country. Sometimes they reach their release date and there’s no legal reason to hold them any longer, so they’re let out on to the streets, confused and agitated and barely able to manage their own personal hygiene, never mind navigate the outside world. Sometimes they make it to a secure hospital, and after a few months’ treatment they return to prison stabilised, at least temporarily, with the right medication and support.\nAnd so Mensah was moved between the segregation unit and the healthcare unit, spending a few days at a time in each to give the staff a bit of respite before he was transferred to another prison. There he would resume his dirty protests. On one occasion he also pulled all his teeth out. After that he was transferred not to a hospital but to yet another prison.\nInvesting in prisons means investing in people. That includes the staff. Prisons are made safe by officers who know those environments well, who understand the unique challenges they pose and who have the time to develop relationships with the prisoners in their care. Those skills come with time. Experience won’t come from the three years most prison officers spend in the job before deciding it’s not worth it. The cuts made to public services have been catastrophic. Austerity has stripped our prison service to the bone. And yet while many would prefer to look away, there are those who keep showing up, despite knowing exactly what they will face when they get there.\nBy the end of 2021, I’d had enough. Staffing shortages had made the job too unsafe. We were at the point of letting prisoners out for association just once every three days. That kind of regime leads to boredom, frustration, acute psychological illness and devastating violence. After prisoner-on-prisoner murders at two of the jails where I worked, I waited for decent staff-support programmes that never came. The rate at which prison officers are now leaving the service should alarm us all. And it should be the catalyst for change. Because reform isn’t possible without officers there to unlock the doors."

    "raw_text": "As two scientists who lived through Australia’s black summer bushfires and the Covid-19 crisis in the United States, we have seen firsthand how science in modern societies is under siege from an even more insidious “antiscience virus” of weaponised disinformation that undermines our ability to confront these crises.\nThere are five primary, interconnected forces behind the assault on science and reason. We call them the “five Ps”: the plutocrats, the petrostates, the pros (eg paid promoters of anti-science), the propagandists and – with important exceptions – the media. Together they have generated a perfect storm of antiscientific disinformation that now threatens humanity.\nA nefarious web of actors including plutocrats in the US and Australia, along with libertarian tech bros, and petrostates such as Russia and Saudi Arabia fund and amplify deceitful, ideologically motivated antiscience. They collectively employ weaponised social media outlets, podcasts and rightwing cable news broadcasts as their preferred tools. The objective is to inundate the public with fossil fuel-friendly propaganda that undermines climate action or public health measures including vaccinations. Scientists are often portrayed as enemies or villains. The well of public opinion so critical to informed voting is poisoned.\nWhen Mike was in Australia during the 2020 black summer, he warned about the threat posed by the climate denialism of the Murdoch media empire with its dominant and pernicious influence on the media landscape. Yet despite this adverse media environment, the Australian people proved remarkably resilient to disinformation campaigns.\nThat doesn’t mean that Australian politicians are yet fully on board with the actions necessary to avert catastrophic warming. Mike and his colleague Chris Wright (not the climate-sceptic fossil fuel executive appointed US Department of Energy secretary by Donald Trump, but the University of Sydney business school climate policy expert) criticised the previous Coalition government for their obstinate resistance to decarbonisation. Australia ranked last among UN member countries in climate ambition under the Coalition rule. And the current Labor government continues rightly to be criticised for its support of expanded fossil fuel infrastructure.\nHowever, unlike the US, which has proven to be especially vulnerable to antiscience disinformation (having now elected the most antiscience government in its 250-year history), Australia – after arriving at a crossroads four years ago – chose to take a different path. It elected a government that respects science and reason, even if it’s falling somewhat short of its commitments (eg lowering carbon emissions by 43% by 2030). The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, at least has recognised climate change as an existential threat, while Donald Trump has dismissed it as a hoax.\nThe dichotomy is equally stark when it comes to the Covid-19 pandemic. The numbers tell the story. Consider the state of Texas, where Peter lives and works. It has roughly the same population as the entire nation of Australia. Yet by September 2022, 90,000 Texans had died from Covid-19 (probably almost 40,000 of whom refused Covid immunisations after they were widely available). That’s almost four times the total number of Australian Covid-19 deaths.\nWhat explains the divergent path of these two western nations when it comes to the acceptance of science and science-based policymaking? A number of critical factors allowed Australians to elect a more climate-forward government despite total inundation with climate disinformation by the Murdoch media and other conservative news outlets. Certainly, the enduring legacy of the black summer was a factor. But so too were several key attributes of Australian elections: compulsory voting, absence of partisan districting and preferential or “ranked choice” voting.\nIn the US, partisan districting (“gerrymandering”), low voter turnout and a polarised two-party politics that squeezes out moderates have combined to yield electoral representation that is at odds with the actual views of the people. For example, a Gallup poll from last year found that 61% of US adults were concerned about the climate crisis. Yet US policies are currently set by a party that denies the basic existence of climate change.\nWhile there is a modest move in some states towards ranked choice voting, substantial changes in the American electoral system, such as compulsory voting, are unlikely to happen in the near term. A more viable way forward involves attacking the problem at its source: the well-organised and financed antiscience disinformation machine.\nIn April 2021, Mike was among a number of witnesses, including former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who spoke out against the Murdoch disinformation machine during an Australian Senate media diversity inquiry. Later that year, Labor and Greens called for an official inquiry into the “dangerous monopoly” of the Murdoch media empire. Biennial assessments monitoring media diversity are now under way, with the first report issued earlier this year.\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation also took on the Murdoch empire, re-broadcasting a two-part documentary series Fox and the Big Lie over the vociferous objections of the Murdochs.\nAs we detail in our book Science Under Siege, no media entity has done more to spread climate and Covid-19 antiscience disinformation than Fox News. Much as they have paid the price for their promotion of lies regarding the 2020 election and voting machines, it’s time for outfits that attack science and scientists to pay the price for the threat they pose to human civilisation.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Science is under siege.\nOn Friday evening, the White House released an executive order called Restoring Gold Standard Science. At face value, this order promises a commitment to federally funded research that is “transparent, rigorous, and impactful” and policy that is informed by “the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available”. But hidden beneath the scientific rhetoric is a plan that would destroy scientific independence in the US by giving political appointees the latitude to dismiss entire bodies of research and punish researchers who fail to fall in line with the current administration’s objectives. In other words: this is Fool’s-Gold Standard Science.\nAccording to the order, “Gold Standard Science means science conducted in a manner that is:\n(i) reproducible;\n(ii) transparent;\n(iii) communicative of error and uncertainty;\n(iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary;\n(v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions;\n(vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses;\n(vii) subject to unbiased peer review;\n(viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and\n(ix) without conflicts of interest.”\nThe order mimics the language of an active reform movement in science to increase rigor and transparency of research – a movement commonly called the open science movement, to which some of us are contributors. Science is, by nature, a continuous work in progress, constantly self-scrutinized and always looking for opportunities to improve. We should all be able to celebrate any administration’s investment in improving the openness, integrity and reproducibility of research.\nBut, with this executive order, we cannot.\nInstead of being about open science, it grants administration-aligned political appointees the power to designate any research as scientific misconduct based on their own “judgment” and includes the power to punish the scientists involved accordingly; this would weaponize government counter to the public interest.\nThe consequences of state-dictated science can be catastrophic. When Trofim Lysenko, a researcher who denied the reality of genetic inheritance and natural selection, won favor with Joseph Stalin and took control of agriculture in the Soviet Union, thousands of scientists who disagreed with him were fired, imprisoned or killed. His disastrous agricultural prescriptions ultimately led to famines that killed millions in the USSR and in China.\nScience does not proceed by sequentially establishing unassailable conclusions, but rather by steadily accumulating numerous lines of evidence, scrutinizing weaknesses, and pursuing additional evidence. Almost any study, any source of evidence, any conclusion, falls short of meeting every aspect of the White House’s list of best practices. This has nothing to do with laziness, let alone misconduct by individual scientists; it’s simply a consequence of the fact that science is difficult. Scientists constantly grapple with uncertainty, and nevertheless can ultimately arrive at robust, valid conclusions, such as the fact that vaccines do not cause autism, and that the burning of fossil fuels is warming the planet and wreaking havoc on our climate.\nUnder the terms of the executive order, political appointees loyal to the president can willfully find justification to label any research finding as scientific misconduct, and then penalize the researchers involved accordingly. This administration has already appropriated the language of open science to assert control over and deal heavy blows to the scientific ecosystem of the United States – including cancelling thousands of active research grants in climate science, misinformation and disinformation, vaccines, mental health, women’s health, LGBTQ+ health and stem education. Calls to “revisit” decades of work that establish vaccine safety beyond a shadow of a doubt “because the only way you can get good science is through replication”, and demands for unethical vaccine clinical trial practices and additional data, further echo the bad-faith adoption of open science language.\nTrump has also advanced a congressional budget calling for massive cuts to federal spending on research and development and levied significant retaliation against universities that have not fallen in line with his demands. He has gone so far as to propose a rule change by the office of personnel management that would install policy police at all levels of federal agencies, converting thousands of employees into presidential appointees who can be summarily fired without due process for any arbitrary political reason. This new executive order raises the concern that many of our best scientists would be targeted in Lysenkoist purges. Meanwhile, the threat of such actions is already having a chilling effect on all scientists.\nScience is the most important long-term investment for humanity. Interference in the scientific process by political arbiters stifles scientists’ freedom of speech and thought. Science depends on unfettered speech – free and continuous discussion of data and ideas. We, like the rest of the scientific community, aspire to achieve greater openness, integrity and reproducibility of research to accelerate discovery, advance treatments and foster solutions to meet society’s greatest challenges. Meeting that objective will not occur by centralizing power over science and scientists according to the whims of any political administration. We see this executive order for what it is: an attempt to sell the US’s future for pyrite.\n-\nColette Delawalla is a PhD candidate at Emory University and executive director of Stand Up for Science.

    "raw_text": "I was excited when the ABC asked me to be a panellist on a special bushfires edition of Q&A, the season opener for the Monday night program here in Australia.\nBut as the event grew nearer trepidation grew as well. Foreshadowing the trouble that might lie ahead, the ABC had to move the event not once but twice, from the initial site of Bega on the south coast, because of imminent fire danger.\nIt finally settled instead on Canberra, another location under grave bushfire threat. Out of the frying pan into the fire.\nBut my concerns went deeper. The bushfires have become highly contentious and reaction to them is partisan. Some people raised concerns on social media that two Coalition politicians and no Greens or Labor representatives had been invited on to the panel and that one of the panellists, the Liberal senator Jim Molan, was a denier of human-induced climate change (with a controversial record).\nThe bushfire special turned out well, overall, in my view. Hamish Macdonald, the new host, demonstrated his skills as a moderator, adroitly pressing the pollies to give forthright answers when they were evasive, while doing his best to be fair and nonpartisan in the presence of an audience who had a definite collective point of view.\nMacdonald pushed Molan to explain why he rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus that the climate change behind the unprecedented heat and drought is human-caused. That led to the most memorable exchange from the evening, with Molan shockingly confessing, live on air, that he is “not relying on evidence” for his dismissive views.\nMolan repeatedly insisted that he has tried to keep “an open mind” about the science. At that point I found it necessary to appropriate the aphorism that “you should keep an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out”. My intention was to use humour to make a more serious point, ie that while scepticism is a good thing, it doesn’t justify the indiscriminate rejection of well-established science.\nThe senator attempted to dismiss that critique as “name calling” and Hamish drilled down on this further, suggesting there’s a groundswell of support among “quiet Australians” for Molan’s views: “Clearly there are a lot of Australians that are happy with the policy settings that may agree with Jim Molan’s scepticism, open-mindedness, about the science.” He posed to me the question: “Are you saying to all of them that their brains have fallen out?”\nI tried to respond but was cut off before I could finish. I would have said with regard to Australians who voted in favour of the Liberal-National Coalition, their brains of course have not fallen out. But they have been washed – by Murdoch’s media empire, which has been wielded here in Australia and elsewhere as a weapon to discredit the science of climate change and to attack, smear and ultimately defeat prime ministers such as Kevin Rudd, Julia Gillard and even the Coalition’s Malcolm Turnbull, who supported action on climate.\nDespite the all-out assault by News Corp, a substantial majority of Australians not only believe that Australia should be “doing more” to address climate change, they believe that Australia should in fact be a “global leader” in the effort to reduce carbon emissions. That’s a pretty clear rebuke of the Morrison government’s policy of climate inaction.\nThe final question of the evening came from Sam, who cited the unprecedented weather extremes – fire, smoke, heat, dust, hale and drought – and asked whether his two-year-old son and nine-month-old daughter “can still share the carefree, healthy childhood that I had”.\nI would have pointed out that there is still time to preserve that future if we act now on climate, but that opportunity is slipping away. And that opportunity slipped away too, for I wasn’t given a chance to answer the question – and this crucial point was never made.\nWhile I understand the ABC felt it needed representation from Coalition politicians to meet their nonpartisan remit, they didn’t need to invite on a climate change denier any more than they need to invite on a flat-earther or an anti-vaxxer. There aren’t “two sides” when it comes to these issues – there is only the side of science.\nAnd while I would be lying if I said I don’t relish an opportunity to take climate deniers to task now and then, I also recognise that the time that was spent debating whether climate change – and the calamity that Australia is suffering as a consequence – is human-caused is time we could have spent providing Sam the sort of answer that he and his family deserve.\nQ&A will be doing another segment on the climate emergency next Monday. I hope it considers the makeup and format of this next panel discussion. I urge to provide viewers with a fact-based conversation about the climate crisis and prospects for addressing it.\nIts audience, and the good people of Australia, deserve it.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "I departed Australia three years ago, cutting my sabbatical short as Covid-19 spread and lockdowns ensued. I had just lived through Black Summer, a climate change-fueled disaster marked by unprecedented heat, withering drought and destructive and deadly bushfires. Though I had come to Australia to research the impacts of climate change on extreme weather events, it instead became my lived experience.\nThe governing Coalition had left a trail of death and destruction, both figuratively and literally. Thousands of homes were destroyed, dozens of lives lost, 24 million hectares burned, and Australia was shunned from an international climate summit over the then prime minister Scott Morrison’s climate intransigence. Meanwhile, the rightwing Murdoch media machine continued to spew climate disinformation, cynically blaming the devastation on arson and “back-burning”. Things appeared pretty bleak. Yet at the same time, I sensed that something had changed.\nThere was fiercer-than-usual pushback against the Murdoch disinformation campaign. The media narrative had shifted from questioning to highlighting the role climate change was playing in the unfolding crisis. I had numerous opportunities during my brief sojourn to help the public connect the dots.\nBut denial was not dead. My media appearances on ABC’s Q&A and 60 Minutes featured tussles with climate-denying politicians, including former Liberal party senator Jim Molan and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce. A year later I would encounter more of the same. I was testifying remotely at an Australian Senate media diversity inquiry about the role of the Murdoch media in promoting climate denial and delay in Australia. Queensland Liberal party senator Gerard Rennick confronted me with what he purported (without any context or sourcing) to be conflicting data from different climate reports. We were somehow supposed to believe that this “gotcha” invalidated all of climate science. He was reprimanded by the chair for his transparent effort to try to deflect the conversation from the topic at hand.\nOne year later, Rennick would be widely mocked for insisting to CSIRO head Larry Marshall, as he testified in a Senate committee hearing on economics legislation, that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics somehow invalidates global climate models. Having done graduate studies in both theoretical physics and climate science I can assure the reader that this is laughably absurd.\nAnd this is where we intersect the current timeline. This past week I exchanged words once again with Rennick. He had posted a clip of his exchange with Marshall on Twitter, insisting – quite nonsensically – that CO2 cannot warm the atmosphere because of “gravity” and “convection”. As supposed evidence he insisted that “the surface of the Earth is warmer than say the top of Mt Everest” because gravity “traps convection”. I politely explained to him that this is not the case.\nI informed him that the cooling of the atmosphere with altitude has nothing to do with “convection” but rather is a consequence of the balance of forces (pressure and gravity) and the conservation of energy (in fact, convection actually tends to the very opposite of what he’s claiming, tending to relieve the gravitational instability of having lighter air beneath heavier air by transporting heat upward, reducing the cooling with altitude). I even provided the lecture notes from my introductory college course on atmospheric science where I derive the relationship, inviting him to point out any errors he could identify.\nRennick chose not to do that. Instead, he insisted I was “making a fool” of myself, disparaged my scientific work and called me “champ”. At this point, I became a bit less charitable in my online engagement with him. Other participants have been similarly uncharitable. Among the links readers have supplied to put his tweet in a more accurate context is a climate explainer for young children from Nasa.\nWe should view these outbursts of denialism as rearguard skirmishes in what I’ve called “The New Climate War”. Climate denial is now a distraction, a sideshow intended to feed the conservative base with red meat while pacifying polluters. In a post-Black Summer world, where the reality and threat of the climate crisis have been laid bare, the true battle has moved on, from outright denial to deflection, distraction, and most of all, delay.\nThanks in part to delay tactics from the Liberal party, voters rejected them in the federal election of May 2022, and now in every state but Tasmania. In fact, the battle lines on climate have retreated so far now that the real fight isn’t over whether climate change is real or human caused, or even whether we should act. It’s now about what form action should take.\nNext month I return to Australia for a speaking tour after a three-year absence, and at a poignant moment indeed.\nThe climate crisis continues to deepen. In place of the unprecedented bushfires of 2020 we have the floods of 2022 and 2023. In place of scorched koalas in New South Wales we have village-dwelling crocodiles in Queensland. It’s a reminder of the shape-shifting nature of a crisis that promises ever-greater extremes at both ends of the scale. That’s the bad news.\nThe good news? After nearly a decade, Australia once again has a meaningful climate policy, after ongoing and somewhat heated negotiations between the Albanese government and the Greens. One can quibble over whether it goes far enough. But Greens leader Adam Bandt put it this way: “To everyone who is despairing about the future and wants real climate action, today you should have a spring in your step, because it shows we can take on the coal and gas corporations and win.”\nIs that enough? Climate action requires global cooperation. After substantial progress at Cop26 in Glasgow, the Cop27 meeting in Sharm El Sheikh late last year yielded minimal additional progress, failing to secure emissions reductions from the countries of the world that will keep warming of the planet below a catastrophic 1.5C. The recently-released UN IPCC Synthesis Report finds that this target is still within reach but it will require dramatic action in the years ahead.\nSo we find ourselves in an atmosphere of uncertainty, a bit like the erstwhile-ambivalent Rick Blaine and resistance fighter Victor Laszlo at the end of Casablanca. The fate of the second world war remained unclear, but there was an air of optimism. As Laszlo said to Rick, we say now to Australia: Welcome back to the fight.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "A new Trump administration report which attempts to justify a mass rollback of environmental regulations is chock-full of climate misinformation, experts say.\nOn Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposal to undo the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which allows the agency to limit planet-heating pollution from cars and trucks, power plants and other industrial sources. Hours later, the Department of Energy (DOE) published a 150-page report defending the proposal, claiming scientific concern about the climate crisis is overblown.\n“Climate change is a challenge – not a catastrophe,” wrote the energy secretary, Chris Wright, in the report’s introduction.\nThe esteemed climate scientist Michael Mann said the report was akin to the result he would expect “if you took a chatbot and you trained it on the top 10 fossil fuel industry-funded climate denier websites”.\nThe energy department published the report hours after the EPA announced a plan to roll back 2009’s “endangerment finding”, a seminal ruling that provided the legal basis for the agency to regulate climate-heating pollution under the Clean Air Act. If finalized, the move would topple virtually all US climate regulation.\nIn a Fox News interview, Wright claimed the report pushed back on the “cancel culture Orwellian squelching of science”. But Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard University and expert in climate misinformation, said its true purpose was to “justify what is a scientifically unjustifiable failure to regulate fossil fuels”.\n“Science is the basis for climate regulation, so now they are trying to replace legitimate science with pseudoscience,” she said.\n‘This is an agenda to promote fossil fuels’\nThe attack on the research underpinning the endangerment finding – which says greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare – comes as part of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil fuels, which are the primary cause of global warming.\n“This is an agenda to promote fossil fuels, not to protect public health and welfare or the environment,” said Rachel Cleetus, a director at climate and science non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists who was an author on the sixth US national climate assessment.\nAsked about scientists’ assertions that the new report is rife with misinformation, an energy department spokesperson, Ben Dietderich, said: “This report critically assesses many areas of ongoing scientific inquiry that are frequently assigned high levels of confidence – not by the scientists themselves but by the political bodies involved, such as the United Nations or previous presidential administrations.”\nBut the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produces what is widely considered the gold standard compendium of climate science, compiled by a huge multinational team of scientists, peer-reviewed and agreed to by every national government.\nThe latest IPCC synthesis report, released two years ago, was a vast undertaking involving 721 volunteer scientists around the world. It states that it is “unequivocal” that human activity has heated the planet, which has “led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people”.\nBy contrast, the Trump administration report was crafted by five handpicked scientists who are seen as having fringe or contrarian views by mainstream climate scientists, with no peer review. The experts behind the report have previously denied being climate deniers. The energy department did not respond to a question about the authors.\n“This report had five authors and was rushed over four months, and would not pass muster in any traditional scientific peer review process,” said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at the climate non-profit Berkeley Earth, who called the paper a “farce”.\nWright, the energy secretary, insisted he had not steered the report’s conclusions, while Judith Curry, one of the report authors, said in a blogpost she hoped the document would push climate science “away from alarmism and advocacy”.\n‘I’m embarrassed by this report’\nMainstream climate scientists, however, condemned the findings as distorted and inaccurate. “This is a report written by a couple of scientists who are outliers in their arguments for climate change,” said Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University. “This document does in no way depreciate the value of previous assessments, but rather just cherrypicks the literature to pretend to create a new review.”\nMahowald said the lack of peer review meant it was “obviously not as robust” as the IPCC report or the US government’s periodic national climate assessment, which the Trump administration recently took offline. The latest national climate assessment, compiled by a dozen government agencies and outside scientists in 2023, concluded that the “effects of human-caused climate change are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States”\n“If almost any other group of scientists had been chosen, the report would have been dramatically different,” Andrew Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A&M University, said of the new report. “The only way to get this report was to pick these authors.”\nHausfather agreed that the authors’ work “might represent their views but is not consistent with the broader scientific literature on climate change”. He was among the scientists whose work the authors cited.\nThe new paper includes a chart from a 2019 report which he led, claiming it demonstrates how climate models “consistently overestimated observations” of atmospheric carbon. But Hausfather’s research actually showed that climate models have performed well.\n“They appear to have discarded the whole paper as not fitting their narrative, and instead picked a single figure that was in the supplementary materials to cast doubt on models when the whole paper actually confirmed how well they have performed in the years after they were published,” he said. The energy department did not respond to a request for comment about Hausfather’s concerns.\nThat approach to research seems to underpin the entire paper, said Hausfather, who is also the climate research lead at tech company Stripe.\n“This is a general theme in the report; they cherrypick data points that suit their narrative and exclude the vast majority of the scientific literature that does not,” he said.\nDessler said scientists are obliged to engage with the full range of evidence, even if it contradicts their initial assumptions. Ignoring this principle “can rise to the level of scientific misconduct”, he said.\n“The report they produced should be thought of as a law brief from attorneys defending their client, carbon dioxide,” Dessler said. “Their goal is not to weigh the evidence fairly but to build the strongest possible case for CO2’s innocence.”\nThe lack of peer review in the administration’s report led to conclusions that deviated, sometimes wildly, from the scientific literature. Many of its claims are based on long-debunked research long promoted by climate deniers, said Mann.\n“It is shop worn, decades-old, discredited climate denier talking points, dressed up in the clothing of some sensible new set of revelations,” he said. “What’s different is that it has the imprimatur of the EPA and the federal government now.”\nThe report, for instance, claims that warming trends have been overstated, despite evidence to the contrary. It was published as extreme heat is affecting millions of Americans.\n“They’re literally trying to tell us not to believe what we see with our own two eyes … and instead buy into their denialist framing that rejects not just the science, but what is plainly evident if you look out your window,” said Mann.\nThe authors also write that ocean acidification is occurring “within the range of natural variability” and is beneficial for marine life despite indications that by the end of this century, the ocean’s acidic levels could reach the highest since 14m years ago, a time when a major extinction event was occurring.\nAnd the report references the apparent health of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which it says “has shown considerable growth in recent years”. The reef was recently hit by its sixth mass bleaching event since 2016, a devastating phenomenon for corals in which they whiten and sometimes die due to high sea temperatures. No widespread bleaching events were recorded on the reef before 1998.\nThe report is “tedious” and at times “truly wearisome”, according to Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University. Kopp recently worked on a paper showing how rising temperatures and drought will worsen crop yields, counter to the report’s claims that crops will flourish with extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n“Carbon dioxide fertilization is largely irrelevant to how increasingly extreme heat and intense drought will impact crop yields,” Kopp said. “As a former department of energy fellow, I’m embarrassed by this report.”"

    "raw_text": "After much Sturm und Drang, Australia’s prime minister Scott Morrison has finally jetted off to attend the global climate talks in Glasgow with a vague and hastily assembled commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nThe growing international pressure and voter concerns over the devastating climate impacts Australia has endured in recent years appear to have finally dragged the government kicking and screaming to this position, despite a rearguard action by the government’s Coalition partners, the National party, against any such commitment. However, last week Morrison triumphantly waved a pamphlet proclaiming his government’s commitment to net zero under the banner of the “Australian Way”.\nLong on promises and short on details, the government’s commitment relies upon the viability of dubious future technologies, most notably carbon capture at massive scale, rather than any mandated reduction in emissions, let alone a price or tax on emitted carbon. As Morrison said: “Our plan works with Australians to achieve this goal. Our plan enables them, it doesn’t legislate them, it doesn’t mandate them.”\nWhile business groups, including those representing the country’s coal industry like the Minerals Council of Australia, praised the announcement as providing certainty, overseas observers have noted this commitment is the weakest among developed nations attending the Glasgow talks, and lacks any change to the government’s existing emissions reductions targets of 26% to 28% by 2030 (half what other industrialised nations such as the US, the UK and the European Union have committed to). Indeed, recent analysis suggests Australia is at the back of the pack among developed nations in terms of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels.\nWhile this commitment, even if reluctant, to net zero emissions by 2050 is to be welcomed, in reality it needs to be seen within the broader context of the Australian government’s continued coddling of the fossil fuel industry. Australia is among the world’s largest fossil fuel exporters (ranking just behind Russia and Saudi Arabia) and the largest in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, making up 7% of global fossil fuel exports. After decades of government-sponsored expansion, Australia’s coal and gas industries make the country the fifth-largest miner of fossil fuel carbon in absolute terms (larger than India, Indonesia, Canada, Iraq and Iran). Added to that, domestic emissions are significant, ranking 14th globally, and on a per capita basis the highest in the OECD.\nThis fossil fuel addiction stems from the close support by government of the industry over decades, with considerable assistance from the Murdoch media empire, who have presented fossil fuel extraction and use as inherent to Australia’s national identity and economic wellbeing. While growing concerns over climate change have prompted attempts at policy reform (most notably the former Gillard Labor government’s introduction of carbon pricing legislation a decade ago), these moves have been strenuously opposed by the Coalition and the mining industry.\nHowever, as outright denial of climate change becomes untenable in the face of record-breaking droughts, fires, and floods, industry and its abettors in government and the conservative media have engaged in what one of us has termed the new climate war. This war on climate action involves an array of tactics that fall short of outright denial, but are nonetheless aimed at blocking, or at least slowing, the transition of fossil fuels.\nIn Australia, a chief tactic of the forces of climate inaction has been to call for a “measured response” which in no way constrains fossil fuel expansion. If Australia were to limit its coal exports, the inactivists argue, buyers would source coal from elsewhere (a variation of the “drug-dealer’s defence”). Or they assert that Australian coal helps bring developing nations out of “energy poverty” (a tagline developed by US coal giant Peabody Energy and promoted by climate inactivists). Coal is “good for humanity” they insist. Indeed, Morrison in a previous incarnation as the country’s treasurer in the hot summer of 2017 famously waved a lump of coal at opposition politicians on the floor of parliament, declaring: “This is coal … don’t be afraid!” Well, we should have been afraid. Very afraid. After all, look who is now prime minister.\nGiven the Coalition’s history of defending the dominance of fossil energy in Australia, what are we to make of their belated acceptance of the net zero agenda? Overall, it appears the song remains the same! The failure to commit to increased emissions reduction targets, as well as the recent disclosures that the Australian government has sought to water down a UN recommendation to phase out coal- and gas-fired power stations, and rejected a call to join a US and European-led pledge to cut methane emissions, and that the country’s energy minister will be spruiking the benefits of Australian gas investment at the Glasgow talks, all seem par for the course. While Morrison has swapped the lump of coal for a flashy pamphlet, there appears little substance to the government’s purported commitment to climate action.\nLike other nations and companies committed to a continuation of business-as-usual fossil fuel extraction and use, it appears the name of the game is delay and inaction. Unfortunately, the time for delay is well past and the window to avoid catastrophic climate disruption is rapidly closing. We can’t afford further inaction and obfuscation by the current Australian government.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Australia has been ranked last for climate action out of nearly 200 countries in a report assessing progress towards global sustainable development goals.\nThe Sustainable Development Report 2021, first reported by Renew Economy, scored Australia last out of 193 United Nations member countries for action taken to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.\nA database shows Australia received a score of just 10 out of 100 in an assessment of fossil fuel emissions, emissions associated with imports and exports, and policies for pricing carbon.\nSecond last was Brunei, which was ranked behind Qatar and Norway.\nRichie Merzian, a climate expert at the Australia Institute, said the result was unsurprising.\n“Australia has received similar rankings from other comparable studies, including the Climate Change Performance Index, which last year ranked Australia second last behind only Trump’s America,” he said.\n“The federal government has no climate and energy policy and instead has cherry-picked technologies, many of which support the fossil fuel industry.”\nThe report noted Australia had not committed to achieving netzero carbon emissions by 2050. Scott Morrison has instead signalled Australia wants to achieve carbon neutrality as soon as possible and “preferably” by 2050.\nThe most recent emissions data, released by the government in late May, showed Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions were at the lowest levels in 30 years as the coronavirus pandemic put a handbrake on fossil fuel burning in the transport sector and slowed economic activity.\nIn a statement at the time, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said those levels were despite “upward pressure from growth in exports and industry”.\nThe Sustainable Development Report tracks countries’ progress towards the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals, which include quality education, gender equality, wiping out poverty, creating sustainable cities and communities, and affordable and clean energy.\nAustralia ranked 35th overall, performing strongly on health and wellbeing, economic growth, education and clean water and sanitation.\nFor clean energy, Australia was listed as having “major challenges” but recorded a moderate improvement over the past 12 months.\nThe report says countries should not allow the Covid-19 pandemic to lead to a prolonged reversal in progress towards the goals.\n“International commitments, for instance towards climate neutrality, must be rapidly accompanied by transformative actions and investments,” the report says.\n“Large fiscal packages of major economies present an opportunity to foster a green, digital, and inclusive recovery.”"

    "raw_text": "Australia’s climate-heating emissions increased fractionally last year as pollution from fossil fuel power plants rose for the first time in a decade, and domestic air travel and use of diesel-powered cars and trucks hit record highs.\nThe jump in emissions was small – just 0.05% – due to falls in pollution from other sectors. But the direction was at odds with the Albanese government’s pledge to cut pollution to reach targets for 2030 and 2050.\nThe data was released on Friday, two days after the environment minister, Murray Watt, announced he planned to approve a 40-year life extension for one of Australia’s biggest fossil fuel developments – Woodside Energy’s North West Shelf liquified natural gas (LNG) processing facility in the Pilbara.\nBased on the Burrup peninsula, in Murujuga country, the North West Shelf is Australia’s third biggest industrial polluter, responsible for about 1.4% of the country’s annual climate pollution.\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has rejected concerns about the facility’s emissions continuing for decades after 2050, saying the national goal was “net zero, not zero”, implying ongoing fossil fuel use could be justified by using a contentious carbon offset scheme. His comments echoed language used in 2021 by the Coalition’s then emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, when defending climate policies under Scott Morrison.\nRising electricity use\nThe quarterly greenhouse gas inventory said the increase in national emissions last year may be short-lived, with preliminary data suggesting they fell in the first quarter this year.\nEmissions last year were estimated to be 446.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide, 0.2m tonnes higher than in 2023. The increase is largely due to pollution from electricity generation rising by 2.2%, reversing a 10-year trend. Australians used more electricity overall, and there was less hydro power available than usual during winter. Solar use was up, but the extra demand was otherwise met by more coal and gas.\nInitial data for the March quarter suggest the long-term trend of pollution from electricity falling should restart this year. This has been backed by a separate report by the Australian Energy Market Operator.\nAt the end of last year emissions from power generation was 23.7% lower than in 2005. Experts expect it to continue to fall as a government underwriting program announced in November 2023 supports an influx of new large-scale solar, wind and batteries.\nBut emissions from transport continue to surge as Australians fly more and burn more diesel in bigger cars and trucks. Pollution from the transport sector was up 1.9% last year. It has skyrocketed 20.8% since 2005.\nVehicle efficiency standards introduced last year require auto companies to reduce the average pollution from new cars each year, but they are expected to only gradually affect total transport emissions.\n‘More to do’\nGovernment officials estimated national pollution was 27% below 2005 levels, largely due to a change in the amount of carbon dioxide that is absorbed by the land and forests. The Albanese government has a legislated target of a 43% cut by 2030 and has promised a 2035 target later this year.\nThe climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, said Labor was on track to reach the 2030 target but there was “more to do” to get there.\n“Industrial emissions are now lower than they were during Covid-19, even as the economy has recovered,” he said. “We need to keep going, and ensuring we’re delivering downward pressure on emissions across the economy.”\nThe Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said Labor had failed two climate tests: pollution was going up, and it had approved the “climate-wrecking North West Shelf dirty gas extension”.\n“During the last term of parliament Labor approved over 30 new coal and gas projects and it doesn’t look like they’re slowing down any time soon,” she said.\nGlobal ‘LNG glut’\nAlbanese this week defended the North West Shelf extension by saying gas was needed along with batteries and pumped hydro storage to “firm” renewable energy generation in the electricity grid. The government’s target is that 82% of electricity will come from renewable energy by 2030. “You can’t have renewables unless you have firming capacity. Simple as that,” Albanese said. “You don’t change a transition through warm thoughts.”\nAsked about the WA development, Albanese said the Tomago aluminium smelter in New South Wales’ Hunter Valley relied on gas to firm renewable energy, and WA’s main electricity grid would become more reliant on gas as the state closed its remaining coal-fired power plants.\nThe prime minister did not say how much gas from the facility was destined to be used in Australia. According to analysis of recent data, the overwhelming bulk of the gas produced on the North West Shelf and elsewhere in WA – 81% – was exported. Another 7% was used by the gas industry as part of the production process. About 8% was used for gas-fired electricity generation in WA. None was used at Tomago.\nCritics have challenged the economic and climate basis for a decades-long extension of the processing facility’s life. Alex Hillman, from the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility and a former Woodside Energy climate change adviser, said analysts from the International Energy Agency had projected the world was heading for an “LNG glut” later this decade.\n“There is no commercial justification to add further LNG supply, and there is certainly no climate justification,” he said. “Whilst there is major flooding in New South Wales and a major drought in South Australia, these are emissions that are going to cause Australians and investment portfolios further harm as the physical impacts of climate change increase.”\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "The winters of the early 1970s were very cold and snowy in the northeastern United States where I grew up – as elsewhere around the US and Europe. I remember snowfalls that came up to my chin (though, of course, I was only a few feet tall back then). We now call those “old-fashioned winters”, precisely because they have grown so rare as a consequence of – yes – global warming.\nIf you’re younger than I am (I became a demi-centenarian three years ago), those winters are likely to be outside the range of your experience. And so it may seem plausible to you that cold snaps, that in reality simply reflect the sort of weather that was commonplace just decades ago, might constitute “record” or “unprecedented” cold.\nSuch a myopic view of weather extremes can be exploited by those who look to cast doubt on the overwhelming scientific consensus behind human-caused climate change. Very much in that vein, Donald Trump recently asserted in a tweet about the cold spell in the midwest that “windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees, the coldest ever recorded”. He added: “What the hell is going on with Global Waming [sic]? Please come back fast, we need you!”\nNeglect, for the moment, that “global waming” isn’t a thing and that, as we have come to expect, almost none of the claims in Trump’s tweet are true – the coldest wind-chill temperatures recorded for the midwest are close to minus 70F (minus 57C), and for the US overall below minus 100F (minus 73C). Might he have a point?\nFor example, if we were seeing more frequent cold extremes, would this contradict the theory of human-caused global warming? No. Scientists increasingly think that climate change may cause a more frequent breakdown of the “polar vortex” of the northern hemisphere (the tight band of winds in the upper atmosphere that, typically, confine the cold North Pole air masses to the Arctic, loosely associated with the jet stream). The amplified warming of the Arctic caused by the melting of sea ice reduces the temperature contrast between the equator and pole. It is that contrast that maintains the polar vortex and jet stream. As the vortex breaks down, the jet stream slows and exhibits broader north-south wiggles, just as a river crossing almost level territory exhibits broad meanders as it snakes its way to the coastline.\nThat makes it easier for pieces of the cold Arctic air masses to break off and wobble down into middle-latitude continental regions such as North America and Europe, precisely what happened with the recent cold air outbreak in the US. But let’s return to the other first question: are we seeing an increase in record cold? So far, in the first month of 2019, two all-time cold records were set – in towns in Illinois. Meanwhile, there have been 35 all-time records for heat (many of them set in the extreme summer heatwave that is baking Australia and scorching cities such as Adelaide). That’s a ratio of 18 hot records to each cold record.\nIn the absence of planetary warming, that ratio should be one to one. Maybe, you say, it’s a fluke. After all, it’s only one month of data. But the ratio of warm to cold records is roughly two to one for the past decade.\nWe can now go a step further, “attributing” record warm spells to global warming by employing climate models to quantify the incidence of extreme events, both with and without the effect of human-caused greenhouse warming. The extreme European heatwave last summer was, according to one such estimate, made twice as likely by human-caused climate change. (In reality, this is probably an underestimate because the models do not capture some of the effects of a slowing jet stream analysed in some of my own recent research). So we’re seeing a trend toward more record heat, not record cold. And, even if we were seeing an increase in cold winter outbreaks in certain parts of the US and Europe, it wouldn’t necessarily contradict the case for climate change – it might even be symptomatic of it, associated with the breakdown in the polar vortex.\nLet us return to Trump’s tweet, for it does not stand in isolation. It is part of a several-years-old pattern of denying the basic scientific evidence for human-caused climate change. Trump is plainly not the “genius” he has claimed to be, but he knows that climate change is real. We know this because he cited it as a reason to be granted a special dispensation to build a wall – a wall to protect his golf course in Ireland from the damaging effects of a rise in sea level.\nSo, if it’s not due to ignorance, what is responsible for Trump’s continued climate-change denial? Could it be the same thing responsible for him outsourcing his energy and environmental policy to fossil fuel interests? Could it have something to do with Russian influence that some have suggested helped get him elected?\nWe may have some answers to these questions when special counsel Robert Mueller completes his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election.\nIn any case, Trump’s repeated dismissive comments about human-caused climate change are an example of what I have referred to as “the weaponisation of ignorance”. The ignorance in this case isn’t Trump’s. He appears to know better. It’s the electorate’s.\nOnly with an ill-informed citizenry could you plausibly dismiss the consensus of the world’s scientists based upon a single cold spell. Trump and, more to the point, the fossil fuel interests whose bidding he is doing have weaponised the public’s poor understanding of science.\nThe great Carl Sagan presaged this very scenario in his classic work The Demon-Haunted World. Sagan feared a descent into ignorance and expressed his apprehension of a future in which “no one representing the public interest can even grasp the issues”.\nHe worried about the emergence of a citizenry that is unable to differentiate between “what feels good and what’s true” and is therefore vulnerable to pseudo science and anti-science.\nWith the election of Donald Trump, have we finally arrived in the future that Sagan so feared? And if so, is there any escape from it? That remains to be seen."

    "raw_text": "Australia stands at a crossroads, once more. While most of the world has started down a path toward building a cleaner, safer energy and climate future, the Australian government remains stuck in place.\nTo an outside observer like myself, Australia’s approach is reminiscent of the what we saw several years ago with other intransigent countries – hesitant, stubbornly clinging to outmoded energy systems and unwilling to embrace the necessary and inevitable transition away from fossil fuels.\nThe difference is now, the rest of the world is moving swiftly down the path of a renewable energy transformation, while Australia’s “leaders” are still bickering about which direction the country should go.\nBut despite the political rhetoric, the notion that Australia can continue on its current trajectory as the world’s biggest exporter of coal and gas, and one of the top contributors to carbon pollution, while also securing a safe, flourishing future for its populace is false. The two goals are as incompatible as oil and water.\nIt is now widely accepted that a global future powered by fossil fuels cannot safely sustain human civilization. Burning coal, oil and gas for electricity, transportation and manufacturing has been the primary driver of the climate crisis, a crisis that now threatens to engulf Australia as well as the rest of the world.\nAs a climate scientist who has spent decades studying the impact of carbon emissions from the burning of coal, oil and gas, the case against fossil fuels is clear. We must, with utmost urgency, cease using these destructive energy sources and make the shift to a cleaner, greener energy economy.\nAs I argue in The New Climate War, the most important action we must take is at the systemic level. We must transform our energy infrastructure from polluting fossil fuels to renewables with urgency and dispatch.\nA report from Greenpeace Australia Pacific released this week lays out the case against fossil fuels in stark detail. It describes how burning fossil fuels – coal, oil and gas – has created climate calamity, marked by the extreme heat, devastating floods, inundated coastlines and super-charged bushfires with which Australians are sadly now all too familiar.\nThese adverse climate impacts, driven by the fossil fuel industry and those who aid and abet it, are wreaking havoc on public health systems. People are dying from toxic air from climate-accelerated bushfires and noxious coal-burning power stations.\nGroundwater supplies, so precious and scarce in a famously arid land like Australia, are being contaminated by the rapacious gas industry. Food security is at risk as farmers struggle to adapt to a rapidly warming climate.\nAs much as some Australian politicians may like to talk about coal and gas being foundational to Australia’s economy, it has become increasingly clear that it will in fact be its downfall. As Greenpeace’s report (and numerous reports before it) make clear, Australia is a country on the frontlines of the climate crisis. The cost of damage wreaked by the extraction and burning of fossil fuels already outweighs any short-term economic gains to be made by exploiting these toxic resources. This will become ever more true if Australia proceeds headlong down the treacherous fossil fuel path.\nAs a country blessed with abundant sun, wind and open space, Australia has so much to gain from embracing clean climate solutions – and so much to lose by a failure to do so. And yet the Australian government has repeatedly failed to act to protect its people from the greed of the fossil fuel industry, whose insidious influence can be seen in its short-sighted decision-making.\nThe prime minister, Scott Morrison, dissembles on the world stage at a succession of international conferences where Australia’s do-nothing climate approach is beginning to stick out like the proverbial sore thumb.\nOnly last week Unesco proposed to downgrade the status of the Great Barrier Reef to “world heritage in danger” due to the mass bleaching of coral caused by a rapidly warming ocean, leaving people around the world asking why the Australian government is failing in its duty to preserve this magnificent, irreplaceable natural wonder it has been entrusted to steward.\nMeanwhile, history seems to be repeating itself in Australian domestic politics as Barnaby Joyce, an individual with whom I exchanged heated words at the height of the Australian 2019-20 bushfires, once again takes the reins as deputy prime minister, threatening to drag the country’s climate policy backward further still.\nThis theatre-show, turning crucial climate progress into a divisive tool for political point-scoring, does not serve the interests of the Australian people, and your unique continent with the awesome diversity of life and culture it sustains. The clock is ticking but it’s not too late for Australia to step up and do its part in tackling the global climate challenge that faces us all.\nAustralia must choose between two paths as it faces its future. One leads to suffering and ruin. The other leads to a safe and vital future. But to pass through the gate it must leave fossil fuels behind. The choice is yours, mates.\n-\nMichael E Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University.

    "raw_text": "Climate was not the only issue in the Australian election – it never is – but it was the dominating policy issue and all of the winners – Labor, the Greens (who won two more seats in the lower house) and the teal independents – were campaigning for stronger action and higher targets.\nFor the first time in a long time, climate action had a good election. It’s instructive to ask why. Certainly, the enduring legacy of the “black summer” was part of it. But we must not understate the role that the rise of the teal independents – and the tectonic shift in Australian politics that it represents – played here.\nThe Labor party government, led by Anthony Albanese, is committed to a 43% reduction in emissions by 2030 (from 2005 levels). As prime minister, one of the co-authors of this piece, Malcolm Turnbull, committed to a target of 26-28% at Paris in 2015, in the expectation that the target would be increased. His successor Scott Morrison’s refusal to do so at the 2020 Glasgow COP was bitterly resented by Australia’s closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom.\nIt seems hard to believe today but there was a time when both major parties agreed on establishing an emissions trading scheme (ETS). It was first proposed by prime minister John Howard in 2006 and the first piece of legislation to set it up was introduced by Turnbull as environment minister the following year.\nAt the 2007 election Howard and Labor leader Kevin Rudd had a lot of things to argue about, but an ETS was not one of them.\nAfter the election, Rudd retained the same team of public servants who had been working on the ETS under Howard and they produced what Rudd called a carbon pollution reduction scheme (CPRS).\nBy this time Turnbull was Liberal leader and Opposition leader. His goal was to maintain the Howard-era policy in favour of an ETS and negotiate with Rudd on the terms of it.\nHowever a growing insurgency on the right of the Liberal and National parties, supported by the coal industry and the Murdoch media, resulted in a party room coup that saw Turnbull lose the leadership to Tony Abbott, who then went on to wage a shamefully dishonest, but highly effective, campaign against the CPRS. (There is some poetic justice in the fact that Abbott would later lose his seat to one of the leading independent climate champions, Zali Steggall.)\nNow, 13 years and five prime ministers later, any form of ETS has become a political third rail and it does not feature anywhere in Labor’s climate policies.\nDuring the last election Morrison sought to present Labor’s modest 2030 targets as dangerous economy wreckers and he was backed up by the Murdoch media with a campaign that exceeded any before it.\nIf you saw the election as being one where a climate laggard government was replaced by another with a more activist approach, you would miss the real story.\nSure, Labor won, we have a new prime minister and that will enable Australia – the only developed country not to increase its 2030 target at Glasgow – to rejoin the global effort to cut emissions with credibility.\nIn a parliamentary system like Australia, winning government means winning the support of a majority of members in the House of Representatives or its equivalent. So typically a political party will have electorates in which its members have large majorities and others where the majorities are slender – a few percent. Government is won or lost in these marginal seats, they can be lost at one election and won back at another.\nThat means the bedrock of a political party’s parliamentary power lies in its safest seats – the ones they can always rely on winning.\nBut in this latest election, the “teal” independents, so called for the colour of their campaign livery, succeeded in winning six of the Liberal party’s safest seats, including Turnbull’s old electorate of Wentworth, which he had held with a 67% majority.\nTogether with three others won in earlier elections, this meant that nine of the Liberal party’s safest, wealthiest seats were now held by independents, all women, who had persuaded thousands of lifetime Liberal voters to defect.\nIn Australia, once an independent wins a seat they are generally very hard to dislodge.\nWhat lessons does all of this have for the fraught climate policy debate for the world’s largest cumulative carbon polluter, the United States?\nHow, for example, did Australia manage to defeat the Murdoch climate disinformation machine, which has so effectively waged war on climate policy in the US for years? Murdoch outlets such as Fox News and the Wall Street Journal editorial pages have almost single-handedly created the asymmetric polarisation of the American political right that today serves as such a formidable obstacle to meaningful action on climate.\nMurdoch has an even greater stranglehold on the Australian media. Yet several features of Australia’s electoral system made it resistant to Murdoch’s influence. The boundaries of parliamentary districts are set by an independent electoral commission and have been for generations – there are no gerrymanders. Voting is compulsory and participation is always well over 90%.\nBoth policy goals are laudable, but they’re an uphill battle in the US, likely to be fought out bitterly along red state/blue state boundaries.\nFinally, and most importantly, though, Australia has preferential or ranked choice voting, where electors have to write a number against each candidate’s name indicating the order in which they are preferred. Right now, ranked choice voting is the law in only two US states, but interestingly, they aren’t blue states: they’re purple (Maine) and deep red (Alaska). This may explain why the two Republican Senators from those States – Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins – are more centrist than most of their Trump-dominated caucus.\nA growing number of cities and municipalities have implemented ranked choice, which experiences levels of bipartisan support that are unusual in today’s hyperpartisan American politics. And 29 states are now considering implementing it.\nThe teal independents in Australia were running against Liberal incumbents, most of whom would normally get a first-preference vote of 50% or more. However if they could take a substantial part of that and get the incumbent’s primary vote down to 40% or less, and if they ran second, they would probably win with the benefit of Labor and Green preferences. And this is more or less what happened.\nSo a big tent political party was captured by the political right and on several issues, especially climate, and dragged to a position that did not reflect the values of many of its lifetime voters. But the flexibility of preferential voting meant that an independent could come through the middle, offering voters policies and personalities that they wanted.\nPeople power trumped Murdoch. Perhaps it can do so in the US.\nAmericans have nothing to lose and everything to gain, including a return, like Australia, to a position of global leadership on climate\nMichael E Mann is distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University.

    "raw_text": "The Trump administration is stripping away support for scientific research in the US and overseas that contains a word it finds particularly inconvenient: “climate.”\nThe US government is withdrawing grants and other support for research that even references the climate crisis, academics have said, amid Donald Trump’s blitzkrieg upon environmental regulations and clean-energy development.\nTrump, who has said that the climate crisis is a “giant hoax”, has already stripped mentions of climate change and global heating from government websites and ordered a halt to programs that reference diversity, equity and inclusion. A widespread funding freeze for federally backed scientific work also has been imposed, throwing the US scientific community into chaos.\nResearchers said work mentioning climate is being particularly targeted. One environmental scientist working in the western US who did not want to be named said their previously awarded grant from the Department of Transportation for climate-adaption research had been withdrawn, until they retitled it to remove the word “climate”.\n“I still have the grant because I changed the title,” the scientist said. “I was told that I needed to do so before the title of the grant was published on the US DoT [Department of Transportation] website in order to keep it. The explanation was that the priorities of the current administration don’t include climate change and other topics considered ‘woke’.”\nThe researcher said they were “shocked because the grant was already awarded and I would have risked losing it. I’m very concerned about science being politically influenced. If researchers can’t use certain words, it’s likely that some science will be biased.”\nReferences to climate are being scrubbed elsewhere, too. Course materials at the National Disaster Preparedness Training Center at the University of Hawaii will delete mentions of “climate change”, leaked emails seen by the Guardian show. The alterations, at the behest of the Trump administration, affect about a dozen different course materials.\n“Specifically, references to ‘climate change’ and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) have been removed or revised to align with the new priorities,” an administrator at the center wrote. “Please exercise caution when referencing these topics during instruction.”\nThe administration’s animus towards climate research has even extended overseas via the US’s Fulbright exchange program, which offers about 8,000 grants a year to American and foreign teachers and scholars.\nKaarle Hämeri, chancellor of the University of Helsinki in Finland, said the descriptions for Fulbright grants had been changed to remove or alter the words “climate change”, as well as “equitable society”, “inclusive societies” and “women in society”.\nHämeri said that one grant to his university had already been withdrawn as a result of changes he said were also being imposed across other countries involved in the Fulbright program. Fulbright and the US state department were asked about the extent of the wording bans.\n“I understand that these actions are due to changed priorities in US government,” said Hämeri. “It will harm research in several important fields, especially as in many cases the US researchers are among the best in their field.”\nAt the National Science Foundation (NSF), a $9bn federal agency that supports research in science and engineering, teams have been combing through active projects looking for dozens of words, including “women”, “biased” and “equality” that may violate Trump’s ban on certain grants.\nThe NSF, which has just fired about 10% of its workforce, did not respond to questions over whether climate is also on the banned list. Regardless, grants supporting an array of scientific work have been frozen amid this zealous mission to install a newspeak among scientists, despite a court order demanding the freeze be reversed.\n“[The] NSF is working expeditiously to conduct a comprehensive review of our projects, programs and activities to be compliant with the existing executive orders,” a foundation spokesperson said.\nThe freeze on grants has upended scientific work across federal agencies, hospitals and universities, placing the future of hundreds of millions of dollars’ of research into question.\n“The people most vulnerable in our society in terms of health and public safety are now even further at risk,” said Jennifer Jones, director of the center for science and democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n“This administration doesn’t have a plan to advance science, they have a plan to remove obstacles for the oil and gas industry. They want to return to an era where kids have polio, rivers are on fire and cities are blanketed by pollution.”\nJones said that the US government may be moving in the direction of Florida, where Republicans banned mention of climate change in state laws. “I live in a state where we are under threat more than ever from climate change but state employees can’t mention it,” she said. “This administration wants scientists to feel threatened. We’ve seen this before but Trump is doing it at an unprecedented scale now.”\nThe attack upon science “feels very personal right now” and may deter a new generation of young scientists from entering their areas of research, according to Joanne Carney, chief government affairs officer at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n“We could see a reduction in whole fields of scientific research that will slow down our ability to understand the natural world and craft policies to protect society and national security,” Carney said.\n“We’re concerned about the signal this is sending out to any young student interest in Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] who might not think they can see a future in the US,” she said. “We need greater investment in science and technology to be a global leader at this moment. Our adversaries will be very happy with this.”"

    "raw_text": "Labor and the Greens have recommended a judicial inquiry with the powers of a royal commission into media diversity, ownership and regulation.\nThe majority report from the long-running Senate inquiry into media diversity found it was “clear that the current regulatory framework is not fit for purpose and significant changes are required”.\n“A judicial inquiry would have the capacity for a more comprehensive investigation, including compelling witnesses to give evidence, than can be undertaken by a parliamentary committee,” the report, which was tabled on Thursday, stated.\n“Such an inquiry would also be conducted at arm’s length of all politicians to allow an independent investigation into media regulation and ownership.”\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young won support to set up the Senate inquiry a year ago following the popularity of Kevin Rudd’s petition for a royal commission into Murdoch media.\nThe former Labor prime minister’s petition for a royal commission into the need for a strong and diverse media was supported by more than 500,000 people.\nThe federal opposition’s media spokesperson, Michelle Rowland, told Sky News Australia on Thursday that Labor would not seek a judicial inquiry because it was not ALP policy.\n“With all due respect to the Senate, it performs its functions and undertakes its inquiries and makes its recommendations as it sees fit,” she said. “But I can tell you clearly that this is not Labor party policy.”\nRudd subsequently criticised Rowland on ABC TV by suggesting she was too “close” to Murdoch.\nThe upper house committee was told media regulation was not effective and inconsistent governance arrangements and standards across platforms made it unworkable. TV is governed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, a government agency, while print and digital news are overseen by the Australian Press Council, a self-regulated industry body.\n“Evidence to the committee testified to the inability of existing regulators to ensure that standards of fairness and accuracy are maintained, and to prevent the spread of misinformation,” the majority report from Labor and the Greens said.\nHanson-Young said the report found the call for a judicial inquiry from the more than half a million Australians who signed the petition was warranted.\n“The majority of the committee which undertook this 13-month-long inquiry has recommended the establishment of a judicial inquiry with the powers and weight of a royal commission into the state of media diversity and dominance in Australia,” Hanson-Young said. “This is a move the parliament itself can make.”\nA judicial inquiry could be set up without the support of the government but for a bill to pass the House of Representatives, a member of the government would need to cross the floor.\nHanson-Young said: “The evidence that the Murdoch media empire is indeed a dangerous monopoly was heard loud and clear. From climate-denialism to gendered, partisan attacks, and providing a platform for racism and for Covid disinformation, the impact of both concentration of media ownership and a failing regulatory system was obvious.”\n“Throughout the inquiry, we heard about the many Australian journalists that produce high-quality, in-depth reporting with integrity and professionalism. It is those hard-working journalists that are being let down by a broken regulatory system and corporate culture inside news organisations that allows poor behaviour to flourish,” the Greens senator said.\nMurdoch’s global chief executive, Robert Thomson, told the Senate inquiry the idea that Rupert Murdoch influenced Australian elections was a “myth” and far removed from the behaviour of “the real Rupert”.\nThomson rejected a suggestion by Hanson-Young that the chairman and chief executive of News Corp had a hand in directing his newspaper editors on which party should win.\n“Senator, the philosophy is around ideas,” Thomson told the media diversity inquiry via video conference from New York. “I have to say there is Murdoch the myth ... and the real Rupert.”\nIn earlier evidence, Sky News Australia denied broadcasting Covid misinformation, telling the hearing that YouTube’s removal of 23 of the broadcaster’s videos was “totalitarian” and lacking in transparency.\nThe Sky News chief executive officer, Paul Whittaker, said it “now appears commonplace to discredit any debate on contentious issues as ‘misinformation’” and vigorously defended Sky’s right to present a range of views on treatments such as ivermectin.\nIn a dissenting report, Liberal senator Andrew Bragg called the report a “shameless political stunt which should not be taken seriously”.\n“The committee has called for this inquiry two weeks after the Senate collapsed an inquiry into the ABC complaints process,” Bragg said. “The report recommends private media organisations should be subjected to the intrusions of a judicial inquiry. At the same time, the ABC should not be subjected to Senate scrutiny. That is absurd.”\nBragg was behind the push for a complaints inquiry which was branded “political interference” by the ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, and voted down by Labor and the Greens in the Senate.\nRudd, who is chair of the recently launched lobby group Australians for a Murdoch Royal Commission, said Thursday’s report vindicated the concerns of the people who signed the petition.\n“This wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for the ordinary Australians doing what politicians haven’t had the courage for until now: organising together to stand up to Murdoch’s media empire,” Rudd said.\n“Australians know in their guts that it’s wrong for one man to wield so much political power, whether it’s a far-right American billionaire or anyone else.\n“These senators have spent more than a year sifting through the evidence for and against a royal commission. Their recommendations should be heeded. The political parties should be given time and space to digest and consider this report, free from interference by Murdoch’s aggressive lobbying campaigns.”"

    "raw_text": "Hours before Lachlan Murdoch dropped his defamation case against Crikey, the ABC dropped its own reaction to Fox News and Dominion reaching a $787.5m settlement over US election lies.\nIn a move which could be interpreted as the public broadcaster thumbing its nose at News Corporation and the local media watchdog, Four Corners will re-broadcast Sarah Ferguson’s spicy documentary Fox and the Big Lie on Monday.\n“Fox will no longer be scrutinised through a trial, so this is the complete story,” the ABC said.\nThis is a bold move because the two-part doco infuriated News Corp Australia and Fox News, and triggered an unprecedented 45 articles in local papers. The Australian called it a “full-frontal hit job on Rupert Murdoch, News Corp and the US Fox News channel”.\nWhen the ABC didn’t budge, Fox took its lengthy complaint to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma).\nAcma said it breached the accuracy and fair dealing requirements of the ABC’s editorial code, but did not violate impartiality standards.\nThe 7.30 host responded with a furious 1,200-word piece published by the ABC, saying that she “expected the Fox Corporation to complain loudly about our coverage. I did not expect ACMA to respond in the terms it did”.\nOne of Acma’s more dubious findings was that using the word “mob” to describe the 6 January rioters was emotive and strident language.\nAsked whether the program would include the elements Acma said breached editorial standards, the ABC said the two-part program had been edited and updated.\n“Fox and the Big Lie has been edited to be a standalone program and updated to include the latest developments,” a spokesperson said. “It abides by the highest editorial standards.”\nFox and the Big Lie goes to air on Monday 24th April at 8.30pm on ABC TV and ABC iview.\n-\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe Oz’s own goal\nIt might be the first time the Australian has told readers that its editorial pages are routinely “tainted by right-wing idiocies”.\nBut on Thursday the Australian’s feature writer Greg Bearup quoted John McDonald, the Sydney Morning Herald’s art critic, insulting the masthead along those lines.\n“He said while editorial pages of The Australian were routinely ‘tainted by right-wing idiocies’, it was one of the few places willing to do a big investigative story on the arts”, Bearup reported in his investigation into the level of white involvement in some Indigenous art.\nBut before the SMH laughs too hard at the Oz’s self-own, Macdonald took a swipe at his own august journal the Herald on the way through.\n“My own paper, the SMH, has fallen into the trap of feeling it has to be ‘supportive’ of institutions such as the NGA, running a week-long ‘campaign’ to argue the case for more government funding,” McDonald said in his newsletter which we are sure he didn’t expect to end up on the front page of the Australian.\nAlbrechtsen targets ‘diversity divas’\nWhile the Bearup article did not give any examples of said “right-wing idiocies” in the Oz we found a good example this week in Janet Albrechtsen’s column, “Women’s climb to the top should be a matter of choice”.\nAlbrechtsen was commenting on statistics that revealed that, while women comprise just over 40% of non-executive directors of ASX 200 companies, only 11% of bosses of ASX 200 companies are women. But she believes this disparity is not down to structural sexism but to women’s choices.\nShe doesn’t think we need policies to close the gap and refers to women who “demand” equality as “diversity divas”.\n“As usual, the ‘one size fits all’ brigade – who are not satisfied with equality of opportunity but want equality of outcome – miss the real point,” Albrechtsen wrote. “The culprit is not negligent boards, lack of quotas, oppression or misogyny but that women very often make different choices to men.”\nDevine chides the disappointed\nAustralian journalist Miranda Devine, now part of the rightwing media in New York with a column in the New York Post and regular appearances on Fox News, chided journalists for being disappointed the Dominion v Fox News trial was settled this week.\nOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was also disappointed, echoing many Australian journalists and media watchers who had been salivating about the trial. “Dammit, I want my trial, I want it!” Colbert said. “You were supposed to be provide me with six weeks of delicious content. I wanted to see Rupert Murdoch put his hand on the Bible and burst into flames.”\nDevine: “All the disappointed media operatives huddled at Wilmington’s Superior Court, like [New York Times columnist Michelle] Goldberg and CNN’s crestfallen Oliver Darcy, could make themselves useful in the president’s hometown.\n“They could investigate a story that is bigger than Watergate but which they have shamefully avoided or downplayed for almost three years: Biden family corruption and the associated coverup, including by the FBI and Big Tech.”\nWhen she was not writing about Hunter Biden’s laptop, Devine was one of Rupert Murdoch’s loyalists who pushed the line that Biden’s election win will always be questioned. Her articles remain online despite Fox paying a $787.5m settlement to Dominion for broadcasting lies about the election.\n“While most media have derided Powell’s claims, there is a long history of fraud complaints from all sides of politics about Dominion and other electronic voting machines,” Devine wrote back in 2020.\nBut Devine is expanding her remit beyond Hunter. According to US media columnist Max Tani in Semafor, Devine has the “lucrative, dicey assignment” of writing the “house biography” of Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\nColbert discovers Crikey\nColbert picked up on the now-defunct Australian court case, and poked fun at Crikey’s name in the same Fox News segment on The Late Show.\n“Fox is trying to make some money back here, because they’re also a plaintiff and election lawsuit on behalf of Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch, seen here [in a photo] asking Rupert, ‘what happened to my new step mommy?’\n“Lachlan is suing an Australian website for implying he was a conspirator in the January 6 insurrection. The actual name of that website, Crikey News. If Crikey loses it’ll be good for its main competitor Didgeridoo.”\nUnfortunately, Colbert attempted to play a didgeridoo, failing to pick up on the cultural sensitivity around a non-Indigenous person playing the ceremonial instrument.\nIrvine’s bumpy exit\nThe senior economics writer with the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, Jessica Irvine, has resigned from Nine and will begin a new role producing personal finance content for the Commonwealth Bank next month.\nIrvine has been a prominent figure on the mastheads for 18 years – bar a two-year stint as national economics editor of News Corp’s tabloids – and made a name for herself by sharing details of her own budget with readers. She wrote a best-selling book, Money with Jess, and has a popular Instagram account with financial tips.\nThe head of external communications at CBA, Danny Johns, told Weekly Beast Irvine will “help lead and develop content and resources on personal finance, financial inclusion and financial literacy as part of the support and guidance we provide to our customers and the community”.\nBut Irvine’s transition from high-profile newspaper reporter to CommBank communications professional did not go as smoothly as the Herald and Age’s editors would have liked.\nIn December, Irvine and Ross Greenwood from Sky News agreed to be interviewed by the CommBank marketing team for an explainer on the cost of living. We are told this was an unpaid gig.\nIn the video, which is still on the CommBank website, Irvine introduces herself as “the economics editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age” and her title is super-imposed on the screen.\nWhen the video was re-edited into a social media post that looked more like an ad, Nine’s executive editor, Tory Maguire, became aware of it, and Irvine was asked to explain. Nine asked for the posts to be removed."

    "raw_text": "Labour has just one overriding task. Forget all the other missions and milestones: Britain faces a peril that was beyond imagining a short time ago. Saving the country from Nigel Farage is the urgent, patriotic duty of this government; it is vital that it prevents an extremist, racist, authoritarian takeover which would be against the will of the overwhelming majority of the population. Nothing else matters more.\nThe Labour government has come adrift. It lacks direction and purpose. Its many welcome policies are missing any thread to make sense of them. Now a new role and function have arrived, uninvited. It’s not a political choice but an obligation when the country is under attack from a poisonous enemy. Electoral malfunction risks gifting unrepresentative power to a nativist, xenophobic, divisive, anti-democratic, utterly mendacious party which spouts contempt for knowledge, science and expertise, let alone community and compassion, and calls it “common sense”.\nYet the government has vacillated. When ministers mumble in response to repugnant racism, it speaks volumes. Silence is not an option when the right is becoming so toxic. The former Conservative and Ukip MP Douglas Carswell, once a relative Ukip moderate, recently tweeted: “From Epping to the sea, let’s make England Abdul free.” He marks the racist trajectory. Once he attacked Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech and praised Britain as being “more at ease with the multi-ethnic society”: now he speaks proudly what once was unsayable among Brexiters. Lucy Connolly, a woman from Northampton who received a year’s prison sentence for stirring up racial hatred against asylum seekers last year – after tweeting “Mass deportation now, set fire to all the fucking hotels full of the bastards for all I care … If that makes me racist so be it” – has become a free speech heroine platformed by the Telegraph and Reform.\nLabour should have no trouble making racism unacceptable. Mock the right’s absurdities, such as Reform handing a conference slot to a vaccine-sceptic adviser to the Trump administration. Hammer Farage for the Brexit calamity, and shed the fear of alienating Reform voters: they are not coming back. Put David Lammy at the front of this assault: if permitted, he can be fiery on a public platform. But it’s what the leader says that seals the party’s fate.\nKeir Starmer had the grace to regret his “island of strangers” speech. Now he needs to abandon soft-pedalling. Reviewing a survey of 30,000 people that was taken just after that speech, Rob Ford, a professor of political science at Manchester University, tells me it found Starmer had “increased the salience of immigration and decreased the Labour vote without gaining any voters back from Reform”. A similar dynamic is playing out across Europe. “If you hug the radical right,” Ford says, “you will lose.” The Tories’ fatal attempts to try to outdo Reform as their party heads for extinction are an object lesson in how futile this strategy is.\nInstead, Labour should draw a bright red line and make itself the standard-bearer of the fight against Farage. “Blue” Labour and nervous “red wall” MPs are plain wrong to think they can woo back Reform voters. John Curtice, prime psephologist at the National Institute for Social Research, finds that half of Boris Johnson’s 2019 voters now back Farage, while Labour has lost just one in eight of its 2024 voters to Reform. These anti-migrant, pro-Brexit, socially conservative climate sceptics are wildly out of line with average British opinion. About 49% of them say equal opportunities for black and Asian people have gone too far: only 18% of the population agrees.\nThe British Social Attitudes survey found that 81% of Reform voters think migrants have undermined the country’s culture and economy rather than enriched it, against about 31% of all voters. Only 33% of Reform voters believe the climate crisis is caused by human activity, compared with 54% of the public in general. Nor do Reform voters lean left on spending. Only 25% want taxes raised to pay for health, education and social benefits, against 46% of the general public. Curtice’s message is that Labour should forget chasing these voters. The party needs to stop acting weak-kneed and nervous about being cast as the “elite”, when its own values are closest to the public, and should leave misguided Tories to scrabble after those votes.\nBut let’s hear those values. To fight off Farage, Labour needs to become acceptable enough to galvanise voters who are departing to the Greens and Liberal Democrats to, at the very least, encourage them to vote tactically. The cabinet reshuffle suggests no change of direction, but nor does it rule it out. Tightening effective handling of unregistered arrivals is an essential duty for any government: people rightly expect borders to be as controlled as possible.\nBut Labour is confusing an ordinary function of government with its own political purpose. It should stop endlessly emphasising migration, and remind people that Britain needs migrants to staff the NHS, build houses and work as scientists. It should use every chance to champion what Labour stands for. Start cutting child poverty. Talk up falling NHS waiting lists, free nursery places, progress on planning, new towns and mega-developments on green energy. “Growth” sounds abstract: these are all growth-makers.\nThe loss of Angela Rayner is a tragedy. Her human warmth, her championing of social housing and her highly popular focus on working rights will all be missed from the cabinet. Labour should continue to talk up these flagship markers of its identity. With just 20% of the vote, according to a recent poll, Labour has very little to lose. No party has ever lost so much support so fast, Ford told me. So doubling down on a failed approach looks like folly.\nWith 400 seats and nearly four more years, there’s every good reason to stop prevaricating with the public and tell the truth about the economy before the budget. Taxes must rise for all, most of all for the richest, and council tax must be rectified: everyone knows it’s outrageously unfair, and councils lack funds for playgrounds, potholes and old people. Raising tax would break a manifesto pledge, but the alternative, public service cuts, would be worse. Being honest about this situation might help restore a little trust. Of course, a hostile media will monster Labour for this, but a dose of honesty would help the party regain some support.\nRemember this: the die is not yet cast in this era of wild volatility. Look how Mark Carney in Canada and Anthony Albanese in Australia soared out of nowhere. Four years ago, we were at peak Boris Johnson, glumly anticipating another 10 years of his bogus bonhomie. Change could be as dramatic again in the next four years. Labour needs to be that change-maker to save the country from Farage.\n-\nPolly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer has said he “deeply regrets” a speech in which he described the UK as being in danger of becoming an island of strangers without tough curbs on immigration.\nIn an interview with the Observer, the prime minister said he should have read the speech more carefully and “held it up to the light a bit more”.\nThe speech, delivered in May to unveil Labour’s immigration policy, was criticised for seeming to echo Enoch Powell’s infamous 1968 “rivers of blood” speech in which Powell claimed Britain’s white population would be “strangers in their own country”.\nAfter the speech, Starmer’s official spokesperson said the prime minister “absolutely stands by” his language, including claims that mass immigration had done “incalculable damage” to the British economy.\nHowever, in the interview with his biographer Tom Baldwin, Starmer said: “I wouldn’t have used those words if I had known they were, or even would be, interpreted as an echo of Powell. I had no idea – and my speechwriters didn’t know either. But that particular phrase – no, it wasn’t right. I’ll give you the honest truth: I deeply regret using it.”\nIn the interview, he also talked about a firebomb attack on the door of his family home in London hours before the speech. However, he stressed he was not using the attack as an excuse for the language, or blaming his advisers, saying he himself should have paid more attention.\nHe also acknowledged there were “problems with the language” in his foreword to the policy document that said the record numbers of immigrants entering the UK under the last government had done “incalculable damage” to the country.\nHe said it was the case that Labour had “become too distant from working-class people on things like immigration”, but he said: “This wasn’t the way to do it in this current environment.”\nIn his speech in mid-May, Starmer said: “Let me put it this way: nations depend on rules, fair rules. Sometimes they are written down, often they are not, but either way they give shape to our values, guide us towards our rights, of course, but also our responsibilities, the obligations we owe to each other.\n“In a diverse nation like ours … we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.”\nAfterwards, several Labour MPs questioned whether Starmer’s policies were fuelling racism. Sarah Owen, the Labour chair of the women and equalities committee, who is of Malaysian-Chinese heritage, said: “Chasing the tail of the right risks taking our country down a very dark path. The best way to avoid becoming an ‘island of strangers’ is investing in communities to thrive, not pitting people against each other.”\nNadia Whittome said anti-migrant rhetoric from the government was “shameful and dangerous”. The Labour MP for Nottingham East said: “To suggest that Britain risks becoming ‘an island of strangers’ because of immigration mimics the scaremongering of the far right.”\nIn the wide-ranging conversation, Starmer also acknowledged it was wrong of him to have appointed Sue Gray, the former senior civil servant, as his chief of staff – only for her to depart a year later and be replaced by the campaigns chief Morgan McSweeney.\nHe said: “Not everyone thought it was a good idea when I appointed her … It was my call, my judgment, my decision, and I got that wrong. Sue wasn’t the right person for this job.”\nHe also discussed the death of his brother Nick on Boxing Day last year, saying he had personally gone up to Leeds to sort out his brother’s belongings, with his security detail waiting outside.\n“The previous day I had been taking calls on the future of European security and there I was, on my hands and knees with a brush scrubbing out the back of the bog,” he said. “That’s quite a good leveller … I didn’t want anyone else there. He was my brother – I didn’t want to let him down.”\nStarmer has spoken in the past about his protectiveness towards Nick, who had developed learning difficulties after complications during his birth, and who died of cancer aged 60."

    "raw_text": "One hundred and twenty miles from Westminster, it felt like I had arrived at the perfect place to understand the meaning of Angela Rayner’s exit from the government: Reform UK’s brief conference, a giddy and surreal gathering of about 10,000 people in a hangar-like box on the edgelands of Birmingham.\nNews of her resignation broke a couple of hours into the event’s first day, and the symbolism was glaring. Among midday pints, onstage pyrotechnics and a huge stand advertising the wonders of investing in gold, a party led by those bumptious public schoolboys Nigel Farage and Richard Tice was suddenly rejoicing in the departure of British politics’ most prominent working-class woman. The news, moreover, only boosted an atmosphere of energy and optimism, laced with a delighted surprise at what might be the UK’s defining political fact. We all know it: this new party has a tiny handful of MPs, no meaningful policy platform and a worldview that constantly blurs into conspiracy theory, but Reform UK is on course to either form or lead the next British government.\nThere are lots of reasons for that, and most of them cast very harsh light on the failings of Keir Starmer and his allies. As toxic as its messages always are, Reform has vivid and simple stories – about immigration, diversity and the supposedly endless failings of the two traditional parties. Its leading figures instinctively understand that politics has long since turned raw and primary-coloured. And it uses its complete inexperience of power as an advantage: the only answer to the UK’s inertia and failure, it says, is to hand the keys to untried outsiders.\nWhether we like it or not, Farage is also the embodiment of the transformation of politics by celebrity culture, a change massively accelerated by the dominance of social media. Jargon-heavy, technocratic, man-in-a-suit politics suits neither our modern means of communication, nor a world that seems to be constantly gripped by noisy chaos. Instead, success increasingly requires an altogether more performative, authentic – or, in his case, faux-authentic – style of leadership, and the ability to confidently rise above the din and make yourself heard.\nWith all that in mind, look at the Starmer government and where the events of the past few days leave it. Rayner was hardly a political wizard, but until she was swamped by stories about stamp duty and seaside flats, she was probably the only Labour high-up who brought a visibly human element to the business of government, and could talk movingly about life at the sharp end. Her policy priorities – not least her energetic championing of social housing – were focused on exactly the parts of the electorate to whom Farage most powerfully speaks. Moreover, she was at least a modest counterweight to the power wielded by Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney – who has seized the opportunity provided by her resignation for a reshuffle, and seemingly encouraged Starmer to lean even further into the blank, technocratic approach that has defined this government from the start.\nAt cabinet level, there has been a frenzy of job swapping, but no sense of any rethink. We will see what transpires at Labour’s conference, but the PM and his colleagues still seem to be spurning narratives and stories in favour of the vapid idea that power can be reduced to a model of “delivery” that shows no real signs of actually delivering anything. If you want an instant sense of how little this has to offer, look again at the video Starmer put out a few days before the Rayner crisis: 35 tedious seconds in which he talks about getting “all the No 10 staff together” and “marching forward to the next phase of government”. The resulting feeling is all too familiar: he looks like a man standing close to a burning house, promising a set of new shelves and a couple of nice rugs.\nMeanwhile, some of the biggest questions about what he and his colleagues are doing centre on the government’s approach to what Farage thinks is his strongest ground. The new home secretary is the Birmingham MP Shabana Mahmood – who, we are told, will intensify the government’s cold, punitive rhetoric on asylum, immigration and so-called small boats. Clearly, the government needs to sort out the chaos in the asylum system, and it should sometimes talk – carefully – about the challenges of integration. But as evidenced by Starmer’s “island of strangers” speech, it is actually floundering into much more dangerous political spaces, again and again.\nFor yet more proof, go back only a fortnight, to the speech Farage gave about mass deportations, paying the Taliban to take back people who come here from Afghanistan, and yet another suggestion that the UK is on the brink of social collapse. Starmer’s spokesperson declined to criticise any of it. Labour, in other words, does not want to contest his most fundamental ideas, nor point out how dangerous they are; indeed, its instinct is to blankly validate them. The result: Reform UK is not just riding high thanks to Farage’s shamelessness and skill. Amazingly, Labour is actively helping.\nWhich brings us to the awful urgency of this moment. If Reform UK succeeds in taking power, what does anyone think will happen to state education, our systems of justice, crime and punishment, or the BBC? What will everyday life feel like amid Farage’s promised mass deportations? If you woke up a couple of weeks ago and found your neighbourhood suddenly covered in flags (note the pathetic response of Yvette Cooper, the-then home secretary: “Oh put ’em up anywhere. I would put them up anywhere”), imagine the people who glory in that kind of sectarian territory-marking running the country. Then watch Starmer in action, and ask yourself: does he understand what’s at stake here?\nOf course, there is nothing easy about any of this: to shout “be bold” and deny the gravity of the government’s predicament would be as crass as many of its own pronouncements. But deep uncertainties nag away, and Rayner’s exit makes them even more pressing. In a new political age, does the prime minister understand what leadership really involves? And even if he does, can he actually provide it?\nThose concerns can be put another way, which cuts straight to the ice-cold political winds that I felt whirling around Birmingham. The idea that we are at one of the gravest moments in our peacetime history might sound melodramatic, but it has to be confronted. And so does a question that will sooner or later become unavoidable: does Starmer’s presence at the top help or hinder the onward march of the darkest forces to have ever been so close to taking control?\n-\nJohn Harris is a Guardian columnist\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "In 1955, the American columnist William F Buckley Jr declared that a conservative is someone “who stands athwart history, yelling ‘Stop’.” But today’s conservatives are not only trying to resist the advance of history, they are attempting to pull the train of history backwards and reopen the case on what constitutes a democratic society.\nLast month, the Smithsonian’s secretary received a letter from the Trump administration announcing that all exhibits deemed “divisive” or “ideological” should be replaced with those labelled “historical” and “constructive”. Within days, a list of offending displays was published and, unsurprisingly, they overwhelmingly targeted artefacts that highlight Black, Latino and LGBTQ+ experiences in the American story.\nAt first glance, it might seem absurd for a president juggling a global trade war caused by his avalanche of tariffs, domestic economic chaos caused by his “big beautiful bill” and intractable conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine to be fretting over museum artefacts. But these attacks are not just distractions from the major issues; they provide the ideological justification for real material and legislative changes that will impact people’s day-to-day lives.\nThe Trump administration does not only turn to hot-button culture wars because they know they will capture the media’s attention; they use these conversations as the narrative doorway through which laws can be passed that erode rights for poor and vulnerable communities across the board. This happened when the furore over diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) resulted in a set of executive orders that terminated all DEI and accessibility initiatives within federal agencies and contractors, leading to the closure of racial equity programmes and offices that monitored sexual harassment issues, and the targeting of disability rights compliance and outreach programmes to economically disadvantaged communities.\nWe see the same strategy from Washington to Westminster, where the populist right is also on the rise. At last year’s general election, Reform UK called for sweeping changes to how British history is taught, demanding a “patriotic” and “balanced” approach that counters the increased interest in British imperialism and the transatlantic slave trade that has arisen in the aftermath of the global Black Lives Matter uprising. While Reform presents this call to reverse the curriculum as neutral, it works to rewrite the narrative on Britain into an “island story”.\nIn this framing, Britain transforms from being a centuries-long, globe-spanning empire into a besieged little island, with the influx of migrants being an inexplicable modern plague rather than the aftershock of imperial entanglement. Local protests outside temporary accommodation for asylum seekers can be portrayed as spontaneous community defence, being pushed forward by “genuinely concerned families”. This narrowing of the national story clears the way for Nigel Farage’s vision of Britain, with a flagship immigration policy of “mass deportations” of asylum seekers. The Reform leader told Channel 4 that “we cannot be responsible for all the world’s sins”.\nThe dismantling of democracy and the rewriting of the nation’s story go together like salt and pepper in the populist right’s recipe book. When it talks of pushing back against the decolonisation of the curriculum, it is also seeking to erase the memory of the mid-20th century, when, in purely juridical terms, we saw the greatest democratic expansion in human history. Millions of people across the world who hadn’t ever had a say in choosing their own leaders suddenly received the right to vote. To forget this is to forget that democracy was fought for globally. It is not an automatic birthright that is given out of kindness from the powerful to the weak.\nThis is the lesson of decolonisation struggles and racial justice activism that the populist right is seeking to bury under the sands of time. When Trump’s team rail against DEI, they are not just talking about getting rid of monotonous unconscious bias training. They mean getting rid of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. There is a larger ambition at work: to unpick the social contract that underpinned the liberal order of the 20th century, and the juridical architecture that reinforced it.\nThe libertarian polemicist and ideological godfather of today’s populist conservatives, Murray Rothbard, said in 1992: “We shall repeal the 20th century.” The slogan has become a rallying cry for those who seek to demolish the framework of race relations law, women’s rights, worker protections, and the democratic mechanisms that provide a protective casing within which vulnerable people can live with dignity.\nPushing back against this project means refusing the divide and rule tactics on which the populist right relies. It requires building cross-communal solidarities that recognise the shared stakes between those targeted by racialised narratives and those facing economic dispossession. The same politicians willing to strip a refugee of due process will also strip a worker of union rights. The same people working to erase the history of empire are the ones who will hollow out any institutions of mass democracy that could mount a challenge against spiralling inequality.\nCivil rights in the US and decolonisation in the UK weren’t just about race. Read the work of Kwame Nkrumah, Walter Rodney or Fred Hampton and it is clear that these movements were driven by concerns for housing, healthcare, dignified work. If we want to defend the wins of the 20th century, we can’t let history be rewritten in the 21st.\n-\nDr Kojo Koram teaches at the School of Law at Birkbeck, University of London, and writes on issues of law, race and empire.

    "raw_text": "In a letter sent to Smithsonian secretary, Lonnie G Bunch III, on 12 August, the Trump administration announced its plan to replace all Smithsonian exhibits deemed as “divisive” or “ideological” with descriptions deemed as “historical” and “constructive”. On 21 August, just nine days later, the White House published a list of said offending fixtures – the majority of which include exhibits, programming and artwork that highlight the Black, Latino and LGBTQ+ perspectives on the American project. Included in his bill of particulars was an exhibit that rightly depicts Benjamin Franklin as an enslaver, an art installation that acknowledges race as a social construct and a display that highlights racist voter suppression measures, among others.\nThe assault on the Smithsonian comes wrapped, as it were, as part of a broader attack on democracy, scenes of which we see playing out every day. The federal occupation of Washington DC, the crackdown on free speech on campus, the targeting of Trump’s political opponents, the gerrymandering of democracy – these are interwoven elements of the same structural assault. So with many fires burning across the nation, concerned citizens who are answering the call to fight the destruction of democracy may regard his attack on history and memory as a mere skirmish, a distraction from the herculean struggle against fascism unfolding in the US. But this is a mistake. Trump’s attack on American museums, education and memory, along with his weaponization of racialized resentment to package his authoritarian sympathies as mere patriotism, is a critical dimension of his fascist aims. The fight for democracy cannot avoid it, nor its racial conditions of possibility.\nFascism always has a central cultural component, because it relies on the construction of a mythic past. The mythic past is central to fascism because it enables and empowers a sense of grievance by a dominant racial or ethnic group whose consent is crucial to the sustainability of the project. In Maga world, the mythic past was pure, innocent and unsullied by women or Black leaders. In this kind of politics, the nation was once great, a byproduct of the great achievements of the men in the dominant racial group. In short, the assault on the Smithsonian and, more broadly, against truthful history and critical reflection is part of the broader fascist attack on democracy.\nFrom this vantage point, racial equality is a threat to the story of the nation’s greatness because only the men of the dominant group can be great. To represent the nation’s founding figures as flawed, as any accurate history would do, is perceived, in this politics, as a kind of treason.\nThe success of the fascist dismantling of democracy is predicated on the widespread systematic failure to see the larger picture. The anti-woke assault that is a key pillar of Trumpism is part of that failure, partly due to the racial blinders and enduring ambivalence of too many in positions of leadership in the media and elsewhere. Those who sign on to the attack on “wokeness” but regard themselves as opponents of the other elements of the fascist assault are under the mistaken assumption that these projects can be disaggregated. In fact, the dismantling of democracy and of racial justice are symbiotically entangled. To support one is to give cover for the others.\nIt is clear that the Trump administration understands this relationship and fully weaponizes racist appeals as a foundational piece of its fascist agenda. And if this was once the quiet part, it is now pronounced out loud in official government documents. In an executive order issued on 27 March 2025 titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, Trump reveals that his mandate to ban “improper ideologies” targets core commitments repudiating a scientific racism that historically naturalized racial hierarchy thereby neutralizing resistance. According to Trump, the problem with the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s exhibit The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture was that it promoted the idea that “race is a human invention”.\nThe understanding that race is a social construct as opposed to a biological fact is perhaps the most fundamental advance in repudiating enslavement, genocide and segregation. Rejecting the idea that racial inequality is natural or pre-ordained – a claim that grounded enslavement and dispossession in America – forms the cornerstone of the modern commitment to a fully inclusive democracy. Trump’s declaration that this cornerstone is “improper” is an effort to turn the clock back, upending the entire American postwar project. It is no coincidence that this “proper” ideology Trump exposes is constitutive of a more well-known strand of fascism – nazism. How else can we understand why Maya Angelou was purged from the Naval Academy library while Adolf Hitler remains?\nThe fight against fascism in the US must be as robust in its embrace of racial equality as Trump’s embrace of outdated ideas about race and racism. The defense of memory, of truthful history, of telling the whole American story rather than ascribing agency in history to the deeds of “great men” is vital to the American democratic project. A pro-democratic education fosters the agency of its citizens by teaching about social movements that overturned entrenched hierarchies which blocked democratic equality and imposed racial tyranny. The story of how ordinary Americans lived and struggled and remade America is essential knowledge in developing and sustaining a multiracial democracy. The Smithsonian has been a vital institution in making this knowledge accessible to the masses. The National Museum of the American Latino and the National Museum of the American Indian, for example, provide artifacts and perspectives about the nation’s westward expansion that challenge the myth of unoccupied territory and manifest destiny. The National Museum of African American History and Culture brings forward the global scale of enslavement as well as its infusion across national institutions, culture and politics.\nMuseums allow us to reckon with the brutality of the American legacy as well as expose our citizens to the people, institutions and strategies that charted a different course towards becoming a “more perfect” union. Fascist erasures like Trump’s hide behind the claim that truthful encounters with the past inflame and divide. This instinct is the opposite of the truth. A functioning democracy does not restrict perspectives to those of the dominant group, much less make it illegal to teach alternative ones.\nA people who cannot remember their past are a people who cannot resist a fascist future. Knowing our history can give us the weapons and wherewithal to battle Trump’s efforts to catapult us back to a time when the majority of Americans lacked both the civic and economic power that we have now. The fight for our museums and for our memory is a critical bulwark against the unraveling of American democracy. It is vital that we fight to protect our repositories before it’s too late.\n-\nKimberlé Crenshaw is an American civil rights advocate and a scholar of critical race theory.

    "raw_text": "The ever-bombastic Donald Trump has boasted repeatedly of his trade victories, while White House news releases trumpet his “historic trade wins”. The Wall Street Journal echoed Trump’s triumphalism with a headline saying, “Trump is Winning His Trade War”, and last week the New York Times used the exact same words in a headline. That must have been music to the president’s ears.\nForgive me for being a spoilsport, but I don’t see where the victory is or how Trump is winning. I keep reading how Trump’s trade war and tariff machinations have pushed up inflation, slashed US job gains, slowed economic growth and caused the manufacturing sector to sputter.\nThe rate of job growth plunged by over 70% in the three months after Trump unveiled his 2 April “liberation day” tariffs that filled corporate executives with uncertainty and dread. Trump is palpably impatient for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, but the higher prices resulting from his tariffs are likely to delay the rate cuts he desperately wants. So can someone please tell me where is the victory here?\nTrump further proclaims that his tariffs are wondrous because, he says, they will generate trillions of dollars in revenue for the US Treasury. But those revenues will come out of the hides of tens of millions of American consumers who will pay Trump’s taxes on imports. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that the price increases caused by Trump’s tariffs will cost the typical US household $2,400 in 2025. As a result of the tariffs, the budget lab says, apparel prices will soar 37% and shoe prices 39%. What Trump boasts as a win is a loss for millions of typical Americans.\nSome economists are warning that Trump’s tariffs will bring back stagflation, a dangerous combination of rising prices and slowing growth last seen in the 1970s. Pointing to signs of stagflation, BMO Economics wrote: “Economic activity and job growth are sputtering under the weight of higher tariffs, increasing inflation and rising economic policy and trade uncertainty.” Doesn’t look as if Trump’s trade war is winning there.\nTrump recently said on CNBC’s Squawk Box that “people love the tariffs”, but evidently the people he’s talking about aren’t the American people. A recent Fox News poll of registered voters found that Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump’s tariff policies by 62% to 36%. Ben May, a forecaster at Oxford Economics, said his tariffs will hurt US families because “they are obviously raising prices … and squeezing household incomes”.\nMany days it seems that Trump tries to dominate the news cycle with some tariff announcement or other: 50% on Brazil, double India’s tariffs to 50%, impose a 100% tariff on semiconductors. (Even some Maga folks probably think he uses tariff announcements to distract from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.) This week the White House dismayed the world by announcing that Trump would impose tariffs, ranging from 15% to 50%, on 90 countries effective Thursday. As a result of Trump’s tariff craze, the average effective tariff rate on imports into the US will be 18%, up from 2.3% last year – the highest level since the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930 worsened the Great Depression.\nRemember when Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted last April that the administration would negotiate 90 deals in 90 days. That didn’t come close to happening. But Trump did pressure the EU, Japan and South Korea into reluctantly accepting trade deals that call for tariffs of 15% – a compromise down from the 25% and 30% levels Trump had been demanding. Even though the EU, Japan and South Korea have long been among America’s closest allies, Trump used nasty threats to get them to accept those tariffs, which will hurt those countries’ manufacturers, while also hurting US consumers.\nHere’s one way to look at Trump’s strong-arm tactics: when a bully demands that a person do something that that person doesn’t want to do and that something will hurt not just that person, but also the bully’s family – and probably the bully, too, long-term – how is that winning, rather than bull-headed destructiveness? Some headline writers might lazily conclude that Trump is winning his trade war (a war of headstrong destructiveness), but in that war, everyone and everything, except Trump’s limitless ego and a handful of US industries, are losers.\nThere are many other reasons Trump’s trade deals shouldn’t be viewed as victories. Trump’s main motivation for tariffs is arguably to increase manufacturing in the US, but factory activity has actually declined in recent months, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Harley-Davidson says it has reduced production because of tariff-induced uncertainty and higher expenses. Ford, which assembles more cars in the US than any other automaker, complains that Trump’s tariff mess caused its profits to fall by $800m in the second quarter. Trumps’s mishmash of tariffs, including steep import taxes on steel, aluminum and auto parts, have made Ford’s production more problematic and expensive.\nTrump’s trade war has pushed relations with many countries to their worst point in decades. Acting more like a mob boss than a dealmaker, Trump has told various nations that if they promise to cough up several hundred billion dollars in investment in the US, he’ll make nice and lower their tariff rate. Or else. One economist called this “a global shakedown”. Many officials in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Canada are no doubt seething. Trump seems to treat Washington’s trading partners as punching bags – that’s not a winning strategy for the US or the world.\nAnother motivation behind Trump’s tariffs is his desire to erase the huge US trade deficit. That deficit has certainly been a problem, helping lead to myriad factory closings and job losses across blue-collar America. But even with its record trade deficits, the US has, by many measures, the world’s richest, most successful economy.\nTrump boasts that his tariffs are already bringing back some manufacturing – and there’s no denying that there are several examples, Last Wednesday, Apple vowed to invest $100bn in advanced manufacturing in the US, and GM plans to increase production of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks in Indiana while trimming output in Canada.\nNonetheless, there’s a huge question mark as to whether Trump’s tariffs will inspire a major manufacturing rebound in the US. Many experts say the 15% tariffs imposed on the EU, Japan and other places are too low to persuade companies to move production to the US. For corporations to build a new $500m factory in the US, they will want solid assurances of what economic conditions will be four and five years from now. But does anyone actually think that the mercurial Mr Trump won’t issue new tariff threats or order tariff changes within four or five weeks?\nPerhaps the newspaper headline should be, “Trump Has Already Lost a Pivotal Part of His Trade War.” All the months of Trump’s on-again, off-again, up-and-down tariffs may mean he has so spooked and alienated corporate planners that he will never achieve his goal of bringing back far more factories, notwithstanding other countries’ often-vague pledges of billions in investments.\nEven beyond that, in this age of AI, algorithms and a thriving service economy, it seems that Trump’s trade war – with the tremendous pain and disruption it is causing – might have made far more sense to help the economy of 50 or 75 years ago than the AI and information economy of today.\n-\nSteven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issues\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Last November, Donald Trump made a solemn vow to all Americans: “Every citizen, I will fight for you, your family and your future every single day.” Eight months later, Trump is vigorously backing many policies that will mean pain for millions.\nTrump has pushed to enact the Republican budget bill, which would make significant cuts to Medicaid, Obamacare, and food assistance, and would do the greatest damage to those Americans struggling hardest to make ends meet – the 30% of the US population that lives in households earning under $50,000 a year.\nEven as Trump and Republican lawmakers are rushing to cut over $1.4tn in health and food assistance for non-affluent Americans, Trump continues to pressure Congress to extend over $3tn in tax cuts that disproportionately help the wealthy and corporations.\nTrump has embraced these Robin-Hood-in-reverse policies, even though it was voters earning less than $50,000 a year who delivered victory to him last November. They favored him over Kamala Harris by 50% to 48%, according to exit polls, while Trump and Harris tied among voters earning $50,000 or more a year.\nSeveral social policy experts said Trump has engaged in hypocrisy at best and betrayal at worst when it comes to the working-class and blue-collar Americans he promised to fight for. Speaking about the Republicans’ “big, beautiful” budget bill, Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, said: “Who’s getting hit, who’s bearing the cost? It’s people with low and middle incomes, people that the president and many Republican policymakers promised to serve and support in the last election.”\nThe budget bill would mean a net financial loss for the bottom 30% of American households by income – after factoring in its tax provisions and cuts in benefits. The House bill would hit the lowest-earning 10% of Americans hardest: for them, it would mean a painful $1,600 cut in income on average (a 3.9% drop), according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). At the same time, the Trump-backed bill would be a boon to wealthy households – it would mean a $12,000 increase in net income, on average, for households in the top 10%, those earning above $692,000 a year. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the top 0.1% – those with income over $3.3m – would receive tax cuts of $103,500 on average.\nThe CBO says the income of the bottom 10% tops off at $22,868 (before factoring in government transfers). The second lowest decile earns from $22,868 to $43,137; the third decile earns up to $55,628; and the fourth up to $68,601.\nThe Yale Budget Lab found that the bottom 20% of US households would see their incomes drop by 2.9% on average over the next decade, and the second lowest quintile – moderate-income households – would suffer a 0.4% loss of income on average. But the richest 20% would see their incomes rise by 2.3%. Those in the top 1% would see their incomes climb by $29,585 on average.\nTrump is demanding these big tax cuts for the rich even though the CBO says the budget bill will increase the federal debt by $3.3tn – a move that will push up interest rates and make mortgages and home-buying more expensive.\nAccording to the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning thinktank, the $121bn tax cuts that would go just to the richest 1% next year are significantly more than all the tax cuts that would go to the bottom 60% of Americans in terms of income.\nThe poorest 20% of Americans would receive just 1% of the bill’s tax cuts next year, while the highest earning 5% would receive 44% of the cuts.\nLast week, Trump urged lawmakers to enact the bill, saying: “There are hundreds of things in there. It is so good.” At a news conference, the president said the more than $1tn in Medicaid and food assistance cuts wouldn’t hurt anyone.\n“It won’t affect anybody,” he said. “It is just fraud, waste and abuse.”\nBut Parrott took a sharply different view: “The bill stands alone historically for its unique upside-down mix of large tax cuts for the top, deep cuts that affect low- and middle-income people, and massive increases in deficits and debt.”\nJohn Ricco, the Yale Budget Lab’s associate director of policy analysis, said: “It’s unambiguous that low- and moderate-income Americans will be worse off on average under the budget bill, and that’s principally because the cuts in Medicaid and Snap [the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] would by definition fall most heavily on these groups,” Ricco said.\nJeanne Lambrew, the Century Foundation’s director of health policy reform, estimates that at least 16 million Americans will lose health coverage because of the budget bill – refuting White House claims that “no one will lose coverage”. Lambrew said the bill would cause a more than 50% increase in the number of uninsured nationwide, to nearly 45 million people.\nWhat’s more, the Trump-backed plan sharply reduces Affordable Care Act subsidies, and that will force millions of Americans to either drop coverage or pay far more for coverage. Millions of Americans will find it harder to obtain healthcare, with many forced to take on far more medical debt.\nWhile Trump and many Republicans say the Medicaid cuts are all about reducing “waste, fraud and abuse”, Lambrew calculates that a mere 3.5% of the $1tn in healthcare cuts come from cutting waste and abuse. “What Trump has been saying is, ‘We’re not cutting Medicaid. We’re just cutting fraud.’ That’s gaslighting.” Lambrew said.\nArchbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, sent the Senate a letter that harshly criticized the budget bill. “As Pope Leo XIV recently stated, it is the responsibility of politicians to promote and protect the common good, including by working to overcome great wealth inequality,” he wrote. “This bill does not answer this call. It takes from the poor to give to the wealthy.”\nAccording to a Quinnipiac University poll, only 27% of registered voters support the GOP budget bill, while 53% oppose it. A Fox News poll found that 38% support the bill, while 59% oppose it.\nThe House bill’s deep cuts in food benefits will cause 7 million people, including over 2 million children, to lose food aid or have their food aid cut significantly. The Trump-supported bill also makes sharp cuts in Pell grant awards. The Center for American Progress says this means 4.4 million students from low- and moderate-income families could lose some or all of their federal grant aid.\nIn another blow to Americans earning under $50,000, Trump pushed to have the budget bill eliminate the “Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program”, which, as one website put it, “keeps poor people from freezing to death at home”. Killing the program would end heating subsidies for 6 million Americans, but so far congressional Republicans have spared the program and not bowed to Trump on this.\nIn another blow to blue-collar Americans, the bill would undo much of Joe Biden’s efforts to speed the creation of clean-energy industries, and that could put hundreds of thousands of potential jobs at risk, many of them factory jobs.\n“In this bill, folks in Congress went out of their way not to give anything to low-income people,” said Chuck Marr, vice-president for federal tax policy at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. He noted that in previous tax cut bills that favored the rich, GOP lawmakers made sure to include some sweeteners for low- and moderate-income Americans.\n“But in this bill,” Marr said, “folks in Congress said: no, we’re going to go after these people. They’re going after healthcare and food, and these are the people who are also going to get hammered by Trump’s tariffs.” Lower-income people spend a higher percentage of their income on goods.\n“This bill is a major shift,” Marr added. “They’re taking away from poor people and working-class people and channeling it to very high-income people. I think it’s punitive. It’s harsh. It’s mean, brutal.”\nTrump’s tariffs would also hit less affluent Americans hardest. One study found that Trump’s planned tariffs would cause the bottom 20% of households to pay up to 5.5% of their income toward tariff-caused higher prices. That’s more than two and a half times the percentage that those in the top 20% would pay (2.1% of income).\nTrump has repeatedly boasted that the bill contains several provisions he championed to help working-class Americans. At a White House event to promote the bill, he pointed to a DoorDash driver from Wisconsin who was on hand to help make his case that the “no tax on tips” provision would help workers.\nBut tax experts say that provision will help only a tiny fraction of those earning under $50,000. Only 4% of workers in the bottom half by income are in tipped jobs. Moreover, nearly two-fifths of tipped workers are already earning so little that they don’t pay federal income taxes.\n“Given how the current income tax system works, this provision will provide little or no benefit to those workers,” said Ricco. “Those workers tend to have low incomes, and the US system doesn’t basically tax their incomes, and this won’t offer them any additional tax reduction.” In other words, the server making $100,000 a year at a high-end restaurant will benefit substantially from no tax on tips, while the hotel housekeeper or 20-hour-a-week waiter at a diner making $25,000 a year will be helped little or not at all.\nAs for Trump’s much-ballyhooed “no tax on overtime” provision, that, too, will do little for those earning under $50,000, Ricco said. “That provision is really geared to middle- and upper-middle groups,” he said. “People in the bottom 50% aren’t paying much income tax, and so no tax on overtime wouldn’t benefit them much. People in the bottom 40%, they’re often in a precarious employment situation. They’re generally not working 45 or 50 hours a week.”\nRicco estimated that for Americans in the bottom 40% by income, the no tax on overtime provision will mean “less than a $10 tax cut per year”. “It’s essentially a rounding error,” he said.\nRepublicans boast that increasing the child-tax credit will help millions of struggling families – the House bill would increase that credit, now $2,000, to $2,500, while the Senate raises it to $2,200. Under current law, one in four children – about 17 million – are ineligible to qualify for the full $2,000 credit because their family’s income is too low to qualify for the full credit. A two-parent family with two children needs to earn over $48,000 to obtain the full credit.\nUnder the House bill, a single parent with two children who earns $16,000 a year would get no additional tax credit, while a married couple with two kids and a $400,000 income would see their tax credit jump by $1,000.\nWith their eagerness to cut the social safety net, Republicans seem to be treating millions of Americans who earn less than $50,000 as undeserving takers. “People earning under $50,000 are major targets of the Republican agenda. Their health coverage is targeted. Their food security is targeted,” said Marr. “They are left out of key provisions expanding tax cuts, like the child tax credit. They are most at risk from the Republican tariffs. They’ll be hurt across the board.”\nMarr said the budget bill treats “these people very harshly”.\n“It’s the harshest bill we’ve ever seen since budget deficits became an issue 40 years ago,” he said. “This is the first bill that simultaneously targets programs for poor people and working-class people to pay for it, and then takes that money to pay for tax cuts for very wealthy people. It makes poor and working-class people worse off. That’s not been done before.”"

    "raw_text": "Within his first few days in office, Donald Trump reversed four years of work to increase diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the federal government.\nSince taking office, he’s signed a flurry of executive orders, two of which amount to crackdowns on DEI within the federal government. One overturns Joe Biden’s efforts to increase DEI programs in the federal government, while a second bans DEI measures from being taken by the federal government.\nThis isn’t Trump’s first time attacking DEI as president, but advocates are worried about the impact the orders will have not only on the federal government, but the entire American workforce. Here’s what we know so far about Trump’s orders.\nTwo anti-DEI executive orders\nThe first executive order largely scraps the DEI efforts that took place under Joe Biden, who had ordered all federal agencies to come up with equity plans. It terminates all “mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities in the federal government” that the Trump administration considers “illegal DEI and ‘diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility’ (DEIA) programs”.\nA second executive order broadly ends any DEI activities within the federal government. This order overturns a handful of executive orders from past presidents, including one from Lyndon B Johnson that was signed during the civil rights era and required federal contractors to adopt equal opportunity measures.\nWhat happens now?\nBecause the language in the executive orders is so broad, exactly what will happen under them remains unclear. But it generally gives the Trump administration broad power to do away with anything it considers DEI within the federal government.\nThe White House made it clear to federal employees just how serious its DEI crackdown will be. Federal employees are now required to report any colleagues they believe are furthering DEI efforts “in disguise”. Employees received emails warning of “adverse consequences” if they fail to report any colleagues who are still carrying out DEI measures.\nAre the executive orders legal?\nAs head of the executive branch, Trump has a lot of leeway over the federal government, and he has been exercising that power in the days since he’s re-entered the White House. Still, this doesn’t mean the DEI executive orders won’t be challenged in court.\nTrump and his advisers, including the billionaire Elon Musk, have been complaining about what they consider to be “government waste”. In addition to his attacks on anti-discrimination efforts, Trump declared that federal agencies should order their employees back to the office full time. He is also trying to reclassify some federal employees who are considered career civil servants, and thus are protected from firing when a new presidential administration comes in, as at-will employees whom his administration can then terminate.\nThe executive order has already amassed criticism for the adverse, long-term impact it could have on the federal workforce.\n“The federal government hires and promotes exclusively on the basis of merit. The results are clear: a diverse federal workforce that looks like the nation it serves, with the lowest gender and racial pay gaps in the country. We should be proud of that,” Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), a union representing 800,000 federal employees, said in a statement.\n“Ultimately, these attacks on DEIA are just a smokescreen for firing civil servants, undermining the apolitical civil service and turning the federal government into an army of yes-men loyal only to the president, not the Constitution.”\nThe years-long conservative fight against DEI\nDEI has been under attack from conservatives as part of the larger “culture wars” that began after 2020 as resistance to the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd.\nConservatives argue that DEI encourages preferences to marginalized groups, which amounts to “reverse discrimination” against white Americans, particularly white men.\nBut DEI is a broad term that encompasses many policies used within the workplace that were created to prevent discrimination of women, people of color and other historically marginalized groups – policies that ensure people are being considered for jobs and promotions on equal grounds and that create inclusive workplace environments.\nAfter the supreme court overturned affirmative action in higher education in 2023, conservatives unleashed a legal crusade against DEI in the workplace. Though the court’s affirmative action decision doesn’t mention DEI, conservatives have filed dozens of lawsuits over the last few years attacking hiring practices, training and affinity groups, among other practices. America First Legal, the conservative non-profit group of Stephen Miller, a key policy adviser to Trump, has filed multiple lawsuits against companies for their purported DEI efforts.\nBoth executive orders frame DEI as a type of “immoral discrimination” that amounts to “an unlawful, corrosive and pernicious identity-based spoils system”.\nAmalea Smirniotopoulos, senior policy counsel at the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, said that the orders reframe DEI as “somehow immoral and in violation of civil rights laws”.\n“It’s just not an accurate representation,” Smirniotopoulos said. “Fundamentally, DEI programs are about identifying barriers to opportunity that prevent talented and qualified people from contributing to the workforce, to entering higher education institutions and accessing programs. …\n“The Trump administration is trying to reframe both what these programs are and what our civil rights laws means, to really take away the tools that we need to ensure that everyone in this country can actually achieve the American dream.”\nWill the executive order affect private companies that still have DEI?\nNo, but Trump asked the US attorney general’s office to look into ways that it can get to the private sector.\nOne of the executive orders directs the attorney general’s office to give the administration “recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI”.\nDavid Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at New York University School of Law, said it wouldn’t be surprising if the White House tried to target DEI in the private sector.\n“I don’t think the orders released are the full universe of orders that will be issued by this administration,” Glasgow said. “There may be more to come”.\nAt the end of his first term, Trump tried to ban DEI training within private companies through an executive order. Though the order targeted companies that do contract work for the federal government, a federal judge still temporarily blocked the order on first amendment grounds.\nWhile the supreme court’s ruling on affirmative action has raised questions about specific DEI measures that give explicit preference to a group of people, like quotas, there are still no laws that make DEI policies in private companies illegal.\nStill, Trump’s strong anti-DEI stance has led to what advocates consider a “chilling effect”. Companies have started to pre-emptively drop their DEI policies, including many made in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, in fear of retaliation.\nSince Trump’s election, multiple companies, including Walmart, McDonald’s and Meta, all said they were ending at least some of their DEI policies. In a statement about the shift, Meta said that the “legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing”.\nBut some companies are doubling down. A conservative shareholder group recently tried to get Costco to re-evaluate its DEI policies, essentially pressuring the company to drop them, but the company pushed back.\nIn a statement, Costco’s board chair Tony James said: “We have always been purposefully non-political and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company’s culture and values since its founding”."

    "raw_text": "Last week, a federal judge blocked the justice department from canceling $3.2m in federal grants to the American Bar Association (ABA). The court agreed with the ABA’s claim that the administration was retaliating against it for taking public stances against Donald Trump.\nBut how had the US president retaliated? Which grants had he clawed back? Those supporting programs that train lawyers to defend victims of domestic and sexual violence.\nIt was just one of Trump’s many acts of aggression against perceived enemies that just happen to – or quite deliberately – target women.\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, after the release of the “grab ’em by the pussy” tape, Vox’s Libby Nelson noted that there was something fundamentally different about Trump’s sexism from the sexism of his predecessors. “Usually, the critique of Republican candidates has been based on policy – healthcare access and abortion rights – or on attitudes heavily influenced by religion,” she wrote. But “Trump’s anti-feminism owes more to the gleeful vulgarity and implicit threats of violence of 4chan than the traditional debate over what a woman’s role should be in the public square.”\nTrump II is both a personal and a political misogynist – a chimera with the soul of a snake and the brains of a policy wonk, transplanted from the authors of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.\nThe widest target of Trump’s aggression is the universe of people capable of having babies. Four days after the inauguration, his administration directed the justice department’s civil rights division to cease enforcing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (Face) Act, which prohibits harassment or blockage of patients entering abortion clinics. His administration dismissed three ongoing cases, pardoned 23 convicted violators of the law, and limited future prosecutions to “cases presenting significant aggravating factors, such as death, serious bodily harm, or serious property damage”.\nIn March, he began withholding tens of millions of dollars from Title X, the only federal program supporting reproductive healthcare. The move was not explicitly anti-abortion – the Hyde Amendment banned federal funding for abortion 50 years ago – but it was surely aimed at pleasing religious fundamentalists who oppose all interference with “natural” baby-making. Lots of providers, including some Planned Parenthood affiliates, immediately collapsed, leaving millions of people with no family planning, cancer screening or prenatal services. Now, having failed repeatedly to defund Planned Parenthood through legislation, Republicans are trying to hide the dirty deed in the budget. And like much of the “waste, fraud, and abuse” targeted by the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), these cuts would cost taxpayers far more than they would save: according to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost will be $300m over the next 10 years in unwanted births and shifts of reproductive services to other providers.\nTrump isn’t sparing mothers who want to be mothers, either. A week ago, funding to study maternal mortality was rescinded and most of the workers who monitor and improve maternal and child health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were placed on leave. The cuts came just after researchers at the National Institutes of Health published a paper documenting a huge rise in mothers’ deaths in childbirth or within a year afterward, most notably among Native American and Black women; the authors urged the government to make combatting these deaths “an urgent public health priority”.\nWhere women’s bodies are now subject to harm by intentional neglect, they will also be more vulnerable to harm by violence. Before his inauguration, Trump called for the execution of rapists. A few months later, the justice department suspended grant applications from non-profits providing emergency shelter, legal assistance and crisis services to victims of domestic and sexual violence under the Violence Against Women Act. The agencies were caught promoting “woke” agendas – evident from the word “gender”, as in “gender-based violence”, in their mission statements. The grant program appears to be back up on the justice department website, but no one knows for how long.\nIn late April, the administration zeroed out all funding for training, auditing, data collection and victim support under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), which Congress passed unanimously in 2003. Prea does not protect migrants in detention, but the Department of Homeland Security was nevertheless subject to oversight, and that included investigating sexual abuse by Ice employees. Not any more. In spite of thousands of complaints of sexual violence against detained women and children, the Trump administration closed the department’s three watchdog agencies, including the offices through which detainees could lodge complaints.\nAs part of its elimination of anything suggestive of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), the administration halted the military’s sexual assault prevention training. The defense department reported in 2023 that nearly a quarter of active-duty women were subject to sexual harassment – and they are just the ones who risked coming forward.\nThe policies that smash the legal bulwarks against sexual violence and those that put pregnant people’s lives at risk make for the most compelling subject lines on fundraising emails from advocates for women, people of color and other legally protected classes hardest.\nBut the disproportionate harm these folks are suffering from the decimation of the federal workforce by Doge is possibly most consequential, because it may not be reversible. Women and Black people are more likely to work in government jobs than in the private sector; a recent McKinsey analysis found that women, particularly women of color, are promoted at higher rates in public institutions than in private corporations. But government jobs also provide union representation, job security, pensions and other benefits that lift people of color into the middle class and allow them to accumulate the property and wealth denied them since slavery – benefits that do not accrue to home health aides, chambermaids and workers in the other low-paid, precarious occupations where women and people of color predominate.\n“For those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,” vowed candidate Trump at the Conservative Political Action Conference early in 2023. But it is Trump himself who feels most wronged and betrayed, with women – the pussy-hatted protesters who overran Washington on the second day of his first administration, the sex worker Stormy Daniels, who publicly poked fun at his self-celebrated endowment, the magazine writer E Jean Carroll, awarded tens of millions of dollars in damages for his sexual assault and defamation – perhaps the greatest wrongdoers and traitors. Even Melania is no longer pretending to like him.\nLike his woman-hating followers, this man, who has used his wealth and his body to impose his will on women, feels sorely victimized by them. Now he has more power than any other man in the world to exact his revenge.\n-\nJudith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five books.

    "raw_text": "Twelve days before Donald Trump took office, Charlie Kirk, media personality and rightwing activist, complained on his eponymous show about the presence of American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters at emergency press briefings for the Los Angeles fires. Another rightwing activist, Christopher Rufo, took his cue on X, calling interpreters “wild human gesticulators” who turned briefings into a “farce”. The rightwing theorist and Origins of Woke author Richard Hanania, quote-tweeting Rufo, declared ASL interpretation an “absurdity”.\nAround this time, Elon Musk was skulking around the platform, campaigning to bring back the R-word. Use of the slur tripled on X after his post.\nTo those with less knowledge of disability history, these attacks might read as gross, but ultimately toothless. Activists, though, quickly sounded the alarm: the incoming administration would be coming for disabled people. “To the deaf community, the fight for accessibility is nothing new,” said Sara Miller, deaf educator and community advocate.\nHowever, Miller said she had seen a burgeoning movement against accessibility from conservatives with large platforms, including during the first Trump administration, when the National Association of the Deaf had to sue to have ASL interpreters during 2020 Covid briefings. “But when looking at the history of the first term of [the Trump] administration, and currently how diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) is being targeted, it’s not hard to see the correlation.”\nManufacturing cultural outrage to justify policy that would have previously been considered too cruel or damaging is a staple of the far-right playbook: most recently, the US has seen the move used to bolster book bans and outlaw Black history and gender-affirming care.\nThe play-by-play is always the same: social media followers take their marching orders, hurling discontent at the specified targets and regurgitating talking points. Eventually, the ideas become so ubiquitous they are adopted by politicians who use them to engage their base. Finally, the talking point becomes the policy itself, and politicians claim they have a mandate from the people to justify stripping away the rights of the marginalized.\nFast forward to 21 January 2025, when the accessibility page and all ASL content were removed from the White House website. Then, real-life interpreters were removed from the White House and across multiple federal agencies whose accommodations divisions were dismantled under Trump’s anti-DEIA orders.\nAlongside “diversity” and “women”, words like “accessibility” and “disability” have also been listed as grounds to flag or reject grant applications at the National Science Foundation, sparking concerns at other federal agencies and research institutions. And last week, the Department of Justice, which is charged with enforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), began to rescind key guidance, justifying the move by suggesting that accessibility is the reason for cost-of-living increases.\nSimultaneously, disabled children’s right to education is under fire. On 20 March, Trump signed an executive order to dismantle the Department of Education. Earlier in March, secretary of education, Linda McMahon, laid off over 1,300 people – nearly half the department – eliminating seven regional offices, large swaths of the department’s office of civil rights, as well as parts of the office of special education and rehabilitative services, though she had previously said those programs wouldn’t be affected. Twenty-one attorneys general filed a suit over the layoffs, arguing they were “illegal and unconstitutional”.\nThe education department funds early intervention and post-high school transition programs, and organizations like the American Printing House for the Blind and the Special Olympics. It also enforces the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the law that gives disabled kids the right to a “free and appropriate public education”. A child’s needs and services are documented in a legally binding agreement known as an Individualized Education Program, providing services like speech, physical and occupational therapy, and the use of specialized curriculum. Accommodations like closed captions, ASL interpreters, ramps and elevator keys, braille materials, preferential seating, audio books, use of a laptop or notetaker, and movement breaks can also be included.\nWithout these plans, disabled students may be inside the classroom, but they will not be meaningfully educated. Now the director of the office of special education position is vacant.\nDisabled people’s rights in other government spaces are also under fire. The lawsuit Texas v Becerra calls on a judge to declare section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 – which prevents the US government, or any entity that receives federal money, from discriminating on the basis of disability – unconstitutional. If the law is struck down, basic rights and services for disabled people, like seeking treatment at a hospital or Medicaid-accepting doctor’s office, being hired to the federal workforce, entering a government building and more will be at risk.\nThe canary in the coalmine\nHistorically, the way a government treats disabled people can be an early indicator of its broader social policy intentions.\nFor instance, disabled people are the proverbial canary in the coalmine with respect to the effects of global climate change.\n“Disabled and older people face significant barriers during these disasters, such as the inability to evacuate … or [access] important information,” said the MacArthur Fellow and Disability Visibility author Alice Wong via email. “As someone who is ventilator dependent, power outages are a concern during storms or wildfires that trigger rolling blackouts. I am privileged enough to have some backup batteries but they would not last more than one to two days. I guffaw when federal and state agencies give advice such as preparing a go bag and stocking extra medications because that is simply out of reach for many disabled people.”\nRecent wildfires in Los Angeles provide one such example in the tragic story of Anthony Mitchell and his son, both wheelchair users, who called for help, but were instead left to die.\nLeaving disabled people behind is not new to the American political landscape; the US has a history of eradicating the disabled. Eugenics – the pseudoscientific belief that humans should breed for “desirable traits” and suppress the undesirable ones – rose to popularity in the US and globally during the late 19th century.\nThe first eugenics-based law in the world was passed in the US: Indiana’s 1907 Act to Prevent the Procreation of Confirmed Criminals, Idiots, Imbeciles and Rapists targeted disabled people in state schools and institutions and incarcerated people by mandating sterilization for “criminals, idiots, rapists and imbeciles in state custody”. The Nazis would go on to praise the US’s codified eugenics and racism in their 1934 handbook.\nIn Germany, the convergence of two mass-disabling events – the Spanish flu pandemic and the first world war – wreaked economic strife, the rationing of food and medicine, and overcrowding in institutions and long-term hospitals.\nCalls from the German eugenicists to stamp out what they called “life unworthy of life” began in the 1920s, even before Hitler came to power.\nBy 1933, the magazine Volk und Rasse was publishing a variety of eugenics propaganda, including a political cartoon featuring images of large moneybags labeled “a slow learner”, “the educable mentally ill”, and “blind or deaf-born schoolchildren” bore the caption: “This illustration depicts the burden of maintaining the socially unfit.”\nThat same year, a law called for compulsory sterilization of those with “hereditary diseases” including deafness, blindness, schizophrenia, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, chronic alcoholism and a host of other conditions. A 1935 expansion of the law required mandatory abortions on the fetus of a parent with one of the listed conditions. Approximately 400,000 disabled people were sterilized in Germany and annexed territories during this period.\nMore extensive propaganda campaigns declaring disabled people as “useless eaters” were launched through various media in Germany. The arts, including in literature, documentaries and narrative film, posed a solution: mercy killings. As Mark P Mostert outlines in his 2002 article “Useless Eaters,” one particularly popular 1941 movie, I Accuse, caused a spike in the belief that euthanasia was an act of kindness toward disabled people. In the film, a a man euthanizes his beautiful, disabled wife as an act of love, asking the court: “Would you, if you were a cripple, want to vegetate forever?” The court acquits; the movie’s final scenes declare “love is medicine”.\nSupport for euthanasia among Germans exploded, writes Mostert, and the first disabled people were euthanized at the behest of their families, who had bought the party line that killing their loved ones would be an act of grace. In 1939, Hitler created an advisory committee to oversee the state’s first official program for the killing of disabled children, whose murders began en masse that year.\nThe program quickly expanded to encompass multiple killing sites, as well as disabled adults across German territories, through the program Aktion T4. The Nazi gas chambers were perfected using disabled people. There, officials first created the cover story that “patients” were being sent to take a shower, where they were poisoned with carbon monoxide gas and sent to crematoriums. When carbon monoxide proved too slow, the methodology for gassing via cyanide-based Zyklon B was tested and fine-tuned on disabled people.\nProtests from Catholic bishops stopped T4’s public programming in 1941, but by then the gassing of prisoners at Chelmno and the Wannsee Conference to establish official policy of mass extermination against Jewish people were only months away; the T4 mandate, too, continued more quietly until 1945. The program is estimated to have killed about 250,000 disabled people.\nThe US supreme court’s 1927 decision to uphold forcible sterilization in Virginia has never been overturned. It remains legal in at least 31 states and Washington DC to forcibly sterilize a disabled person.\nIt is also legal to pay disabled people less than the federal minimum wage for their work: businesses that receive a certification from the Department of Labor to operate as a “sheltered workshop” pay their disabled employees far less than the legal minimum, at an average of $3.34 an hour.\nAdditionally, many disabled people today don’t have meaningful marriage equality. To calculate social security disability insurance, the government “factors in all facets of your ‘income’ to calculate how much they are willing to give you”, said the writer and journalist Kristen Lopez in an email. “If you get married, they factor in that person’s income and if your partner makes too much you’re threatened with making less money or being denied services at all.”\nHow ableism backfires\nAbleism is a brand of bigotry that carries few consequences in the American mainstream. Often, disabled people must argue that it exists at all.\nAdditionally, due to the intersectional nature of disability across race, gender, socioeconomic status and every other classification, that a person’s oppression compounds under a white supremacist system is often lost in the discussion.\n“I have seen individuals working in DEI spaces who openly reject disability work as being part of their purview,” said Wyatte Hall, an assistant professor of public health services at the University of Rochester. “I have consistently seen other forms of bigotry be taken quite seriously while ableism, and audism in deaf-related contexts, have been allowed to more or less flourish.”\nBut ableism eventually backfires on everybody.\nThe Trump administration’s attack on disability rights and the collective shrug by non-disabled people could result in dangerous and far-reaching consequences. If a judge were to declare section 504 unconstitutional, it could set a legal precedent for dismantling other civil rights protections, which are also known as “spending clause statutes”, including the Civil Rights Act.\n“There are other spending clause statutes that cover race and sex discrimination. So any attack around spending clause may affect these other statutes down the road,” said Claudia Center, the legal director of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, in an online community briefing in February.\nSecuring change through activism\nThere is a long history of skilled, effective activism by disabled people to leverage non-disabled people’s discomfort around disability in the fight for equal rights and legal protections. Judy Heumann and fellow disabled activists first secured the signature of section 504 in 1977 by staging sit-ins across the country. The 26 days in San Francisco’s health education and welfare office remains the longest occupation of a government building in US history.\nMembers of the grassroots organization Adapt have often used their wheelchairs to create blockades in protest of inaccessible transportation, conditions in nursing homes and other disability-centric causes, forcing security and police officers to contend with the logistics and fears of interacting with disabled bodies.\nIn the 1988 Deaf President Now protests at Gallaudet University, students took advantage of the misconception of disabled innocence and hot-wired school buses to block university gates, shutting down the school until their demands for self-determination – a deaf university president and majority-deaf board – were met.\n“As we’re seeing with the Republicans’ attempt to eliminate section 504, the activism of the 1970s is still needed,” said Lopez, the writer and journalist, referencing the physical and disruptive nature of those historic protests.\nMany battles are already being waged in the legal system, with disabled and non-disabled lawyers and organizations like the National Association for the Deaf, ACLU, and Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund working together on legal filings as pushback.\nOutside the courtroom, activists are running public awareness campaigns on social media, encouraging people to call their representatives and attorneys general.\n“The most practical thing non-disabled people can do is stay informed and recognize the power of their voice,” said Jordan Christian LeVan, a disability advocate and founder of the educational advocacy organization Fighting for My Voice. “In our current climate, the last thing those in power want is for people to understand the impact of their advocacy. Contact your representatives, show up at school board meetings and support disabled-led organizations. Call out policies that harm disabled people. Your voice matters more than you want to believe.”\nBoth Lopez and LeVan noted the importance of including disability rights in broader coalitions seeking to push back against the current administration. “You shouldn’t have to personally know a disabled person to care about disabled issues,” said Lopez. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions … that’s the start of a necessary dialogue. We need allies!”\n“Disabled people were not always marginalized; we were incorporated into society in the ancient past,” said Dr Alexandra F Morris, a lecturer in classical studies at the University of Lincoln who studies disability in ancient Egypt. “We have the means to create and return to a more equitable society if we wish to, but it is our modern-day thinking that sees disability as marginalized … and a burden.”\nAfter the proposed Americans With Disabilities Act stalled in Congress in 1990 (in part due to opposition from evangelical Christian lobbies), the legislation was spurred forward in part by a protest known as the Capitol Crawl. Disabled people abandoned their mobility devices and dragged themselves up the steps of the Capitol building by hand. The ADA was signed into law a few months later.\n“If you live long enough, chances are you’ll experience disability yourself,” said LeVan. “While we’ve made huge strides in disability rights over the past few decades – those protections are under attack. If we don’t fight back now, it sets a dangerous precedent for the future.”\n-\nSara Nović is a deaf organizer and the author of the novels True Biz and Girl at War"

    "raw_text": "Nigel Farage has been accused of “ugly” and “destructive” rhetoric after announcing plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and pledging to pay despotic regimes such as the Taliban to take them back.\nUnveiling Reform UK’s “Operation Restoring Justice” at a combative press conference in Oxford, Farage said he would rip up the UK’s postwar human rights commitments, contained in a range of international conventions, to deport “absolutely anyone” – including women and children – arriving by small boat.\nCalling asylum seekers a threat to national security and to British women, he claimed his plans would stop Channel crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of billions of pounds”.\nDowning Street accused Farage of not being serious about his plans, but in a sign of how Reform has set the tone for public debate, the prime minister’s spokesperson refused to criticise his references to irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge” or his prediction that Britain is “not far away from major civil disorder”.\nPushed on whether it would be a good idea to sign a returns deal with Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, as Farage proposed, the spokesperson said the government was “not going to take anything off the table”.\nThe Conservatives merely accused Reform UK of “reheating and recycling” Tory plans.\nThe Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “We really are through the looking-glass now. Nigel Farage pretending to be patriotic while pledging to rip up Britain’s proud record of leading the world on human rights.\n“As we’ve seen across history, his populist playbook is ugly, powerful and incredibly destructive. We know where it will lead if we don’t stop it.”\nLaura Smith, a co-head of legal at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said: “If today feels like a Rubicon moment, it’s because it is. We are hearing proposals that would tear through centuries of British legal tradition – from the Magna Carta to the Human Rights Act – with barely any resistance from those who should be defending those values.\n“The ban on torture is absolute and fundamental; it cannot be bargained away. That mainstream parties have failed to push back is deeply alarming. This isn’t about migration policy any more, it’s about whether we still value the basic human rights and freedoms that define a democratic society. Now more than ever, we must fight against the normalisation of this rhetoric.”\nFarage argued that “over three-quarters” of small-boat arrivals were “young undocumented males” from “cultures entirely different from ours” who were “unlikely to assimilate” and “pose a risk to women and girls”.\nAsked about some of his language, the Downing Street spokesperson said: “We have to recognise the strength of feeling about this,” and he stressed “the serious, practical action” that the government was taking to address the issue.\nHis criticism was instead focused on how leaving the European convention on human rights (ECHR), as proposed by Farage, was unrealistic because the convention underpinned key international agreements on trade, security and migration and the Good Friday agreement.\nAs well as leaving the ECHR, Reform’s leadership said it would repeal the Human Rights Act and disapply the 1951 refugee contention and the UN convention against torture as well as the Council of Europe’s anti-trafficking convention. Legal experts said such moves would not be a panacea.\nAdam Wagner KC, a leading human rights barrister, said: “As much as there’s this focus on international law, as if international law is the thing that’s stopping people being sent, for example, to be tortured in other countries, I think they might find that the British courts, which I think they still quite like at the moment over international courts, have something important to say about people’s rights. A lot of the convention rights come from British common law rights.”\nFarage was unable to name a single RAF base to be converted into secure detention facilities, despite insisting they would be central to his plans. He could not explain how Reform’s scheme would be funded, beyond claiming costs would be a fraction of independent estimates.\nHe offered no detail on how Reform would secure deportation agreements with countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan, many of which have no return treaties with the UK and are considered unsafe by British courts.\nGeorge Peretz KC, the chair of the Society of Labour Lawyers, said: “The Reform party’s policy is simply not rooted in reality. They want to institute a mass deportation programme with no real or workable idea of where people would be deported to.\n“Reform’s policy would require a returns policy to be negotiated with regimes such as the Taliban and Iran, and may, by their own admission, involve paying those regimes to do so. Which is impractical and extremely concerning, as well as unlawful (as our own courts ruled in the Rwanda case).”\nKolbassia Haoussou, the director of survivor leadership at Freedom from Torture, said: “Men, women and children are coming to the UK looking for safety. They are fleeing the unimaginable horrors of torture in places like Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran. These laws were created in the aftermath of the second world war to protect us all. If Britain were to abandon this legacy it would hand repressive regimes around the world a gift and undermine the promise to defend our shared right to live a life free from torture.”\nFarage claims the programme would deport up to 600,000 asylum seekers in a single parliament, yet the costings remain opaque.\nA report by the Centre for Migration Control, which produced costings alongside the MP Rupert Lowe but is not led by him, estimated that a near-identical mass deportation scheme would cost £47.5bn.\nFarage insists his plan would provide the same scale of removals for £10bn, but he offered no operational blueprint or independent evidence to support the claim."

    "raw_text": "When 12-year-old Rose learned about the Bristol bus boycott in her history class, she felt an immense sense of pride. She knew there was a civil rights movement in the US, but wasn’t aware of the UK’s own struggle for racial justice.\n“I’ve felt quite proud that there were big stands here as well,” she says. Her schoolmate Ruqiiya, also 12, agrees and spoke of her frustration of initially struggling to find more information about the boycott online. They both love learning about it in class.\nBoth students attend Stoke Newington school in the east London borough of Hackney, which is leading a nationwide movement to reform their curriculum so it better reflects the achievements of black and minority ethnic people and addresses the legacy of colonialism.\nThe diverse and anti-racist curriculum, titled the Diverse Curriculum – the Black Contribution, was developed by teachers and local council staff just over a year ago and provides students with nine new six-week lessons on subjects including the Windrush generation, diversity in science and activism.\nThe free resource has proven successful, with more than 2,000 schools across the country signing up.\nOrlene Badu, from Hackney Education, who led the development of the project, said there is a misconception that decolonising school curriculums means taking subjects out or not sticking to the national curriculum. The programme from Hackney shows schools how to better utilise the curriculum to ensure what they teach is more reflective of the positive contributions of different communities.\n“Children for such a long time in this country have only learned about enslavement, and not about the black contribution. There is a positive contribution and it’s really important that everyone knows because it’s part of our national story,” Badu said.\n“I’ve had a lot of people saying in my class that they really like history. I think it’s underrated. It seems like a boring subject, but actually, if you’re learning about fun stuff like that, it’s really cool,” Rose said.\nAnntoinette Bramble, councillor, deputy mayor of Hackney, and cabinet member for education, young people and children’s social care, said it was important that the diverse curriculum was embedded across subjects and that they didn’t confine learning about black history to a single month.\n“So you’re constantly evoking, challenging but, ultimately, empowering young minds to think about how they reshape their future and the world that they go out into,” Bramble said.\nThe groundswell of support for the curriculum across the country shows the desperate need for a resource such as this, Bramble said.\nShe is keen to work closely with the national government to implement it on a national scale. The political will, however, is currently not there. The government’s Sewell report on Race and Ethnic Disparities in the UK pointed to “negative” demands to decolonise the curriculum – warning against “banning white authors” and “token expressions of Black achievement”.\n“This curriculum is empowering for children that are white, black and of all diverse backgrounds, because it’s part of British history. It’s telling some of those untold stories that weren’t told. It’s not to replace history, it is not to eradicate history, it’s to add to it,” Bramble said. “It builds tolerance, it builds understanding, it builds cohesion and it gives all children a new sense of identity of where we’ve come, but, more importantly, where we’re going.”\nThe students appear to agree. “If you get taught things from a young age, they just kind of stick with you,” Ruqiiya said. “And if you teach the younger generation, then they’ll keep what you have taught them. And then they’ll go on to bring change.”\nBoth students say it’s nice to see where movements and ideas, particularly ones they don’t agree with, originate from. They believe it’s vital to hold on to these “untold stories” as they grow up.\n“It’s kind of like a string that you connect. So that the history doesn’t just evaporate out of existence,” Ruqiiya said."

    "raw_text": "It’s often only when something breaks that you learn how it works. Occasionally, I use the funiculars dotted around Lisbon to quickly navigate steep, sweat-inducing hills. They don’t feel dangerous; a touch precarious, perhaps, but only because the fin-de-siecle contraptions, with their angular poise against the steep inclines and narrow wooden benches, seem so unlikely. But I hadn’t thought about how they actually function until the tragic accident at the Elevador da Glória last week: two carriages at either end of the climb, connected under the track by a haulage wire in perfect balance, provide a counterweight to propel each other, with the help of an electric cable overhead.\nLast Wednesday evening, during rush hour, a cable connecting two of those carriages reportedly disconnected, causing the higher one to careen downhill, derailing and crashing into a nearby building at high speed. Sixteen people were killed with 20 more injured; five are still in a critical condition.\nAccording to preliminary observations by Portuguese officials, the funicular’s scheduled maintenance plan was up to date and no anomalies had been discovered in the cable or braking systems before the crash. But two separate investigations remain under way. There also continues to be much debate about underlying issues at play, all of which is feeding into the city and its discontents.\nAn early line from Público newspaper – “Cable breakage exposes fragile maintenance of Lisbon elevator ‘overloaded’ with tourists” – made me think about how much of the global coverage of the incident talked about the funicular only as a tourist attraction. Some of this is natural given that the victims included people from the US to South Korea. But five Portuguese people also died: the carriage’s brakeman and four employees of Santa Casa da Misericórdia, a charitable organisation that has an office nearby.\nOn Thursday, Público also reported that the funiculars’ maintenance regime had been reduced since Carris, the city’s transit company, outsourced the work to private contractors more than a decade ago. (Although it has not responded to this claim, Carris has insisted that the maintenance protocols for the funicular were “scrupulously followed”.) Mensagem, an independent publication, resurfaced a 2021 interview with a retiring Carris engineer bemoaning the apparent loss of institutional knowledge as the number of technical staff was slimmed down. Lisboa Para Pessoas, another online publication, ran a piece defiantly declaring: “The Elevador da Glória ‘accident’ is, in fact, the ‘accident’ of neoliberal Lisbon: but this should also be seen as a symptom of burnout, a symptom of a city in burnout.”\nIt all speaks to a sense of a city that is overburdened with tourists and underserving its residents. If you have ever taken Lisbon’s famed trams, you will have endured long queues and crowded carriages. Earlier this year, Carris even explored having separate queues for residents and visitors: the funiculars and trams aren’t ornamental, some people need to go places. In a grim twist, anecdotal evidence at the weekend pointed to trams denuded of passengers in the aftermath of the crash.\nAny large city is a fragile thing: tragedy can strike out of the blue through a random accident, structural neglect or matters more nefarious. This seems particularly so in a beautiful old city such as Lisbon, which exists in wildly varying states of preservation and dereliction. On the same day as the Glória crash, the side of an old residential building collapsed in the rapidly gentrifying Graça neighbourhood. Thankfully, no one was badly hurt but people have been made homeless, at least temporarily. It has been reported that the empty lot next door was in the process of being developed into expensive apartments.\nWhen parts of Lisbon break down, you start to see how the system is working, and who it is working for. Portugal responded to the 2008 financial crash by relaxing rent laws, and creating incentives for international visitors and investors, leading to a huge boom in tourism and real estate. (As a relative newcomer to the city, I can’t absolve myself from my role in these problems either.) This relentless focus on building hotels and attracting foreign investment at the expense of everything else shows little sign of slowing.\nAs a friend, an architect and academic, wrote, tourism and economic liberalisation have material consequences for a city. When old technologies and buildings are preserved, the knowledge and care that created them needs to be maintained too. While dilapidated buildings have been rehabilitated as a result of the post-2008 policies, those once living in them have often been left behind.\nAt the end of last week, the city was, and was not, returning to normality. At the scene of the accident on Friday evening, flowers and tributes had been left. TV news teams filmed while more people like me stood around looking helpless, snapping the odd photo. Farther up the hill, workers were clearing the last bits of debris from the crash site. Traffic rumbled as usual and tourists continued to stream by.\nAlmost opposite the Glória line is another funicular going up a different steep hill. Its two carriages were sitting dormant: all funiculars have been temporarily shut as a precaution. At the top of this hill, the gates at the entrance to the Lavra funicular were closed, and someone had left a single red flower with a green stem. It made me think of the red carnation, the symbol of the Portuguese revolution that overthrew the dictatorship 51 years ago. Every 25 April, people march down Lisbon’s central boulevard carrying carnations: the promise of a better, fairer country for all. It’s also a reminder that wherever you live, such an ideal cannot be taken for granted, it needs to be maintained, replenished and fought for every day.\n-\nLarry Ryan is a freelance writer and editor\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "raw_text": "A cable linking two carriages snapped shortly before Wednesday’s funicular crash in Lisbon that killed 16 people, accident inspectors have said in a report.\nAn operator tried to apply emergency brakes but failed to prevent the derailment, investigators added.\nThe findings were published on Saturday by Portugal’s air and rail accident investigations bureau (GPIAAF) into the incident that left at least 20 others injured with five people in a critical condition.\nA scheduled visual inspection had been carried out on the morning of the accident but the area where the cable broke was “not visible without dismantling” and the rest of the mechanism was functioning properly, the report added.\nThe carriages of the city’s iconic Glória funicular had travelled no more than six metres when they “suddenly lost the balancing force of the connecting cable”.\nThe vehicle’s brake‑guard immediately “activated the pneumatic brake as well as the manual brake” but the measures “had no effect in reducing the vehicle’s speed”, the Office for the Prevention and Investigation of Aircraft Accidents and Railway Accidents said.\nAccording to the initial findings, the Elevador da Glória crashed into a building at a speed of 60km/h (37mph) and the whole incident happened in 50 seconds.\n“According to the evidence observed so far, the scheduled maintenance plan was up to date, and a scheduled visual inspection had been conducted on the morning of the accident, which detected no anomalies in the vehicles’ cable or braking systems,” the agency said.\nThe statement added that the cable was only 337 days into its expected 600-day operational life and it remains unclear how many passengers were travelling in the carriage – which can hold about 40 people – and how many were on the street.\nTwo separate investigations are now under way into the accident: one carried out by the accident investigators’ office and another by the prosecutors’ office. The GPIAAF said the two investigations were entirely independent of each other and it will publish a preliminary report into the accident within 45 days.\nInvestigators had already announced that 11 foreign nationals were among the fatalities. Three Britons, two South Koreans, two Canadians, one Frenchwoman, one Swiss, one American and one Ukrainian were identified among the victims.\nThe families of a British couple killed, Kayleigh Smith, 36, and William Nelson, 44, paid tribute to them and said they were “heartbroken”. In a statement issued by police on Saturday, Smith’s family said: “Kayleigh was loved by family and friends for her wit and humour, her kind and caring nature came to the fore in her work as a funeral operative.\n“She was also a talented theatre director and had just completed a master’s degree. They both leave family and friends heartbroken.”\nIn the same police statement, Nelson’s brother, who was not named, said: “Words cannot begin to describe how our family and friends are feeling right now but here is the best attempt. This week, due to a tragic accident in Lisbon, Portugal, we lost Will Nelson, who was not just my big brother but everyone’s.\n“He was always kind, selfless, and protective, and the world does not feel right or normal without him. He was and has always been my hero, and we will miss you always. Love you, rest in peace you legend.”"

    "raw_text": "Over the past decade, Lisbon has undergone a dramatic transformation – from one of the most affordable capitals in Europe to the most unaffordable.\nBetween 2014 and 2024, house prices in the city rose by 176%, and by more than 200% in its central historic districts. The home price to income ratio, a key indicator of housing affordability, reflects this shift with stark clarity: today, Lisbon tops Europe’s housing unaffordability rankings. This trend extends to the national level. In 2015, Portugal ranked 22nd out of 27 EU countries for housing unaffordability. Today, it ranks first. In a country where 60% of taxpayers earn less than €1,000 a month, finding a rental below that price in the Portuguese capital is only possible if you’re willing to live in 20 sq metres – or less.\nTo understand how Lisbon reached this point, we need to look back to the years following the 2008 global financial crisis. As part of its shock plan to revive the economy, Portugal embraced a strategy of aggressive liberalisation, aiming to put Lisbon – and the country – on the global map for real estate investment and tourism. The government implemented a familiar neoliberal formula: rental laws were relaxed, making evictions easier and tenancy agreements shorter; generous tax incentives were introduced for non-resident buyers, including the now controversial “golden visa” and “non-habitual resident” programmes; and investment funds were actively encouraged to enter the property market, benefiting from additional tax exemptions.\nAt the same time, both the hotel industry and the short-term rental sector were promoted, alongside initiatives to attract visitors, digital nomads, international students, and transient young professionals from other countries. In the historic centre of Lisbon, Airbnb-style rentals have reached dramatic levels: half of all homes hold a short-term rental licence, and in the most tourist-saturated neighbourhoods, that figure climbs to 70 out of every 100. When measured against the city’s population, the number of short-term rentals in Lisbon represents a density six times higher than in Barcelona and 3.5 times higher than in London. Meanwhile, the number of hotels has tripled since 2010 – from around 100 to 300 – and the city council has already approved plans for around 50 more. This is a trend playing out across European cities and in southern Europe residents are pushing back as seen in the recent protests.\nThese changes happened in a global context of low interest rates in which affluent people increasingly turned to housing as a place to park their savings. For this type of individual investor, buying properties in Lisbon was a win-win: they could acquire assets to use as second homes in an attractive destination and obtain rental income while they are not in the city, while benefiting from both the appreciation of the property value and tax benefits. Storing of wealth in housing drives up prices as investors are willing to pay premium prices for safe assets – the median price of transactions made by foreign buyers in Lisbon is 82% higher than the price paid by domestic buyers.\nBefore 2008, gentrification was largely absent from many central Lisbon neighbourhoods – areas primarily inhabited by poor, elderly residents living in deteriorating buildings. Investment certainly brought building rehabilitation, but it didn’t translate into residential stability. Despite the improvements, the centre of the city lost 25% of its population between 2011 and 2021. Across the municipality, of the dwellings built or renovated between during this period, only 56.5% serve as primary residences. The rest are either vacant, used as second homes, or converted into short-term rentals.\nAll this contradicts the neoliberal supply and demand story as the escalation of property prices is not linked to an actual demand for homes to live in and the formation of new households. Instead, what we see is that Lisbon is now on the radar of investors who use housing as a financial asset: a process where real estate is produced not to meet residential needs, but to maximise returns. In a context shaped by a flexible rental law, local landlords have capitalised on this shift, engaging in rentier practices by steadily raising rents and extracting increasing value from a shrinking pool of habitable homes.\nThe result is a city that welcomes foreign wealth but excludes many of its own citizens, prioritising the desires of global consumers over the needs of local communities. The current housing crisis reflects a stark disconnect between wages and property prices – with housing costs approaching those of global cities in a country where salaries remain among the lowest in Europe. Beyond tourists, central Lisbon is now primarily occupied by a transnational class of young, mobile professionals – the new gentrifiers. Meanwhile, locals are increasingly being pushed out or forced to adapt by renting rooms instead of entire flats. At the same time, a growing share of household income is being consumed by housing costs, deepening social inequality and widening the gap between landlords and the broader population.\nContrary to the neoliberal myth that the market alone can meet the needs of the population, Lisbon offers yet another example of market failure – at least for those who see housing as a place to live with dignity.\n-\nAgustín Cocola-Gant is a research fellow at the Institute of Geography and Spatial Planning, Centre of Geographical Studies, University of Lisbon\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "António Azevedo was in central Lisbon early on Wednesday evening, waiting to gather enough tourists for a ride in his tuk-tuk, when he heard what sounded like dozens of glass containers being dropped into rubbish trucks.\nThe driver looked around Restauradores Square but saw no trucks, only smoke rising from the lower station of the Elevador da Glória funicular railway, 100 metres from where his vehicle was parked.\nAzevedo and other local business owners dashed to the scene to find that one of the Glória trams had derailed and crashed into a building in Avenida da Liberdade, Lisbon’s main artery.\nShocked, disoriented and unsure of what to do amid all the screaming and crying, the helpers began picking up metal pieces from the ground, wondering if they should try to lift what remained of the car’s main structure in case survivors were trapped beneath it.\nOne fellow rescuer passed a bleeding young boy to Azevedo, who held him as he cried for his father. Soon after, police and firefighters arrived at the scene and ordered Azevedo and the others not to touch or move anything.\n“I remember looking around – the crying and the screaming gave way to complete silence,” said the 45-year-old driver. “There was a mountain of bodies that were not asking for help. They no longer moved; some were torn apart. I had never seen anything like it.”\nMohammad Farid rushed down from his souvenir store in Restauradores Square to help. But for many, it was already too late.\n“We wanted to rescue people, to save lives,” Farid said. “But no one was asking for help because they were dead. They were dead in seconds.”\nBy Thursday morning, the scene of the accident – in which 16 people died and 21 were injured – was filled with flowers and candles to honour the dead and mark the national day of mourning declared by the Portuguese government.\nThe list of people caught up in the disaster reflected its international dimension. As well as Portuguese citizens, those being treated in hospital included people from Canada, Cape Verde, France, Germany, Italy, Morocco, South Korea, Spain and Switzerland. Prosecutors said on Thursday evening that the dead included five Portuguese citizens, two Koreans and one Swiss national.\nA group of local people standing close by the site were discussing what could have caused the tragedy. In the 1970s, Argentina Pereira, now 80, used to work in the Suisso Atlântico Hotel in Rua da Glória, where the tram derailed.\nShe talked of the strain the funicular had been under since Lisbon began to establish itself as one of Europe’s biggest tourist magnets over the past decade.\n“I used to take the funicular four times a day [in the 1970s],” she said. “It was a beautiful time, and a different time. Now they allow more than 40 people aboard, but back then, no more than 20 people could travel at the same time. I think 40 is probably too much, and if they want it that way, they should do periodic inspections every two weeks.”\nAzevedo also felt the tragedy should lead to increased checks.\n“I think that cities that receive a lot of tourists must guarantee high safety [standards] with this kind of infrastructure,” he said. “This is old infrastructure, and someone needs to answer for what happened.”\nAlthough Carris, the municipal public transport company that operates the service, said “all maintenance protocols” had been carried out – including daily inspections and monthly and weekly service programmes – some visitors to Lisbon said they had been put off by the appearance of the funicular.\nJohn Heron, a 75-year-old Australian who was on holiday in the Portuguese capital with his wife, Brenda, said he had thought the trams looked “dodgy” when he spotted them from the top of the hill of Rua da Glória a few days before the accident.\n“In Australia, we have very high-quality regulation systems, and I am not so sure the same is true here in Portugal and for a lot of older infrastructures in Europe,” he said. “When I first saw the Glória funicular, it looked very unsafe, but I am not an engineer; it was just a feeling. When I saw the news, I thought, ‘Lucky we ended up staying at the hotel yesterday afternoon, or who knows if we would have ended up deciding to take the ride’.”\nOthers were also counting their blessings. Cristián Morgado, a 31-year-old tourist from neighbouring Spain, had been planning to ride the route on Wednesday afternoon with his partner, Soraya Navarro. In the end, they decided to do it in the morning.\n“Since we saw what happened, we can’t stop thinking that it could have been us if we hadn’t changed our minds,” said Navarro, 30.\nDespite Wednesday’s crash, which Portugal’s prime minister, Luís Montenegro, described as “one of the biggest tragedies in our recent history”, Morgado doubts tourists will be put off from visiting Lisbon.\n“I don’t think this will affect tourism much,” he said. “Spain has a similar situation with overtourism, and now we are having a serious issue with pickpocketing, and foreigners know and that hasn’t stopped them.”\nIn a few weeks, he said, foreigners would probably have forgotten about all this. “Portuguese people won’t, but tourists will.”"

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump’s thuggish campaign to bully his way to the Nobel peace prize should not be the cause for the committee to reject him. There are many more substantial grounds that render him patently unqualified to receive the award.\nAmong the numerous reasons that make him one of the least deserving people in the world who should be honored, he has single-handedly destroyed the United States Agency for International Development, which has saved hundreds of millions of people from hunger and disease, and promoted democracy and the rule of law around the world. In an executive order issued on his inauguration day, 20 January, Trump slandered USAID as “not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values” and claimed that its workers “serve to destabilize world peace”.\nThat act of malice by itself should be sufficient to erase Trump from the longest long list.\nClearly, the worthiest candidate for the Nobel peace prize, whether its name was submitted before the deadline or not, is USAID. Since its founding under John F Kennedy in 1961, USAID has supported extensive programs on global health, food security, education and democratic development that, by addressing the root causes of instability and poverty, had promoted a more free, peaceful and prosperous world for 64 years until Trump destroyed it.\nAs a general rule, there should be no shame attached to an organized effort to win the prize by Trump or others. Trump’s lobbying, though, is stained, as is much else about him, by perverse statecraft that has fostered conflict where none previously existed and his unquenchable need for cult-like worship.\nSeveral world leaders, such as Benjamin Netanyahu, have written in support of Trump’s nomination at his behest, cynically calculating that it would curry favor for their own often nefarious and warlike purposes. Trump personally pressured India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, to write a letter based on the lie that it was Trump who had “solved” a recent military conflict with Pakistan. Modi was alienated by the improper request. After his refusal to submit a false statement, Trump imposed a 50% tariff on India, which sent Modi flying into the arms of China. There is no existing international prize for this sort of willfully destructive behavior.\nThe encomiums from Trump’s closest aides hailing him as the best candidate are symptoms of the sycophancy that is the eternal mark of authoritarian regimes. Fitting the historical pattern, obsequiousness within a cult of personality substitutes for honesty, fact and evidence. Trump punishes and purges forthright counsel, suppresses factual intelligence and expert information that is not falsified or distorted to achieve predetermined results, and dismisses evidence regarding medicine, the environment and energy derived from the scientific method.\nThe tenor of unctuous servility was perfectly voiced by Steven Witkoff, Trump’s all-purpose international representative, speaking at an August cabinet meeting. “There’s only one thing I wish for,” he said, “that the Nobel committee finally gets its act together and realizes that you are the single finest candidate since this Nobel award was ever talked about.”\nThe phrasing of Witkoff’s praise is eerily reminiscent of the words uttered in the 1962 film The Manchurian Candidate by the character of Major Ben Marco, played by Frank Sinatra, who has been brainwashed as a prisoner of war held by the North Koreans. He repeats over and over again his admiration for an army sergeant from his unit who has been programmed to be a political assassin on behalf of both the communists and the American far right. “Raymond Shaw,” says Major Marco, “is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life.” In the movie, Shaw is awarded a prize – the Congressional Medal of Honor – based on the brainwashed testimony of his fellow soldiers.\n“No matter what I do, they won’t give it up and I’m not politicking for it,” Trump said. He suggested the efforts to grant him the prize were spontaneous: “I have a lot of people that are.” When he was handed a nomination letter that Netanyahu had submitted, Trump said: “They will never give me a Nobel peace prize. I deserve it.”\nBut Trump’s ludicrous hypocrisy about not pulling levers behind the curtain to solicit nomination also is not a conclusive reason to deny him the prize.\nTrump’s rancor about not receiving the prize that has not yet been awarded is exactly the same as his resentment that he did not get an Emmy for his reality TV show The Apprentice. For years he ranted: “Should have gotten it.” “I got screwed out of an Emmy.” “The Emmys are all politics.” “Con game.” “Irrelevant.” Then, like the Emmy, he claimed the 2020 presidential election was “rigged” and organized an insurrection to overthrow the democratic result. In his paranoid chain of things wrongly denied him, now it’s the Nobel. Fill in the blank.\nTrump’s longing for the prize also reflects his anger that Barack Obama received it. Trump’s animus against Obama about the Nobel followed his viciously contrived birther campaign. “Affirmative action,” said Trump. “Rigged.” “He had no idea why he got it.” “If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel prize given to me in 10 seconds.”\nThe diplomatic and political friction that Trump has gratuitously produced between the US and Norway with his offensive remarks should also not be the decisive issue that affects the judgment of the committee. In 2018, Trump said: “Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries … We should have more people from Norway.” His comment evoked nationwide disgust in Norway. “On behalf of Norway: thanks, but no thanks,” tweeted a politician representing Norway’s Conservative party.\nTrump’s recent 15% tariff levied on Norway, despite its insignificant trade deficit, has damaged its fishing industry. His antipathy toward renewable forms of energy, throwing the entire wind power industry into chaos, has cost the Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, which had an ongoing wind project off New York, about $1bn. In July, Trump called the Norwegian finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, the former head of Nato, “out of the blue”. “He wanted the Nobel prize – and to discuss tariffs,” a Norwegian newspaper reported. But none of these offensive, obnoxious and even malign actions should be dispositive in whether Trump receives the prize.\nThe reasons for denying him the award are much more fundamental and salient. His disqualification for the Nobel is not that he an inveterate liar, transparent faker and bungling schemer. It is that he meets other much more germane and dangerous criteria that were engraved for humankind epochs before the peace prize was ever conceived.\nWithin mere months since reassuming office Trump has become a harbinger across the globe of war, famine, disease and death. The standards by which he should be judged are those described in the Book of Revelation (6:1–8) by the appearance of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Trump rides or presumes to ride all of those dreaded emblems of destruction, which do not foretell any glorious coming of peace, a new heaven and new earth, or prophesy a cleansing moment for repentance, but instead carnage followed by dictatorship and plagues without end.\nSpecifically, rather than biblically, Trump has been an enabler of war. By his actions, he has supported Netanyahu’s offensive war for the complete ethnic cleansing and destruction of Gaza. Through his refusal to put conditions on $17.8bn in military assistance, Trump has made it possible for Netanyahu to ignore the advice of the Israeli army and intelligence leadership not to continue and expand that war.\nTrump has called for the US to “take over” and “own” Gaza to turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East”. This entity would generate profits through a US-led trusteeship, private investment in mega-construction projects and the “voluntary” relocation of Palestinians. Trump has held a White House meeting about a plan dubbed the Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust – or “Great Trust” – that envisions building the “Gaza Trump Riviera and Islands” and the “Elon Musk Manufacturing Zone” and paying Palestinians $5,000 to relocate. Under this plan, Trump would personally profit in violation of the emoluments clause of the constitution.\nOn Ukraine, Trump initially agreed to the European proposal for a ceasefire that would result in new sanctions if Vladimir Putin did not comply. But as soon as he was face to face with Putin at their summit in Alaska, Trump crumbled to take Putin’s side. The consequence has been the intensification of Russian bombing of Ukrainian civilian targets – as well as the European Union headquarters in Kyiv. Trump’s undermining of the ceasefire initiative was his latest gesture toward Putin of admiration and deference.\nThe Trump White House has said it will “not rule out” military action to seize Greenland, a semi-independent territory of Denmark, a Nato member. Meanwhile, Denmark reports that Trump has deployed political personnel close to the White House to Greenland to agitate for a US takeover and to prepare for possible US military operations there. On 28 August, Denmark’s foreign minister summoned the top US diplomat to warn the Trump administration against its covert influence operation.\nTrump has repeatedly laid claim to the territory of the Panama Canal Zone and threatened to use military force to seize it. These threats were apparently made in part to pressure the government of Panama to reduce or eliminate the bill for taxes on Trump Organization properties that they were accused of evading there. In 2017, a joint Reuters-NBC News investigation reported that the Trump Ocean Club International hotel and tower in Panama City was a front for international money laundering for narcotics trafficking, dubbed Narco-a-Lago. The Trump Organization asserted it bore no responsibility for the activity within its units.\nTrump has also repeatedly laid claim to the entire nation of Canada, another Nato member, to be occupied by and added to the United States as a single state. The White House has refused to rule out the use of military force for that purpose.\nOn 21 June, Trump ordered Operation Midnight Hammer, a surprise, coordinated air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, Isfahan and other locations. The mission involved B-2 bombers dropping massive ordnance penetrator (MOP) “bunker buster” bombs on the Fordow site and other weapons against the other facilities. When Lt Gen Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, reported a preliminary intelligence assessment that Iran’s nuclear capability had not been “obliterated”, as Trump had boasted, he was summarily fired.\nTrump has claimed to have brokered a peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia, after the parties came to the White House for a ceremony to sign a peace treaty. Both governments, however, subsequently acknowledged that this was a publicity stunt designed to help Trump with his campaign for the peace prize and that no peace agreement was actually concluded.\nTrump’s claim to have brokered a peace agreement between India and Pakistan was yet another stunt to burnish his credentials for the prize. When he was snubbed by Modi, Trump used it as a pretext for imposing a punitive tariff. His claim to have brokered a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the withdrawal of Rwandan forces from DRC soil was similarly false. Rwanda-controlled M23 rebels remain on DRC soil, committing massacres in 14 villages in July, and the peace agreement is a fiction.\nTrump has also enabled the Netanyahu government’s campaign of famine against the population of Gaza, granting Netanyahu impunity for his starvation project, while ordering the US representative to the United Nations not to sign a statement from all 14 other members of the security council that the famine in Gaza is a “man-made crisis” and in violation of international law.\nA huge famine also rages in Sudan, connected in significant part to the proxy war fought there by a US ally, the United Arab Emirates. Trump’s decision to stop all USAID relief operations as part of his administration’s wholesale demolition of the agency has made the Sudan famine far more acute. As a result, more than 80% of emergency food kitchens have shut down. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) have stated that the funding cuts are directly contributing to deaths from starvation and disease. The NRC warned that inaction has allowed Sudan’s crisis to worsen “beyond measure”.\nBesides creating the conditions for famine, Trump’s decision to terminate USAID could lead to more than 14 million additional preventable deaths globally by 2030, according to an authoritative July 2025 study in the British medical journal the Lancet – “a staggering number of avoidable deaths”.\nAccording to the report, “USAID funding was associated with a 65% reduction in mortality from HIV/Aids (representing 25.5 million deaths), 51% from malaria (8 million deaths), and 50% from neglected tropical diseases (8.9 million deaths)”, among significant decreases in many other diseases. But Trump has wiped out all these programs.\nAt home, Trump has eviscerated the National Institutes for Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and withheld $2.6bn from Harvard University in federal funds including for medical research on cancer and other diseases. After an armed man with a semi-automatic rifle opposed to vaccines fired 150 rounds into the CDC headquarters in Atlanta and murdered a police officer, Trump said absolutely nothing. He has been a stalwart against any restriction on guns, which are almost without exception the weapons used in school massacres, mass shootings and violent crime.\n“I looked,” reads the Book of Revelation, “and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death.”\n-\nSidney Blumenthal, former senior adviser to Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: A Self-Made Man, Wrestling With His Angel and All the Powers of Earth.

    "raw_text": "When it comes to the rise of autocracy in America, Justice Potter Stewart’s famous pronouncement on pornography might be particularly appropriate at the moment: “I know it when I see it.”\nThe cult of personality was apparent as Donald Trump’s cabinet convened on Wednesday in a marathon session that could have embarrassed even a seasoned strongman, providing for three hours and 17 minutes of fawning television coverage.\nThere was Steve Witkoff, the president’s top envoy and negotiator, standing up in the increasingly gilded Cabinet Room, offering praise that could have made even Vladimir Putin blush. “There’s only one thing I wish for – that the Nobel committee finally gets its act together and realizes that you are the single finest candidate since this Nobel award was ever talked about,” he said to applause from secretaries of state, defense and other top cabinet officials.\nOr was it Stephen Miller on Fox News in effect criminalising the opposition to Trump and calling Chicago a “killing field” despite controverting facts. “The Democrat party is not a political party, it is a domestic extremist organisation,” he said in a strident tone, claiming that the party was devoted “exclusively to the defence of hardened criminals, gangbangers and illegal alien killers and terrorists”.\nWas it the president calling, on social media, for the arrest of a wealthy financier and his son for their support for civil society? “George Soros, and his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their support of Violent Protests, and much more, all throughout the United States of America,” he wrote on Truth Social.\nOr perhaps it was the revocation of Secret Service protection for his electoral rival Kamala Harris, or the FBI raid on the home of John Bolton, his former national security adviser, who has become an outspoken critic of the president’s national security agenda. Or was it in the commonplace nature of a raid outside an elementary school in Mt Pleasant in Washington DC, where police staked out a school with a large Spanish-speaking population in what became just another immigration raid in America.\nSome activists and observers have sounded the alarm: authoritarianism of the kind that Americans are used to condemning abroad has become increasingly normal in the United States.\nDon Moynihan, a political scientist and professor at the University of Michigan, wrote this week that “today, America is a competitive authoritarian system, with a rapidly increasing emphasis on the authoritarian part.”\nThe checklist to consolidate power, he wrote, includes efforts to control the government bureaucracy, the military, internal security, the legal system, civil society, higher education, the media and elections. The pursuit of those aims had been “systematic”, he wrote.\nAbdelrahman ElGendy has watched this process with a feeling of grim recognition. ElGendy spent six years in prison in his native Egypt on political charges, but fled to the US in order to work on a memoir he is set to release next year.\nIn April, however, he packed his things and left the US following the detention of the Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil. ElGendy’s lawyers warned him that he could face a similar fate after his personal details were posted on a website used to target opponents of Israel’s war in Gaza.\nSince then, he has watched from abroad as the situation has worsened.\n“I haven’t second-guessed leaving the US. In fact I feel very grateful that I made the choice that I did before things got even worse,” he said. “I left Egypt to escape political persecution … The reason I left the US is because I started to recognize those same patterns forming around me. And since leaving it’s only gone downhill.”\nWhen Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) began carrying out large-scale raids and he was identified online as a potential target, he said he found himself once again waiting to be taken away at any moment.\n“I don’t think political incarceration is the most important characteristic of authoritarianism, it’s more the constant threat of it that matters most,” he said. “What really sustains authoritarianism is that quiet knowledge that the prison door is always within reach … that shadow is what shapes behavior.”\nFrom Russia to Turkey, and Hungary to El Salvador, activists, observers and political scientists have watched the quick consolidation of power by the Trump administration as it has followed a familiar pattern of autocratic rollout.\nWashington has found common cause with some of the world’s harshest authoritarian regimes such Russia and El Salvador. This week, the US deported nearly 50 Russians, according to activists, including some who probably requested political asylum in the United States. Hundreds of migrants and even citizens have been deported to prisons in El Salvador.\n“Sometimes I almost feel it’s like ‘I told you so,’” said Noah Bullock, the chief executive of Cristosal, a leading human rights group in El Salvador which was forced to leave the country last month after 25 years of documenting abuses of power.\n“With the Ice crackdown and the creation of this massive law enforcement agency that only obeys the president – there are no good historical references where that works out well.”\n“One of the things that I see happening that hits me really close is when these security or police forces begin to look at the whole population as enemies,” he added, comparing it to El Salvador where they had been “trained to see the population as a threat”.\nThe winner-take-all dynamics of the Trump administration, which has claimed a historic mandate despite winning among the thinnest majorities in a generation, have made this a particularly fraught moment. Along with the federal takeover of police forces, the other commonly cited danger is the Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas and resulting fightback in California, as well as other efforts to diminish voter turnout ahead of the 2026 midterm and 2028 presidential elections.\nSome activists insist it is not too late to turn back. Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, and Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international affairs at Princeton University, wrote this week that “We Can Stop the Rise of American Autocracy”.\nCiting Hungary and Venezuela as examples, they wrote that “we cannot be lulled into believing that this is like anything we’ve seen before and can therefore be solved by simply waiting for the midterm elections. The antidote to Trump’s American breed of autocracy is understanding the severity of the threat at hand.”\nBut others see the trend toward authoritarianism as merely an acceleration of the direction of US politics even before Trump.\n“That assumes that the United States was a functioning healthy democracy that slipped … and that’s just not the case in my opinion,” said ElGendy.\n“When a democracy is designed with this capacity for authoritarianism you’re never more than one election away from its reappearance. That’s not an accident, that’s a design flaw.”"

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump cold-called Norway’s finance minister last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, Norwegian press reported on Thursday.\nThe Norwegian outlet Dagens Næringsliv, citing unnamed sources, reported: “Out of the blue, while finance minister Jens Stoltenberg was walking down the street in Oslo, Donald Trump called … He wanted the Nobel prize – and to discuss tariffs.”\nThe outlet added that it was not the first time that Trump had raised the question of a Nobel peace prize nomination to Stoltenberg.\nIn a statement to Reuters, Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary-general, said the call focused on tariffs and economic cooperation ahead of Trump’s call with Jonas Støre, the Norwegian prime minister.\n“I will not go into further detail about the content of the conversation,” Stoltenberg said, adding that several White House officials including the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, were on the call.\nEach year, the five-member Norwegian Nobel committee reviews hundreds of candidates before choosing laureates. The committee members are appointed by Norway’s parliament according to the will of Alfred Nobel, a 19-century Swedish industrialist. Laureates are announced in October.\nTrump has previously complained multiple times about not receiving the Nobel peace prize, an award which four of his predecessors, including Barack Obama, have received.\nIn his most recent tirade, Trump took to Truth Social in June, saying: “No, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be, but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!”"

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump would not rule out using military force to gain control of Greenland, the world’s largest island and an autonomous territory within Denmark, a fellow Nato member with the US.\nSince taking office, the US president has repeatedly expressed the idea of US expansion into Greenland, triggering widespread condemnation and unease both on the island itself and in the global diplomatic community. Greenland is seen as strategically important both for defense and as a future source of mineral wealth.\nIn an interview on NBC’s Meet The Press on Sunday, Trump was asked whether he would rule out using force against the territory.\n“I don’t rule it out. I don’t say I’m going to do it, but I don’t rule out anything. No, not there. We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we’ll take care of, and we’ll cherish them, and all of that. But we need that for international security,” Trump said.\nThe exchange came as part of wide-ranging interview following Trump’s first 100-days in office last week and he was also asked about the idea of using military force against Canada – an idea once unthinkable but now a subject of speculation amid Trump’s repeated assertion he would like to make Canada the US’s 51st state.\n“It’s highly unlikely. I don’t see it with Canada. I just don’t see it, I have to be honest with you,” Trump said.\nTrump said he had spoke with Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, and confirmed that the pair had not spoken about making his country part of the US.\nBut he said they could discuss the topic when Carney visits Washington DC “this week or next week”. Carney, along with around 90% of Canadians, oppose the idea of folding Canada into the US. But Trump said he was open to a discussion.\n“I’ll always talk about that. You know why? We subsidize Canada to the tune of $200bn a year,” Trump said. “We don’t need their cars. In fact, we don’t want their cars. We don’t need their energy. We don’t even want their energy. We have more than they do. We don’t want their lumber. We have great lumber. All I have to do is free it up from the environmental lunatics.”\nTrump said that if “Canada was part of the US it wouldn’t cost us. It would be great … it would be a cherished state. And, if you look at our map, if you look at the geography – I’m a real estate guy at heart. When I look down at that without that artificial line that was drawn with a ruler many years ago – was just an artificial line, goes straight across. You don’t even realize.”\n“What a beautiful country it would be,” he added.\nA poll published last month found that 68% of Americans believe Trump is serious about the US trying to take over Greenland, and 53% think Trump is serious when he talks about the US trying to take control of Canada.\nBut the survey, commissioned by ABC News found that respondents didn’t think either annexation would be a good idea. About 86% said they opposed the US trying to take control of Canada, and 76% opposed trying to take control of Greenland."

    "raw_text": "The Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower soars over Panama City bay, a 70-storey skyscraper shaped like a sail. Donald Trump’s first international hotel venture, it opened in 2011, a mix of condominiums, hotel rooms and a casino.\nAs one of the tallest structures in Latin America, it was a bold and lucrative expression of the Trump brand, earning him as much as $13.9m in management fees and royalties in the last three years.\nBy day it glints in the tropical sunshine, an apparently shining testament to the US president’s business savvy.\nBut a curious thing happens at night. Many of the lights stay off. The restaurants are near deserted; the corridors silent. The skyscraper appears to be largely empty – a dark tower.\nMany of those who bought the condos, it turns out, did so not to live there but allegedly to launder illicit money – Russian gangster money, drug cartel money, people-smuggling money.\nA joint Reuters-NBC News investigation published on Friday alongside a report by the non-profit Global Witness said the skyscraper with Trump’s name had ties to international organised crime.\nThe reports detailed how the future president gave the project to his daughter Ivanka as a “baby” effort to gain real estate experience, and said it ended up drawing a cast of characters accused of fraud, corruption and kidnapping.\nTrump may not have intended to facilitate criminal activity but the Panama tower “aligned” his financial interests with crooks, said Global Witness. “Trump seems to have done little to nothing to prevent this. What is clear is that proceeds from Colombian cartels’ narcotics trafficking were laundered through the Trump Ocean Club and that Donald Trump was one of the beneficiaries.”\nThere is no evidence that the Trump Organization or members of the Trump family broke the law or knew of the criminal backgrounds of some of the tower’s brokers, buyers and investors.\nThe White House and Ivanka Trump referred requests for comment to the Trump Organization, which issued a statement distancing itself from the tower.\n“The Trump Organization was not the owner, developer or seller of the Trump Ocean Club Panama project. Because of its limited role, the company was not responsible for the financing of the project and had no involvement in the sale of units or the retention of any real estate brokers.”\nThe story may endure. The president won last year’s election on the promise of draining corruption in Washington and building a wall to keep out drugs and undesirable immigrants. Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating Russian influence in the election, is looking at Trump’s business dealings.\nTrump lent his name but did not exert management control over the tower’s construction and was under no direct legal obligation to conduct due diligence on other people involved.\nBut Arthur Middlemiss, a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan and a former head of JP Morgan’s global anti-corruption program, told Reuters that since Panama was “perceived to be highly corrupt”, anyone engaged in business there should conduct due diligence on business collaborators. If they did not, he said, there was a potential risk in US law of being liable for turning a blind eye to wrongdoing.\nTrump wanted to use the Panama project as a “baby” for Ivanka, Roger Khafif, a Panamian developer who pitched the deal to Trump in 2005, told Reuters.\nShe helped kickstart the project a year later by selecting a Brazilian former car salesman, Alexandre Ventura Nogueira, as a lead broker to sell units. He promised quick sales at high prices. Ventura’s firm, Homes Real Estate Investment & Services, delivered, selling 350 to 400 units, about $100m worth of property, he told Reuters and NBC.\nHe met Ivanka numerous times, met her brothers Eric and Donald Jr, and met the future president once, at a celebratory event in 2008 at Mar-a-Lago, the family’s Florida estate.\nA year later, however, Ventura was arrested in Panama for real estate fraud, unrelated to the Trump project, and fled on bail.\nNow a fugitive, the 43-year-old spoke from an undisclosed European city wearing a disguise.\nVentura said some of his brokers and clients who traded units in the Trump Ocean Club were connected to the Russian mafia and other organised crime groups.\nHe said he sold seven to 10 units to David Murcia Guzmán, a disgraced entrepreneur who is currently in US custody awaiting extradition to Colombia after being convicted by a US federal court of laundering money for drug cartels, including through real estate.\nVentura said he sold about half the units to Russian-speaking brokers, including Arkady Vodovozov, who, according to court files cited by Reuters, was convicted of kidnapping in Israel, and Igor Anapolskiy, who, according to Ukrainian court documents cited by Global Witness, was convicted in 2014 of forging travel documents.\nAnother was Stanislav Kavalenka, who, according to Ontario court documents, was charged in Canada with “compelling” and “procuring” women to engage in prostitution. The case was later withdrawn.\nMany buyers remained unidentified because many units were bought and sold through anonymous shell companies. Ventura said he set up hundreds of such corporations, charging roughly $1,000 each.\n“I had some customers with questionable backgrounds,” he said. “Nobody ever asked me. Banks never asked. Developer didn’t ask and (the) Trump Organization didn’t ask. Nobody ask: ‘Who are the customers, where did the money come from?’ No, nobody ask.”\nMauricio Ceballos, a former financial crimes prosecutor in Panama who investigated Ventura, told NBC the skyscraper was a “vehicle for money laundering”.\nAlan Garten, the Trump Organization’s chief legal officer, played down Ventura’s connections with the Trumps, telling Reuters they did not remember meeting him, and that such contacts would have been “meaningless” and just one of hundreds of public appearances they make each year."

    "raw_text": "I grew up twice. The first time in India, where I was born, and the second time in Ireland. One nation birthed me, the other swaddled my very soul. I was 24 years old when I arrived in Ireland in 1986, one of a handful of “aliens” in Sligo town. The only Irish people I had known until then were nuns, formidable women all, who ran many convent schools in India. I obviously didn’t impress them as I was deemed unmarriageable because of my consistently untidy needlework – at the age of 10. But I held no grudges, leaving India a little over a decade later, fortified by a wonderful education.\nIreland in the 1980s shocked me in more ways than one. Yes, the 40 shades of green, the 21 types of rain, the 32 words for field and the 100,000 welcomes – they were all quite real. But also palpable was a society still stifled by religious commandments. Married people had no right to divorce and there was limited access to contraception if you were unmarried. Abortion wasn’t just illegal, it was banned by the constitution.\nSex, drugs and rock’n’roll was what we were expecting from the west, instead we found Ireland’s young women dancing in circles around their handbags: the local Sligo lads had mostly gone abroad for work. Through the economic recessions of the 1980s, we watched as businesses collapsed, shops were boarded up, families floundered and people, especially young men, fled in droves, emigrating to the far corners of the world in search of jobs and opportunity.\nBut even in those terrible years, racism was the kind of thing that only “eejits” with no “cop-on” indulged in. (To lack cop-on, of course, is a mortal sin in Ireland, which has never suffered fools.) It was not surprising, considering how much prejudice Irish people had faced over centuries as economic migrants themselves.\nOf course, in Ireland – and it happens even now – there was a constant curiosity about us: where we came from and why we spoke English. There was no malice intended and we took no offence, for we had migrated from a country of prying people to a nation of nosy ones and, as a novelist, I make a living out of that very trait.\nIt didn’t take me long to figure out that the social fabric of the two countries was also woven from very similar threads. India has its overt, blatantly cruel caste system, and Ireland its hidden, insidious class divides.\nReligion loomed large in both countries, dishing out succour with one hand and doling out despair with the other. I was already familiar with politically stoked Hindu-Muslim animosities, but Ireland wasn’t slow in schooling me about sectarian divisions. Divide and rule had been perfected in Ireland before being exported across the empire. We shared that too – a colonial backstory and, for a very long while, every possible inferiority complex that came with that trauma.\nSo down the years, not only have I felt at home in Ireland, I am unashamedly evangelical about it. We worked twice as hard to be treated as equals, approaching Ireland with curiosity, enthusiasm, frequent frustration and always humour. And it worked because this is exactly the attitude Irish emigrants adopt when they leave home in search of opportunity.\nI understand the psyche of this wonderful country, and how historical scars have given us a unique perspective. It is not a myth that we hold people who suffer from war, hunger and injustice in other parts of the world in our hearts. And yes, I use the pronouns “we” and “us” with pride, for I’ve been an Irishwoman for over 30 years now.\nBut the past couple of months have been unsettling. People of colour, and particularly those from the Indian community, have been subjected to random, physical assaults.\nOne of the most shocking cases – and among the first to make headlines in India – was an attack on a man who had recently arrived in Dublin to start a tech job. Cruel videos were circulated online of the victim, bleeding, injured, stripped of his clothing, wandering around a Dublin suburb.\nIt is not just in the capital either: in Waterford, a six-year-old girl was reported to have been beaten and told: “Go back to India.” Indian nurses are said to be thinking of leaving. The annual India Day celebration in Dublin last month was cancelled for safety reasons and the Indian embassy advised its citizens in Ireland to “avoid deserted areas”.\nAmong many of us there is disbelief that you could be giving your best to the country only to get kicked in your teeth – literally. Our heightened anxiety is driven by a deep sense of being wronged. I’ve mentally prepared my pat replies if I were to be abused or accused of taking anything I’m not entitled to: my husband saves Irish lives! My daughters too! My son looks after your pets! I’ll make you the most hateful person in my next novel! But in my heart of hearts I know that I would be shocked into silence, for bravado is no match for the utter humiliation of racial abuse.\nSo what has changed? How did this generous, giving country come to be labelled racist? And collectively, as Irish citizens, why are we tolerating such an own goal? Irish people know that our legal immigrants are a lifeline for our struggling health service and provide critical skills to IT, biomedical engineering and pharmaceuticals. Tax-paying, law-abiding, contributing to the GDP – these are people we need. Foreign students are cash cows for the universities. And when they aren’t studying, these same students help prop up a hospitality industry already on its knees.\nHave we simply ignored how much latent bigotry was building because we bought our own narrative – the friendly, compassionate island of saints and scholars – always occupying the moral high ground?\nNow suddenly we find ourselves dazzled by the headlights of harsh new realities: the xenophobes with their absolute mastery of scapegoating. The out-of-state bad actors and bot farms fanning hate on social media. Political parties not willing to man up. Underage perpetrators who cock a snook at justice.\nAt times, I feel I’ve woken in the middle of a fine Irish wake, one that has gone on for two years now, grieving for an Ireland we think we have lost to the far right. Shocked mourners mill around offering sympathies, in agreement that the deceased was sound, one of the good ones. Everyone has brought food for thought, trays of platitude, sandwiches stuffed with good intentions, bottled up anger all served as familiar tunes of regret fill the air. Politicians press hands and leave. Books of condolence are signed and priests call for reflection.\nAnd that’s what I’ve done over recent weeks – reflect. Believe me, it is soul-destroying to be racially abused, so as a first-generation immigrant, an Irish woman of colour, I say stop with the handwringing. Extend those same hands instead in friendship – at a bus stop, on a train, at work. Try small talk with the person in a hospital, at the school gates. A smile in a supermarket queue is more reassuring than any grand political statement. We are good at talking about the weather. Do it, it breaks barriers. Commit to random acts of friendliness. Return to being neighbourly, be nosy even.\nThe Ireland we knew hasn’t gone anywhere. Complacency caught us out, but we can each take our country back by just being what we know we can be: fierce sound people.\n-\nCauvery Madhavan is a novelist and journalist\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "raw_text": "On the morning of 31 January 1984 Ann Lovett put a pair of scissors in her school bag and left her home in Granard, a small town in County Longford, Ireland.\nIt was cold and wet. The 15-year-old was in her uniform but did not go to school. She went to the deserted grotto of St Mary’s church, lay down on gravel, removed her underwear and gave birth in the rain.\nLovett cut the umbilical cord and wrapped the baby boy, who was dead, in her coat. Lovett’s own life slowly bled out of her. By the time she was discovered and taken to hospital it was too late.\nFour decades later, the shocking case continues to haunt Ireland – and colour attitudes to abortion. A new film has put Lovett’s story on cinema screens at the same time as an official report has recommended a loosening of abortion rules.\nThe film Ann, directed by Ciaran Creagh, has revived interest in Lovett’s case and its role in Ireland’s transformation from conservative Catholicism to secular liberalism.\n“It was hugely influential,” said Mary Favier, a GP and co-founder of the advocacy group Global Doctors for Choice. “It was the first time we thought ‘We have to do something differently.’ You couldn’t say it galvanised the movement but it clarified the need for a movement.”\nIndividual stories such as Lovett’s fuelled the campaign to lift a near-total constitutional ban on abortion, said Favier. “There was no way people could not be moved by it – how young she was, how isolated.”\nIreland voted overwhelmingly in a 2018 referendum to lift the ban, paving abortion services in 2019. Last month, a government-commissioned review of the legislation and services, conducted by a barrister, Marie O’Shea, recommended relaxing some rules, including a three-day wait between requesting an abortion and accessing one.\nThe government has not taken a decision, and anti-abortion activists oppose any relaxation, but the fact Ireland is considering further liberalisation is a dramatic contrast to the US, where several states have made abortion prohibited or inaccessible.\nOne reason Lovett’s death had such impact in Ireland was that it came only five months after a referendum had enshrined an abortion ban in the constitution. The tragedy humanised the dilemma faced by girls and women who were pregnant and not married, a social taboo.\nLovett had concealed her pregnancy – relatives, neighbours and teachers all later said they were unaware – and carried the baby to full term.\nAnn, which was released in Ireland on 28 April, is the first screen dramatisation. It cost €200,000 (£177,000) and was backed by the national broadcaster, RTE, and private investors in the US.\nInstead of Granard, where memories remain fraught, the film was shot in Boyle, County Roscommon. The local priest permitted filming on church grounds after being shown the script, said Creagh. “He realised that this wasn’t a film to bash the Catholic church. This was a time when the church, the state, the public, a whole collective, were in the wrong.”\nDespite the harrowing story, audiences have responded positively at screenings and Q&As, said the director. “The response has been amazing. The main thing I’m getting is thanks for shining a light on this.”\nReviewers have lauded the film, especially its lead actor, Zara Devlin, for her portrayal of the schoolgirl. “An honourable tribute to those who failed to escape the clawing theocratic gravity,” said the Irish Times. “Neither Ann’s memory nor her story has left our national psyche,” said the Irish Examiner.\nWhile Ireland considers further liberalisation, human rights organisations have urged the UN to intervene over the curbing of abortion rights in the US. Last month, nearly 200 organisations and experts said the overturning of the federal constitutional right to abortion in 2022 had left 22 million women and girls of reproductive age living in states where abortion was banned or inaccessible.\nFavier said Ireland’s abortion rights movement no longer looked to the US for leadership. Both countries had broadly similar levels of public support for abortion rights but the US religious right had effectively “captured” part of the democratic process, she said. “Our change was grassroots and community-built. It went to citizens and got a vote overwhelmingly in favour. That mandate was so important.”"

Now Donald Trump is turning a failed metaphor into a worse reality.\nOn Tuesday the US president claimed that the military had killed 11 drug traffickers from Venezuela, posting footage of the strike that US officials said took place on a speedboat in international waters in the Caribbean. The administration supplied no evidence for its claim that the boat contained Tren de Aragua members, or drugs, and gave varying accounts of its destination. It also warned that there was more to come, with the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, arguing that intercepting boats had not curbed the drugs problem: “What will stop them is when you blow them up.” Earlier this year, Mr Trump secretly ordered the use of military force against cartels internationally.\nWith US warships patrolling the coast of Venezuela – and F35 fighter jets reportedly dispatched to Puerto Rico – some fear that this could be pretext for a disastrous intervention, as its president, Nicolás Maduro, has suggested. Alternatively, Washington may hope it unnerves other regime members into unseating him, or prompts Mr Maduro himself to flee – two longstanding dreams. The US has already offered a $50m bounty for his arrest. At best, this may be political theatre, with both Mr Maduro and Mr Trump posturing for their bases.\nIf this campaign truly targets the drugs trade, it is dangerous and misguided. Like rebranding the Department of Defense as the “Department of War”, it speaks to Mr Trump’s love of macho spectacle. But it sets a precedent for launching military strikes on whomever the US authorities wish, without congressional approval or a UN mandate, simply by declaring that they are “at war”.\nThe Obama administration stretched the boundaries of executive power, and any plausible definition of self-defence and imminent threat, with its campaign of drone assassinations, including those of American citizens far from battlefields, under the hazy label of the “war on terror”. Despite the high civilian toll and minimal transparency, it met lamentably little political pushback.\nThe Trump administration has gone even further. Cartels are spreading and entrenching themselves in Latin America, devastating communities. But arbitrarily designating them as terrorists is plainly a nonsense. Extrajudicial killings of this kind are always wrong. Offenders who would not face the death penalty if charged are executed without due process. Innocents inevitably fall victim too. Many children were among the thousands killed in Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs” in the Philippines. The former president is now awaiting trial for crimes against humanity at the international criminal court.\nSummary executions are also counterproductive. They make it harder to gather information, and strikes on foreign soil would make governments less likely to cooperate with US efforts, due to the domestic backlash – especially in Mexico. That would not only hamper the fight against drugs, but also Mr Trump’s efforts to curb migration.\nTo tackle its devastating fentanyl epidemic, the US must ultimately tackle demand: an immense task, since it means addressing the conditions that birthed this crisis, as well as entrenched addictions. In the meantime, carefully targeted action and financial disruption would be more effective than killing cartel members. Above all, the administration should stem the flow of US arms, which have supercharged violence in Mexico and elsewhere.\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "raw_text": "The US military has killed 11 drug traffickers from Venezuela during a “a kinetic strike” in the Caribbean Sea, the US president, Donald Trump, has claimed amid growing tensions between Washington and Caracas.\nTrump trailed the announcement during an address at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, telling reporters the US had “just, over the last few minutes, literally shot out … a drug-carrying boat”.\n“And there’s more where that came from. We have a lot of drugs pouring into our country,” the US president added.\nLater, Trump used his social media platform, Truth Social, to offer further details of the operation, which he said had taken place on Tuesday morning.\n“The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in international waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States,” he wrote, alongside footage of the attack.\n“The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike … Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America. BEWARE!”\nThe development will add to fears over a possible military clash between Venezuelan and US troops after the US sent war ships and marines into the Caribbean last month as part of what Trump allies touted as an attempt to force Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, from power.\nOfficially, Trump’s naval buildup is part of US efforts to combat Latin American drug traffickers, including a Venezuelan group called the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns) which Trump officials accuse Maduro of leading.\nIn August the US announced a $50m reward for Maduro’s capture – twice the bounty once offered for Osama bin Laden. In July, Trump signed a secret directive greenlighting military force against Latin American cartels considered terrorist organizations, including the Venezuelan group.\nRepublican party hawks and Trump allies have celebrated those moves as proof the White House is determined to end Maduro’s 12-year rule. “Your days are seriously numbered,” Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, declared recently, encouraging Maduro to flee to Moscow.\nMaduro’s allies have also claimed that a regime-change operation is afoot, with Maduro himself this week warning that White House hardliners were seeking to lead Trump into “a terrible war” that would harm the entire region.\n“Mr President Donald Trump, you need to take care because Marco Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood – with South American, Caribbean blood [and] Venezuelan blood. They want to lead you into a bloodbath … with a massacre against the people of Venezuela,” Maduro said.\nBut many experts are skeptical the US is planning a military intervention. “The idea of there being an invasion, I don’t believe to be true,” James Story, the US’s top diplomat for Venezuela from 2018 to 2023, said last week. He said Trump generally opposed “meddling militarily in the affairs of other countries”.\nGeoff Ramsey, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, agreed: “This is not a deployment focused on regime change. This may be an attempt to signal to disaffected elements of the military in Venezuela that now is the time to rise up against Maduro. But we’ve seen that approach be tried and fail repeatedly over the last 25 years.”\nRamsey said the tough talk belied the fact that Trump had actually relaxed its stance towards Venezuela. Sanctions had been softened in recent weeks. The Trump administration was “actively coordinating with the Maduro regime on deportation flights”, about two of which are landing at Venezuela’s main international airport each week.\nRamsey believed that the military mobilization was partly an attempt “to throw some red meat to a part of Trump’s base that has been dissatisfied with the reality of sanctions relief” and what it perceived as his soft policy towards Maduro.\nRamsey described the region where the vessel was attacked as “a target-rich environment” when it came to drug traffickers. “There are plenty of go-fast boats transporting cocaine through the southern Caribbean, and I think ultimately Washington is more interested in signalling than in actually engaging in any kind of military action inside Venezuela territory.” Trump said those killed in Tuesday’s operation were members of the Tren de Aragua, Venezuela’s most notorious crime group."

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump is sending 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico to bolster US military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean region, it was reported on Friday.\nIf follows a deadly US missile strike on Tuesday on a boat in the Caribbean Sea that the Trump administration insisted was carrying 11 Venezuelan drug traffickers, and comments by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Wednesday that such attacks “will happen again”.\nIn another development on Thursday, the US accused Venezuela of the “highly provocative move” of buzzing one of its warships in international waters.\nThe deployment of strike aircraft to Puerto Rico, first reported by Reuters, citing two sources briefed on the matter, is a sharp escalation of the US president’s crackdown on what he sees as a Venezuelan-led drug-trafficking menace in the region.\nThe planes will arrive in the US territory next week and will be part of a sustained military campaign in the Latin American region that began with Tuesday’s airstrike, the news agency said.\nThe F-35 is a highly advanced stealth fighter and would be very effective in combat against Venezuela’s air force, which includes F-16 aircraft.\nTrump has already sent at least eight warships and other military assets to the area in recent weeks, and Rubio, speaking in Mexico City on Wednesday; he warned of more operations to come.\n“The US has long, for many, many years, established intelligence that allowed us to interdict and stop drug boats. And we did that. And it doesn’t work. Interdiction doesn’t work,” he told a press conference after meeting with Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, to discuss stronger security ties.\n“What will stop them is when you blow them up. Instead of interdicting it, on the president’s orders, we blew it up. And it’ll happen again. Maybe it’s happening right now.”\nMeanwhile, two Venezuelan military planes flew close to a US warship in international waters, the Pentagon said on Thursday in a social media post, an act it called “a highly provocative move … designed to interfere with our counter narco-terror operations”.\nThe statement by the Department of Defense “strongly advised” the Venezuelan regime of embattled president Nicolás Maduro not to “obstruct, deter or interfere” with US operations.\nMaduro has accused the US of “seeking a regime change through military threat” and promised to build up his own armed forces.\nLast month, the state department increased to $50m its reward “for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Maduro”, whom the US said has conspired with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in cocaine production.\nMore than 50 countries, including the US, refuse to recognize Maduro as head of state after accusing him of rigging the Venezuelan presidential election in 2018.\nPete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, defended the US military buildup in the Caribbean in an appearance on Fox News on Wednesday night.\n“We’ve got assets in the air, assets in the water, assets on ships, because this is a deadly serious mission for us, and it won’t stop with just this strike,” he said.\nHegseth was asked by reporters on Thursday what legal justification was used to kill 11 people that the Trump administration had accused, without presenting evidence, of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.\n“We have the absolute authority and complete authority to conduct that,” he said, stating that the group was “assaulting” the US with a flow of illegal drugs.\n“I’d say we smoked a drug boat, and there’s 11 narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean. And when other people try to do that, they’re gonna meet the same fate.”\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, before news of the stealth fighters’ deployment broke, Democratic Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar accused the Trump administration of “lawless and reckless” actions in the Caribbean region.\n“Congress has not declared war on Venezuela, or Tren de Aragua, and the mere designation of a group as a terrorist organization does not give any president carte blanche to ignore Congress’s clear constitutional authority on matters of war and peace,” she said.\n“There is no conceivable legal justification for this use of force. Unless compelling evidence emerges that they were acting in self-defense, that makes the strike a clear violation of international law.”\nTalking to the rightwing channel Newsmax on Wednesday, Rand Paul, the Republican US senator from Kentucky and chair of the Senate homeland security committee, also questioned the legality and morality of the Trump administration’s actions.\n“[I have] no love lost for the people who died that are trying to infiltrate our country with this filth, but at the same time you have to realize it’s not as simple as it may sound, ‘let’s just kill drug dealers’, because sometimes you have to figure out who people are before you kill them,” he said.\n“Even the worst people in our country still get a trial.”\nAnalysts have warned that US aggression in the region will have serious unintended consequences, including the possibility of being drawn into an extended guerrilla war in Venezuela.\n“I increasingly fear that the Trump administration may stumble into an intervention scenario in Venezuela, which would be frankly disastrous,” Juan González, the national security council’s senior director for the western hemisphere during the Biden administration, told the Guardian this week.\n“It’ll become the cause célèbre for every kind of criminal or illegal armed group in the Americas. You’ll end up having people going to Venezuela to fight the Yankees and I think it’ll get messy.”"

    "raw_text": "As US warships carrying cruise missiles and marines powered towards Venezuela’s coastline this week, supporters of the South American country’s president, Nicolás Maduro, warned a dastardly imperialist plot for an Iraq-style invasion was afoot.\n“No one will lay their hands on this land!” Maduro thundered, calling on patriots to help repel the supposed regime change operation by joining his “Bolivarian militia”.\nDonald Trump’s allies posted incendiary social media messages, warning the Venezuelan autocrat the end was nigh. “Your days are seriously numbered,” Trump’s former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, proclaimed, urging Maduro to buy “a one-way ticket to Moscow”.\nAnother Trump supporter, Congressman Carlos Gimenez, celebrated “the largest military presence we have ever had off the coast of Venezuela” and told Maduro to accept “his time is up!”\nThe naval buildup and bellicose rhetoric might suggest Latin America is on the brink of an extraordinary foreign intervention, the likes of which the region hasn’t seen since US troops invaded Panama to overthrow its dictator, Manuel Noriega, in 1989. On Thursday, Cuba’s foreign ministry accused the US of seeking to turn “the waters of the Caribbean Sea into a war zone”.\nBut Venezuela experts and former US diplomats are skeptical Caracas is about to suffer a Baghdad-style “shock and awe” assault.\n“This is all performance on both sides,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.\n“No one in their right mind thinks that with 4,500 people you can invade a country that’s got mountains, jungle and multiple urban centres,” Sabatini added, referring to the number of US military personnel being deployed to the Caribbean Sea as part of an “amphibious ready group” theoretically capable of launching an attack from the sea.\nJames Story, the US’s top diplomat for Venezuela from 2018 to 2023, was similarly doubtful, suspecting the mobilization was “more about a show of force” than a “utilization of force”.\nStory believed many Venezuelans were so furious with Maduro’s destruction of the country’s economy and theft of last year’s presidential election that they wouldn’t necessarily oppose him being deposed by a foreign force. “But the belief that somehow this particular group of ships and the US government portends a military engagement, I don’t believe that to be true,” added Story, who thought insufficient assets were being deployed for a military attack.\n“Would it be capable of firing missiles, for instance, and doing a surgical strike against Fuerte Tiuna [the military base where Maduro is believed to live]? Yes, it could do that. But you could do that without such an ostentatious display of force as well. So the idea of there being an invasion, I don’t believe to be true,” said Story, who also believed Trump was generally against “meddling militarily in the affairs of other countries”.\nEvan Ellis, a Latin America specialist from the US Army War College, told the Financial Times the naval deployment would allow the US to put “a lot of forces on the ground pretty quickly”. Their “logical mission” would be “a snatch-and-grab operation to bring Maduro to justice”. But the academic, who served under secretary of state Mike Pompeo during Trump’s first administration, was not convinced Trump was “committed to pulling the trigger” on such a mission yet.\nOfficially, Trump’s Caribbean deployment is part of US efforts to combat Latin American narco-traffickers, including a Venezuelan group called the Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns). Trump officials have accused Maduro of leading that cartel – charges the Venezuelan rejects – and recently slapped a $50m bounty on his head – twice the value once offered for Osama bin Laden’s capture. In July, Trump signed a secret directive authorizing the use of military force against Latin American cartels considered terrorist organizations, including the Venezuelan group.\nBut Sabatini suspected Trump’s mobilization was largely about rattling the inner circle around Maduro and provoking “a massive defection” that would end his 12-year rule. “It’s amateur psyops,” Sabatini said, predicting such efforts would founder, just as they did in 2019, when Trump backed a botched attempt to topple Maduro by using threats and sanctions to encourage a military uprising that flopped.\nBack then, Trump’s national security advisor, John Bolton, claimed Maduro was “surrounded by scorpions in a bottle” and his downfall was “only a matter of time”.\nSix years on Maduro remains president and seems stronger than ever having claimed a third six-year term after allegedly stealing last July’s election.\nThomas Shannon, a veteran US diplomat who has worked on Venezuela since the 90s, believed Trump was well aware the 2019 “regime-change effort” had failed “miserably”. That explained why the US president had started his second term trying a different approach: engaging with Maduro and sending his special envoy, Richard Grenell, to Caracas to negotiate.\nLicences allowing US energy firms such as Chevron to operate in Venezuela – which boasts the world’s largest known oil reserves – were initially left in place. “He even lets people know that there’s some degree of admiration for Maduro as a strong leader,” Shannon recalled.\nBy May, however, Trump needed the support of Republican hardliners for his “big beautiful bill” for taxation. That required him to toughen his stance on Venezuela – at least superficially: hence the increasingly aggressive rhetoric and, now, the naval deployment.\nAsked on Thursday if Trump was considering strikes on military facilities in Venezuela, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, called Maduro the “fugitive head” of a “narco-terror cartel” and said: “The president is prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible for justice”.\n“I think it’s intimidation,” Shannon said of the naval buildup, although that did not mean it was risk-free. “The danger … is that when you have that kind of military presence, the potential for something going wrong is always significant. And so the question is, what’s next?”\nStory and many Venezuelans suspect the answer is more of the same. “The safe money is that Maduro’s not going anywhere – that’s the easy call,” said the ex-diplomat, who saw no evidence of a serious plan for what might happen if Maduro was overthrown or how to handle the political and social chaos that would ensue. “I don’t think anybody has a good idea of what comes next, which to me implies that no one’s ready to take Maduro out,” Story said.\nOn the calm streets of Caracas there is little sign of imminent conflict or change.\nAs he took a break from playing football near Fuerte Tiuna, a 31-year-old accountant who gave his name as Hidalgo said he doubted the sabre-rattling would come to anything. Hidalgo hoped a democratic solution could be found for Venezuela’s political deadlock and that bloodshed could be avoided.\n“History teaches us that after this kind of conflict, what follows is chaos,” he said. “When there’s this kind of conflict it’s the innocent who always pay the price.”"

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Friday authorizing the US Department of Defense to rebrand itself as the “Department of War”, the White House said, as part of an attempt to formalize the name change without an act of Congress.\nThe order will designate “Department of War” as a “secondary title”, an administration official said, as a way to get around the need for congressional approval to formally rename a federal agency.\nBut the order will instruct the rest of the executive branch to use the “Department of War” name in internal and external communications, and allows the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, and other officials to use “secretary of war” as official titles.\nThe order – seemingly in recognition of the limitation of the executive action alone – also directs Hegseth to recommend potential legislative moves the administration could take to permanently rename the defense department.\nTrump and Hegseth have been publicly pushing for the rebrand for weeks, claiming the change would present the US military as more aggressive to the world by reverting to the name that was used when the US was victorious in the first and second world wars.\n“Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was the Department of War,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office last week. “Then we changed it to Department of Defense.”\nAsked about the need for congressional approval to change the name of a federal agency, Trump suggested the administration saw it as a formality. “We’re just going to do it. I’m sure Congress will go along, if we need that. I don’t think we even need that,” he said.\nWhite House officials privately suggested on Thursday that they were keen to do something symbolic to mark the 200th day of Trump’s second term.\nThe US government had a Department of War until shortly after the second world war. In 1949, Congress amended the National Security Act, which named the new agency the Department of Defense.\nThe rebrand to the Department of War comes as Trump has repeatedly made the case that he should receive the Nobel peace prize for pushing for the end of conflicts in the Middle East and the Ukraine war.\nBut critics have suggested the renaming of effort runs counter to the aims of the prize and his interventions to try to end conflicts have come at a cost, arguing Trump often aligns himself with aggressors.\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Gambino"

    "raw_text": "The US military’s killing of 11 alleged Venezuelan drug traffickers traveling by boat in international waters in the Caribbean is an illegal use of war powers to address what should have been a situation of law enforcement. Unless this dangerous precedent is condemned and curtailed, it will enable US authorities to summarily shoot anyone they choose by simply declaring a “war” against them.\nLast month, it was reported that Donald Trump had signed a secret decree authorizing the Pentagon to use military force against certain designated Latin American drug cartels, claiming that they were “terrorist” organizations. On Tuesday, Trump wrote that on his orders the military had targeted Tren de Aragua “narcoterrorists”, accusing them of “operating under the control of Nicolas Maduro”, the Venezuelan leader, and being “responsible for mass murder, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and acts of violence and terror across the United States and Western Hemisphere”.\nNo reported attempt was made to interdict and detain the boatload of people. The video accompanying Trump’s statement suggests that the boat was simply blown up. When asked why the boat wasn’t stopped and its occupants arrested, Trump ducked the question and suggested that the killings would force traffickers to think twice before trying to move drugs to the United States.\nUnder international standards for law enforcement, lethal force can be used solely as a last resort to meet an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. That rule makes sense because law-enforcement officials should ordinarily seek to arrest and prosecute criminal suspects. That is the best way to ensure they have committed the offense in question. It also respects the fact that for most crimes, the penalty upon conviction is a prison sentence, not the death penalty – let alone summary killing without trial.\nTrump has sought to evade those standards by in effect declaring war against Venezuelan drug cartels. Beginning with Richard Nixon in 1971, US presidents have repeatedly referred to a “war on drugs”, but that was a metaphoric war, a rhetorical claim that the effort was important, not a literal war. The distinction is important, because in genuine armed conflicts, opposing combatants can be summarily shot unless they are surrendering or in custody. There is ordinarily no duty to try to capture or arrest them.\nThere was nothing in the encounter in the Caribbean Sea that is indicative of a war. There has been no suggestion that the alleged drug traffickers were firing at US forces or otherwise engaged in what could fairly be described as combat. The US military simply blew them out the water. It wrongly applied wartime rules in what should have been a law-enforcement situation.\nThat Trump calls drug-trafficking suspects “terrorists” doesn’t change the rules for law enforcement. Terrorists are criminals, not combatants. Absent an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury, they must be arrested, not shot.\nThat illicit drugs such as fentanyl cause enormous harm also does not alter the rules governing law-enforcement operations. Much criminal activity causes serious harm, but unless that harm constitutes an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury and cannot be stopped by other means, law-enforcement standards require arrest and prosecution, not the use of lethal force.\nNor does it matter that the people killed may have been hardened criminals. Even despicable individuals are entitled to arrest and prosecution rather than summary killing.\nIf war rules could be applied to suspected terrorists or drug traffickers by a mere declaration of “war”, the risks would be enormous. Law-enforcement officers could shoot anyone anywhere on the mere assertion, never proved in court, that they were part of the group against which a “war” had been declared. What just happened at sea in the Caribbean could be replicated on the streets of New York, London or Paris.\nUntil now, the most visible example of a leader treating a “war on drugs” as a genuine armed conflict has been the former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte. Under his direction, Filipino security forces summarily killed thousands of poor young men. The international criminal court charged him for these executions, and he is now in custody in The Hague awaiting trial.\nLindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator and a Republican leader on foreign policy, met the killing of the 11 with callous bravado: “I hope America’s adversaries are watching & now understand there’s a new sheriff in town.” But even a new sheriff must abide by policing rules. Trump did not.\nWe have every reason to worry that the Trump administration intends to continue this lawless behavior. Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, warned that such operations “will happen again”.\nTo avoid normalizing such flouting of law-enforcement rules, the Trump administration’s killing of the alleged drug traffickers must be broadly and firmly criticized. If we close our eyes to this instance of misapplied war rules because of dislike for Venezuelan drug cartels or fear of illicit drugs, we risk setting a precedent in which our most basic right to life is suddenly dependent on whether Trump or other leaders decide in effect to declare a war against us.\n-\nKenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs. His book, Righting Wrongs: Three Decades on the Front Lines Battling Abusive Governments, was published by Knopf and Allen Lane in February."

    "raw_text": "The sun had yet to rise when missiles launched by CIA drones struck a clutch of buildings and vehicles in the lower Kurram tribal agency of Pakistan, killing four or five people and injuring another. It was February 22, 2016, and the American drone campaign had entered its second decade. Over the next weeks, officials in Washington and Rome announced that the US military would use the Sigonella air base in Sicily to launch strikes against targets in Libya. American strikes in Yemen killed four people driving on a road in the governorate of Shabwah and eight people in two small villages in the governorate of Abyan. A strike in Syria killed an Indian citizen believed to be a recruiter for the self-styled Islamic State, and another strike killed a suspected Islamic State fighter in northern Iraq. A particularly bloody series of drone strikes and airstrikes in Somalia incinerated some 150 suspected militants at what American officials described as a training camp for terrorists. In south-eastern Afghanistan, a series of drone strikes killed 12 men in a pickup truck, two men who attempted to retrieve the bodies, and another three men who approached the area when they became worried about the others.\nOver just a short period in early 2016, in other words, the United States deployed remotely piloted aircraft to carry out deadly attacks in six countries across central and south Asia, north Africa, and the Middle East, and it announced that it had expanded its capacity to carry out attacks in a seventh. And yet with the possible exception of the strike in Somalia, which garnered news coverage because of the extraordinary death toll, the drone attacks did not seem to spark controversy or reflection. As the 2016 presidential primaries were getting under way, sporadic and sketchy reports of strikes in remote regions of the world provided a kind of background noise – a drone in a different sense of the word – to which Americans had become inured.\nSenior officials in the administration of President Barack Obama variously described drone strikes as “precise,” “closely supervised,” “effective,” “indispensable,” and even the “only game in town” – but what they emphasized most of all is that the drone strikes they authorized were lawful.\nIn this context, though, “lawful” had a specialized meaning. Except at the highest level of abstraction, the law of the drone campaign had not been enacted by Congress or published in the US Code. No federal agency had issued regulations relating to drone strikes, and no federal court had adjudicated their legality. Obama administration officials insisted that drone strikes were lawful, but the “law” they invoked was their own. It was written by executive branch lawyers behind closed doors, withheld from the public and even from Congress, and shielded from judicial review.\nSecret law is unsettling in any context, but it was especially so in this one. For decades the US government had condemned targeted killings, characterizing them as assassinations or extrajudicial executions. On its face, the drone campaign signified a dramatic departure from that position – a departure that demanded explanation, at the very least. It was far from obvious what distinguished American drone strikes from the targeted killings the United States had historically rejected as unlawful. Nor was it clear how these targeted killings could be reconciled with international human rights law, with a decades-old executive order that bans assassinations, with the constitutional guarantee of due process, or, for that matter, with domestic laws that criminalize murder.\nThe scale of the drone campaign, and the human cost of it, made government secrecy even more disquieting. The United States was carrying out lethal strikes not only on actual battlefields, but in places far removed from them as well. The first strike President Obama authorized killed at least nine people in the tribal areas of Pakistan. An early strike in Yemen, albeit one carried out with cruise missiles rather than drones, killed two families, including as many as 21 children – and, according to the New York Times, “left behind a trail of cluster bombs that subsequently killed more innocents.” By the end of President Obama’s first term, American strikes had killed several thousand people in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, including many hundreds of civilian bystanders. The deaths of innocents raised sharp moral questions, and the moral questions gave urgency to the legal ones.\nEarly in 2010, American media organizations began to report that Anwar al-Awlaki, an American, had been added to “kill lists” maintained by the CIA and JSOC – the US military’s Joint Special Operations Command. Awlaki had once been a preacher at a mosque near Falls Church, Virginia. He had condemned the September 11 attacks, encouraged “interfaith dialogue,” and been invited to dine at the Pentagon. In the weeks after the attacks, however, the FBI became suspicious of Awlaki’s earlier contact with several of the hijackers. FBI agents interviewed Awlaki repeatedly and placed him under constant surveillance. In 2002, citing a “climate of fear [and] intimidation,” Awlaki left the United States for the United Kingdom. Two years later he returned to Yemen, where he had spent much of his childhood and where most of his family still lived.\nBut Awlaki’s past followed him to Yemen. Soon after he arrived there, the United States pressured the Yemeni government to detain him. He was imprisoned without trial. By the time he was freed 18 months later – the FBI having been unable to provide the Yemeni government with evidence to justify his continued imprisonment – his views toward the United States had hardened. In online videos, and in an English-language magazine called Inspire, he became an unforgiving critic of US policies and, in some instances, an apologist for attacks against Americans. In 2009, a Nigerian, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, tried to detonate plastic explosives on a Christmas Day flight from Amsterdam to Detroit; American intelligence officials came to suspect that he had been equipped by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, a Yemen-based group, and that he had been instructed by Awlaki. By early 2010, American intelligence officials were describing Awlaki as the “Bin Laden of the internet” and “the most dangerous man in the world” – and they had marked him for death.\nIntelligence officials’ claims about Awlaki were exceptionally grave ones, but the astonishing revelation that the government intended to carry out the deliberate and premeditated targeted killing of one of its own citizens – something the United States had not done since at least the civil war – brought the debate about the government’s drone campaign into American courtrooms. I traveled to Sana’a, Yemen’s capital, in the spring of 2010 with Ben Wizner, one of my colleagues at the American Civil Liberties Union, to meet with Nasser al-Awlaki, Anwar’s father. At the offices of a Yemeni human rights organization, Dr Awlaki, an American-trained economist who had gone on to become a minister in Yemen’s government and then the president of Yemen’s largest university, asked us, disbelievingly, whether the US constitution could possibly permit what the government was proposing to do. When Ben and I returned to New York, we worked with Pardiss Kebriaei and Maria LaHood at the Center for Constitutional Rights to develop a challenge to the lawfulness of the government’s kill lists.\nIt was a bizarre death penalty case in which there was no indictment, the accused was in hiding overseas, and the prosecutors, who had already pronounced the sentence, were apoplectic at the suggestion that there should be anything resembling a trial. In the fall of 2010, John Bates, a federal district court judge, presided over a hearing in which justice department lawyers argued that the constitution permits the government to kill suspected terrorists without judicial process, and we argued in response that if the constitution meant anything at all, it surely meant that the government could not kill its own citizens without ever justifying its actions to a court. In his subsequent ruling, Bates wrote that the case was “unique and extraordinary,” and he conceded that it raised profound questions about “the proper role of the courts in our constitutional structure,” but he nonetheless dismissed the case on procedural and jurisdictional grounds. Nine months later, with the court having declined to intervene, a drone strike in Yemen’s northern al-Jawf governorate killed Awlaki and three others, including Samir Khan, the 25-year-old American who published and edited Inspire.\nLess expected – and more shocking – was the US government’s killing, two weeks later, of Anwar’s American-born son, Abdulrahman. A gangly, bookish 16-year-old, Abdulrahman had set out from his grandparents’ home in Sana’a determined to find his father. Not knowing where to look, he traveled by bus to the southern governorate of Shabwah, where his extended family lived. He learned there of the drone strike that had killed his father hundreds of miles to the north. While President Obama was at Fort Myer in Virginia describing the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki as “a tribute to our intelligence community,” 16-year-old Abdulrahman was in the remote province of Shabwah struggling to come to terms with his father’s death. One evening he and his cousins stopped by the side of the road at the kind of informal, open-air restaurant that is common in Yemen. A group of men already gathered there were roasting lamb over an open fire. Abdulrahman and his companions set out a blanket on the ground. They would probably have heard the buzz of drones overhead; perhaps they would have seen a flash of light. Hours later, when other family members arrived at the site, they found only a crater, scattered body parts, and the remnants of American missiles.\nWe filed another suit, this time on behalf of the estates of Anwar and Abdulrahman al-Awlaki and Samir Khan. Judge Bates had rejected our earlier effort, but we hoped another judge might be more receptive to a case that sought after-the-fact judicial review of the government’s actions – especially because those actions had resulted in the death of a 16-year-old boy. Hina Shamsi, my colleague who argued the case, pressed the court to consider the implications of closing the courthouse door. But this second case was also dismissed, with the government contending again that the lawfulness of drone strikes was for the political branches to decide, and with Judge Rosemary M Collyer ultimately holding that legal remedies that would have been available in other contexts were not available in this one.\nThe litigation relating to the strikes that killed the three Americans in Yemen prompted a degree of public reflection about the drone campaign and forced the government to clarify and defend some of its positions. It also compelled courts to confront (if not answer) important legal questions relating to the government’s policies. But the debate generated by the litigation was a narrow one, focusing mainly on the scope of the US government’s authority to kill its own citizens, and even that debate was distorted by secrecy and selective disclosure. Government officials declared that Anwar al-Awlaki had been an “operational terrorist,” but they declined to disclose the evidence that supported this charge. They withheld memos in which the justice department concluded that the government could kill terrorism suspects without justifying its actions to a court. They intimated that the killing of 16-year-old Abdulrahman had been inadvertent, but they declined to supply an on-the-record account of the strike that resulted in his death, and they withheld the results of their post-strike investigations. They controlled most of the information and disclosed only what they chose to.\nThis book is possible because the secrecy surrounding American drone strikes has begun, at the margins, to erode. The documents collected here shed light on how a president committed to ending the abuses associated with the Bush administration’s “war on terror” came to dramatically expand one of the practices most identified with that war, and they supply a partial view of the legal and policy framework that underlies that practice. But while many of the documents collected here were meant to be defenses of the drone campaign, ultimately they complicate, at the very least, the government’s oft-repeated argument that the campaign is lawful. To be sure, even the existence of these documents is an indication of the extent to which the drone campaign is saturated with the language of law. Perhaps no administration before this one has tried so assiduously to justify its resort to the weapons of war. But the rules that purportedly limit the government’s actions are imprecise and elastic; they are cherry picked from different legal regimes; the government regards some of them to be discretionary rather than binding; and even the rules the government concedes to be binding cannot, in the government’s view, be enforced in any court. If this is law, it is law without limits – law without constraint.\nThere is something ironic, and even sad, in the fact that the expansion and normalization of the drone campaign was overseen by President Obama, a onetime professor of constitutional law who was elected after promising to end the lawless national security policies of the administration that preceded his. Perhaps it is also true, though, that only President Obama could have overseen it. When President George W Bush left office, he was unpopular and distrusted. The evidence he had cited to justify the invasion of Iraq had been exposed as a fiction. His administration’s torture policies were widely viewed as an embarrassment and an outrage. The supreme court had repeatedly rejected his policies relating to military detention and prosecution. It is doubtful that the courts or the public would have allowed him to expand the drone campaign.\nBut many Americans who were appalled when Bush ordered extrajudicial detention were untroubled when Obama ordered extrajudicial killing. If they appreciated the breadth of the power Obama had claimed, they assumed he would use the power wisely. Equally significant, some of the scholars and human rights lawyers who might otherwise have been expected to harshly criticize Obama’s targeted-killing policies were part of Obama’s administration and deeply involved in developing the policies.\nSeveral months before the 2012 presidential election, when it appeared that Americans might not give President Obama a second term, administration officials began to worry privately that the powers they had claimed for themselves might soon be in the hands of another president. They began to consider ways of narrowing the powers they had asserted. By this point, though, the administration had already persuaded a federal judge that the courts had no role to play in determining whether (or when) an American citizen could be targeted by his own government. The administration was already on its way toward persuading another judge that the government should not have to present evidence even after a targeted killing had been carried out. The powers claimed by the Obama administration had become entrenched – so entrenched that they could not readily be surrendered. This was even more true in early 2016, when Obama administration officials turned once again to the question of what legacy they would leave to their successors.\nNow the lethal bureaucracy whose growth Obama personally oversaw will be turned over to a new administration. The powers Obama claimed will be wielded by another president. Perhaps as significant is the jarring fact that the practice of targeted killing – assassination, as it would once have been called, without a second thought – no longer seems remarkable, and the fact that the United States now boasts a legal and bureaucratic infrastructure to sustain this practice. Eight years ago the targeted-killing campaign required a legal and bureaucratic infrastructure, but now that infrastructure will demand a targeted-killing campaign. The question the next president will ask is not whether the powers Obama claimed should be exploited, but where, and against whom.\n- Copyright © 2016 by Jameel Jaffer.

    "raw_text": "The drones came for Ayman Zawahiri on 13 January 2006, hovering over a village in Pakistan called Damadola. Ten months later, they came again for the man who would become al-Qaida’s leader, this time in Bajaur.\nEight years later, Zawahiri is still alive. Seventy-six children and 29 adults, according to reports after the two strikes, are not.\nHowever many Americans know who Zawahiri is, far fewer are familiar with Qari Hussain. Hussain was a deputy commander of the Pakistani Taliban, a militant group aligned with al-Qaida that trained the would-be Times Square bomber, Faisal Shahzad, before his unsuccessful 2010 attack. The drones first came for Hussain years before, on 29 January 2008. Then they came on 23 June 2009, 15 January 2010, 2 October 2010 and 7 October 2010.\nFinally, on 15 October 2010, Hellfire missiles fired from a Predator or Reaper drone killed Hussain, the Pakistani Taliban later confirmed. For the death of a man whom practically no American can name, the US killed 128 people, 13 of them children, none of whom it meant to harm.\nA new analysis of the data available to the public about drone strikes, conducted by the human-rights group Reprieve, indicates that even when operators target specific individuals – the most focused effort of what Barack Obama calls “targeted killing” – they kill vastly more people than their targets, often needing to strike multiple times. Attempts to kill 41 men resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1,147 people, as of 24 November.\nReprieve, sifting through reports compiled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, examined cases in which specific people were targeted by drones multiple times. Their data, shared with the Guardian, raises questions about the accuracy of US intelligence guiding strikes that US officials describe using words like “clinical” and “precise.”\nThe analysis is a partial estimate of the damage wrought by Obama’s favored weapon of war, a tool he and his administration describe as far more precise than more familiar instruments of land or air power.\n“Drone strikes have been sold to the American public on the claim that they’re ‘precise’. But they are only as precise as the intelligence that feeds them. There is nothing precise about intelligence that results in the deaths of 28 unknown people, including women and children, for every ‘bad guy’ the US goes after,” said Reprieve’s Jennifer Gibson, who spearheaded the group’s study.\nSome 24 men specifically targeted in Pakistan resulted in the death of 874 people. All were reported in the press as “killed” on multiple occasions, meaning that numerous strikes were aimed at each of them. The vast majority of those strikes were unsuccessful. An estimated 142 children were killed in the course of pursuing those 24 men, only six of whom died in the course of drone strikes that killed their intended targets.\nIn Yemen, 17 named men were targeted multiple times. Strikes on them killed 273 people, at least seven of them children. At least four of the targets are still alive.\nAvailable data for the 41 men targeted for drone strikes across both countries indicate that each of them was reported killed multiple times. Seven of them are believed to still be alive. The status of another, Haji Omar, is unknown. Abu Ubaidah al-Masri, whom drones targeted three times, later died from natural causes, believed to be hepatitis.\nThe data cohort is only a fraction of those killed by US drones overall. Reprieve did not focus on named targets struck only once. Neither Reprieve nor the Guardian examined the subset of drone strikes that do not target specific people: the so-called “signature strikes” that attack people based on a pattern of behavior considered suspicious, rather than intelligence tying their targets to terrorist activity. An analytically conservative Council on Foreign Relations tally assesses that 500 drone strikes outside of Iraq and Afghanistan have killed 3,674 people.\nAs well, the data is agnostic on the validity of the named targets struck on multiple occasions being marked for death in the first place.\nLike all weapons, drones will inevitably miss their targets given enough chances. But the secrecy surrounding them obscures how often misses occur and the reasons for them. Even for the 33 named targets whom the drones eventually killed – successes, by the logic of the drone strikes – another 947 people died in the process.\nThere are myriad problems with analyzing data from US drone strikes. Those strikes occur under a blanket of official secrecy, which means analysts must rely on local media reporting about their aftermath, with all the attendant problems besetting journalism in dangerous or denied places. Anonymous leaks to media organizations, typically citing an unnamed American, Yemeni or Pakistani official, are the only acknowledgements that the strikes actually occur, or target a particular individual.\nWithout the CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command declassifying more information on the strikes, unofficial and imprecise information is all that is available, complicating efforts to independently verify or refute administration assurances about the impact of the drones.\nWhat little US officials say about the strikes typically boils down to assurances that they apply “targeted, surgical pressure to the groups that threaten us,” as John Brennan, now the CIA director, said in a 2011 speech.\n“The only people that we fire a drone at [sic] are confirmed terrorist targets at the highest level after a great deal of vetting that takes a long period of time. We don’t just fire a drone at somebody and think they’re a terrorist,” the secretary of state, John Kerry, said at a BBC forum in 2013.\nA Reprieve team investigating on the ground in Pakistan turned up what it believes to be a confirmed case of mistaken identity. Someone with the same name as a terror suspect on the Obama administration’s “kill list” was killed on the third attempt by US drones. His brother was captured, interrogated and encouraged to “tell the Americans what they want to hear”: that they had in fact killed the right person. Reprieve has withheld identifying details of the family in question, making the story impossible to independently verify.\n“President Obama needs to be straight with the American people about the human cost of this programme. If even his government doesn’t know who is filling the body bags every time a strike goes wrong, his claims that this is a precise programme look like nonsense, and the risk that it is in fact making us less safe looks all too real,” Gibson said.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Of all the reactions to the deaths of two hostages from a missile fired from a US drone, Congressman Adam Schiff provided the deepest insight into the logic underpinning the endless, secret US campaign of global killing.\n“To demand a higher standard of proof than they had here could be the end of these types of counter-terrorism operations,” said Schiff, a California Democrat and one of the most senior legislators overseeing those operations.\nThe standard of proof in the January strike in tribal Pakistan was outlined by the White House press secretary in the aftermath of Barack Obama’s admission about the deaths. An agency that went formally unnamed – likely the CIA, though the military’s Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) also conducts drone strikes – identified what Josh Earnest called an “al-Qaida compound” and marked the building, rather than particular terrorists, for destruction.\nThanks to Obama’s rare admission on Thursday, the realities of what are commonly known as “signature strikes” are belatedly and partially on display. Signature strikes, a key aspect for years of what the administration likes to call its “targeted killing” program, permit the CIA and JSOC to kill without requiring them to know who they kill.\nThe “signatures” at issue are indicators that intelligence analysts associate with terrorist behavior – in practice, a gathering of men, teenaged to middle-aged, traveling in convoys or carrying weapons. In 2012, an unnamed senior official memorably quipped that the CIA considers “three guys doing jumping jacks” a signature of terrorist training.\nCivilian deaths in signature strikes, accordingly, are not accidental. They are, as Schiff framed it, more like a cost of doing business – only the real cost is shielded from the public.\nAn apparatus of official secrecy, built over decades and zealously enforced by Obama, prevents meaningful open scrutiny of the strikes. No one outside the administration knows how many drone strikes are signature strikes. There is no requirement that the CIA or JSOC account for their strikes, nor to provide an estimate of how many people they kill, nor even how they define legally critical terms like “combatant”, terrorist “affiliate” or “leader”. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is suing an obstinate administration to compel disclosure of some of the most basic information there is about a program that has killed thousands of people.\nThe National Security Agency has a complementary term to describe the effects of its mass surveillance on the world’s emails, texts, phone records, webcams, gaming and all other forms of communication: “incidental collection”. Incidental collection is all of the untold trillions of communications data NSA and its partners hoover up that have nothing to do with terrorism or espionage. That collection may not be, strictly speaking, intentional – those communications are not NSA’s “targets” – but it is neither accidental nor, by the logic of bulk surveillance, avoidable.\nSimilarly, civilian deaths in signature strikes do not operate quite like the “collateral damage” familiar from earlier wars. It is one thing for US bombs and missiles to miss their targets or to hit facilities that, at the time of the strike, no longer have their targets in them. It is another for them to hit targets absent prior confirmation that the target is an enemy as a matter of policy.\n“It is a different kind of use of the drone, and it raises issues that are important,” said Glenn Carle, a former CIA interrogator, who added that he is not categorically opposed to drone strikes.\n“I know how the institution [the CIA] functions. For all the errors I’ve spoken about, people are as responsible and serious as humans can be.”\nYet the secrecy around the strikes permits self-interested officials to misrepresent them.\n“By targeting an individual terrorist or a small number of terrorists with ordnance that can be adapted to avoid harming others in the immediate vicinity, it is hard to imagine a tool that can better minimize the risk to civilians than remotely piloted aircraft,” John Brennan, who is now director of the CIA, said in a landmark 2012 speech.\nBut the disclosure of the hostage deaths in January demonstrates that neither an individual terrorist nor a small number of terrorists are necessarily the target of any given strike. Instead, the target can be a facility, transport or other proxy associated with suspected terrorists. (For that matter, the size of the ordnance is relatively small – Hellfire missiles weigh about 100lb – because Predator and Reaper drones are designed to be disposable airframes that can’t hold large payloads.) “Targeted”, in the drone context, is a term that conceals more than it explains.\nSchiff’s reaction condensed the root argument of the administration’s drone advocates: it’s this or nothing. The Obama administration considers the real alternatives to drone strikes to be the unpalatable options of grueling ground wars or passive acceptance of terrorism. Then it congratulates itself for picking the wise, ethical and responsible choice of killing people without knowing who they are.\nThe proposed intelligence budget of the US for the next year is $53.9bn. The NSA and CIA argue that as much of the world’s communications as possible must be collected and clandestine killing operations must be subsequently conducted, or else Americans will die. But according to one of the lead congressional overseers of the drone strikes, expecting the US not to kill people until it knows that they are in fact US enemies – the expectation every platoon leader and sergeant places on every private and corporal – would represent “the end of these types of counterterrorism operations”.\nSchiff is hardly alone within intelligence oversight circles. The default position of congressional overseers, a small slice of Congress empanelled to see secret evidence, is to defend the people they nominally review, even when faced with examples of official duplicity.\nDuring Brennan’s February 2013 confirmation hearing, the Senate intelligence committee laced into the nominee with complaints of how the CIA he sought to lead was lying and obstructing the panel’s investigation into agency torture. Yet then-chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, added a defense of drone strikes predicated on how the CIA had assured her in private briefings that the strikes were now so precise they only killed “single digits”-worth of civilians annually.\nAfter the hearing, a reporter asked Feinstein why she believed the CIA would lie to her about torture and not about drone strikes.\n“That’s a good question, actually,” she responded, after a pause.\nA solemn White House pledged on Thursday to review its drone strike rules. Yet its record casts doubt on anything changing. Obama declared two years ago that he would launch drone strikes only when he had “near certainty” that the “terrorist target is present” and civilians were not. That did not stop the January signature strike that killed Warren Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto.\nNo Obama official involved in drone strikes has ever been disciplined: not only are Brennan and director of national intelligence James Clapper entrenched in their jobs, David Barron, one of the lawyers who told Obama he could kill a US citizen without trial as a first resort, now has a federal judgeship.\nBeyond the question of when the US ought to launch drone strikes lie deeper geostrategic concerns. Obama’s overwhelming focus on counter-terrorism, inherited and embraced from his predecessor, subordinated all other considerations for the drone battlefield of Yemen, which he described as a model for future efforts.\nThe result is the total collapse of the US Yemeni proxy, a regional war Obama appears powerless to influence, the abandonment of US citizens trapped in Yemen and the likely expansion of al-Qaida’s local affiliate. A generation of Yemeni civilians, meanwhile, is growing up afraid of the machines loitering overhead that might kill them without notice.\n“One can make a very strong argument that the costs outweigh the benefits. But it’s not simple,” said Glenn Carle.\nThe view through the soda-straw camera carried in the drone’s belly obscures much of the real picture.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "When Dr Art Van Zee finally understood the scale of the disaster looming over his corner of rural Virginia, he naively imagined the drug industry would be just as alarmed.\nSo the longest-serving doctor in the struggling former mining town of St Charles set out in the early 2000s to tell pharmaceutical executives, federal regulators, Congress and anyone else who would listen that the arrival of a powerful new opioid painkiller was destroying lives and families, and laying the ground for a much bigger catastrophe.\nTwo decades later, as Van Zee surveys the devastation caused by OxyContin and the epidemic of opioid addiction it unleashed, he is still in disbelief at the callous indifference to suffering as one opportunity after another was missed to stop what has become the worst drug epidemic in US history.\nBut the 76-year-old doctor is also shocked that the crisis has got so much worse than even he imagined as one fresh wave of narcotics after another dragged in new generations and drove the death toll ever higher.\n“This region has been through a lot but the drug problem is the worst thing that’s ever happened in central Appalachia in terms of human cost and devastation to individuals and families. You’ve got all these families that came apart, children living with dysfunctional parents or went into foster care. Children who learned from their parents to take drugs from a young age. The devastation is going to go on for generations,” he said.\n“It didn’t have to happen. There were so many missed opportunities. So many times it could have been stopped. Now, I don’t see how it ends.”\nAs it turned out, the drug industry was alarmed by Van Zee’s warnings, but not in the way he expected. It saw the doctor as a threat to profits and so from the very beginning, big pharma responded by working to discredit Van Zee and others like him who rang the alarm on high-strength opioids creating mass addiction.\nYears later, there had been other opportunities to slow the crisis before it evolved from prescription pills to illicitly produced fentanyl and other drugs that together have claimed 800,000 American lives over the past quarter of a century with predictions of another million deaths by the end of the decade. But federal regulators and prosecutors failed to seize the moment.\nPerhaps most disturbing of all, Van Zee said the US was still failing to learn the lessons of a uniquely American catastrophe to break the influence of corporate money over medicine, drug regulation and political accountability.\n“I trace this back to OxyContin and the opioid problem because it brought this huge number of people in our region into the substance-using world, and for so many years good treatment wasn’t available. But now we’ve got methamphetamine, and fentanyl more recently. It’s much worse than I imagined it would ever be, and the lessons haven’t been learned.”\nVan Zee first went to St Charles in the mid-70s as a young doctor volunteering to help out the struggling town in a sliver of Virginia poking like a finger to the west between Kentucky and Tennessee. He liked the place so much, he returned in 1976 and has stayed ever since working at its community health clinic.\nSt Charles and surrounding Lee county once thrived off the coalmines. Thousands of men worked at the largest of them, the Bonny Blue.\n“Saturday night you couldn’t walk through town. It was shoulder to shoulder. They had hotels, grocery stores. It was full of life,” said Van Zee.\nBut by the time the new doctor arrived in town the mines were in retreat and the area struggled as incomes plummeted. Like other parts of Appalachia, distant coal barons got rich plundering the coal but left little behind to sustain the mining towns when the seams ran dry. Some in the region liken their history to the colonial exploitation of Africa and Asia.\nAfter the mines closed in Lee county, the population in St Charles collapsed to the point where in 2022 the Virginia legislature removed the town’s charter because no one ran for office for two elections.\nMany of those who remained were ripe for the plucking when the drug industry came pushing opioid painkillers in the late 1990s, and one drug in particular. OxyContin was so powerful it wasn’t long before it was known as “heroin in a pill”.\nThe mix of ageing laborers with worn-out bodies seeking pain relief and young people looking for escape turned out to be a rich market for big pharma.\nVan Zee saw the first flickers of the coming epidemic in 1999 when patients began telling him about partners and children suddenly hooked on OxyContin. Soon the drug seemed to be everywhere.\nThe manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, was running one of the biggest marketing campaigns in the drug industry’s history to persuade doctors to prescribe OxyContin on the grounds that it was less addictive and more effective than other opioid painkillers. Neither claim was true. In fact, OxyContin’s high narcotic content made it more dangerous.\nMost American doctors had little training in opioids for pain management so they tended to accept at face value the Purdue sales reps’ claims even though they had no medical training at all.\nBy the time Purdue came knocking on Van Zee’s door, he knew better. Still, he was certain that if the drug maker only knew the situation on the ground it would do the right thing. He wrote to the company and to the Food and Drug Administration which regulated big pharma.\nWhen his letters were ignored, Van Zee turned up at meetings where Purdue was using doctors to promote OxyContin and challenged the speakers. He kept writing to the company comparing the growing catastrophe its drug was causing in parts of Appalachia to the “sentinel areas” of New York and San Francisco at the beginning of the HIV/Aids epidemic.\nBy 2001, the situation was so bad in Lee county that Van Zee organised a town hall meeting in St Charles and began a petition to the FDA to have OxyContin withdrawn from sale.\n“There were 800 people in our little high school auditorium over the OxyContin problem because it was painful, it was acute. There was nobody untouched,” he said.\nFinally, Purdue agreed to a meeting where Van Zee proposed the company send warning letters to doctors across the country alerting them to rising OxyContin addiction and death, and end the marketing of the drug except for those who really needed it, like cancer patients.\nPurdue did none of these things. So Van Zee pressed the FDA to restrict OxyContin to treatment of severe pain. The agency called a hearing.\nBy then, OxyContin was earning Purdue Pharma more than $1.5bn a year and making its owners, the Sackler family, extremely rich. Neither had any intention of letting a small-town doctor and other critics of their drug get in the way of booming profits.\nThe industry lined up heavyweight pain specialists in its pay to defend the mass prescribing of opioids at a rate far beyond any other country. One of the specialists who gave evidence was taking money from 16 pharmaceutical companies including Purdue.\nVan Zee made his case at the FDA meeting when the public was permitted to speak but by the end of the two-day hearing it was clear to him that there was no sense of urgency on the part of the federal agency.\n“If the FDA had got on a bus and come down to central Appalachia or gone up to Maine and spent a couple of days talking to people in communities about what was going on maybe they would have understood more. They just didn’t understand the scope and the tragedy of it,” he said.\nVan Zee concluded the FDA was far too close to the drug industry, with agency officials often moving to jobs at big pharmaceutical companies, to be able to regulate it properly.\nSo Van Zee tried Congress. Committees of both houses held a series of hearings in the 2000s.\n“There has never been anything to compare to the epidemic of drug abuse and addiction that we have seen the last three years with OxyContin,” Van Zee told senators.\nPurdue’s head of research and development, Paul Goldenheim, spoke for the company. Goldenheim’s strategy was to absolve OxyContin by blaming the addicted as morally deficient “drug abusers”.\nSenator Christopher Dodd, an influential Democrat who represented Connecticut, where Purdue was headquartered, accused Van Zee of harbouring an “exaggerated fear” of opioids causing addiction and parroted the company’s line that the problem was people not OxyContin.\nBut Van Zee had a prescient warning for Dodd and the rest of the Senate committee.\n“Over the next decade we will find out that there has been a lot of unfortunate errors made about how much we have done with how little knowledge we have had to do it,” he said.\nDeaths did indeed continue to surge, alongside other human costs.\nVan Zee has a map of those parts of his region where OxyContin was most widely prescribed. He lays over it another map of the highest rates of children taken into care during the same period. They closely match.\nIn the early years of the opioid crisis, the number of children taken into care or fostered quadrupled in Lee county.\n“That’s just a fraction because so many of the children didn’t go into foster care but got taken in by grandparents or cousins. They weren’t registered with official statistics,” he said.\nVan Zee and others campaigning to restrict sales of OxyContin found new hope when the US justice department indicted Purdue Pharma and three of its senior executives in 2007 for deceptively marketing the painkiller as safe than similar drugs.\nWas this the moment when Purdue and other companies, such as Johnson & Johnson which had jumped on to the opioid bandwagon, would finally be forced to stop selling the “heroin in a pill”?\nAgain, big pharma slipped away. Prosecutors negotiated a deal in which Purdue paid a large fine but was allowed to go on selling OxyContin largely unfettered, and a deal was struck for its executives to plead guilty to misdemeanours and avoid prison time.\nThe flow of OxyContin was undisturbed and opioid prescribing continued to escalate.\nVan Zee has little time for Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family’s attempts to downplay their responsibility for the cynical and calamitous push to sell OxyContin to people who didn’t need it. The company that fired up and fuelled the opioid epidemic is now bankrupt. The US supreme court will decide whether a deal that allowed the Sacklers to pay billions in restitution, while still holding on to a good chunk of their ill-gotten gains, is legal.\nBut Van Zee is concerned that a narrative has taken hold of Purdue and the Sacklers as the only bad apples and that has resulted in a failure to learn the real lessons of how the big pharma executives were able to behave like what one West Virginia mayor called “drug dealers in Armani suits”.\n“It’s so easy to demonise Purdue and the Sacklers. I agree that what they did was terrible. I think a number of them should be in jail. But I’ve thought for some time that the issue behind it all is the structure of the system,” he said.\n“They were able to do it within a system that allowed and permitted such heavy pharmaceutical influence on the medical professional, on regulation, on Congress. We’ve got to look beyond the Sacklers to be able to change the system somehow.”\nVan Zee points to the huge amount of money spent on marketing drugs in ways not seen in other countries, including television advertising of prescription medicines that is permitted in only one other country, New Zealand. He also wants to break the link between the medical profession and big pharma’s money.\nVan Zee recalls attending a talk by Russell Portenoy, a doctor who was hugely influential in breaking down caution about the risks of opioid addiction and steering physicians toward mass prescribing of painkillers. He was struck by the amount of funding Portenoy received from a raft of drug companies, including Purdue, for research.\n“He spoke with some pride about pharma paying him. So if you’re a primary care doctor and don’t know much about this area, and you hear an expert in the field with 13 letters after their name, you can’t but help be influenced by the message. But that message was influenced by all those pharmaceutical companies who were paying him,” he said.\nYears later, Portenoy recanted his claims for the safety of opioids, and admitted that research money from big pharma influenced outcomes, but by then the damage was long done.\nIn 2019, separate research by Journal of the American Medical Association and the National Bureau of Economic Research demonstrated the correlation between those parts of the US targeted for drug company sales drives and a rise in opioid deaths.\nIn addition, the industry co-opted federal regulators, a medical establishment too often focused on the interests of doctors over patients, and indifferent and corrupted politicians more willing to listen to the word of lobbyists than physicians.\nHospital corporations and health insurers bought into the push to opioids because it was in their financial interests. Drug distributors, among the largest companies in the US, delivered opioid pills by the millions into the heart of the epidemic without any attempt to fulfil their legal, let alone moral, obligations to monitor and report glaring evidence that rogue pharmacies were feeding and profiting from addiction.\nPresident Donald Trump appointed an opioid commission which spread the blame for what it called the US’s “national nightmare” to include the public institutions supposed to protect Americans. Foremost was the FDA, which opened the door to the wide prescribing of powerful opioids in the first place and then made no real effort to close it again.\nThe FDA, its independence increasingly compromised by its dependence on income from the pharmaceutical industry, consistently subordinated public health to the financial interests of the drug makers by permitting ever more opioids on to the market.\nIn 2019, Dr Raeford Brown, then chair of the FDA’s committee advising the agency on whether to approve new prescription opioids, warned that its failure to apply the lessons of its role in the epidemic would perpetuate the crisis.\n“We’re going to revisit an opioid problem in five years and 10 years and 15 years and 25 years. We can’t just make believe that things are going to go away,” he said.\nVan Zee laments that too many doctors are comfortable with the cosy relationship between the medical profession and big pharma.\n“There’s just this tiny thread in medicine of people saying we have to separate ourselves from the industry. When I went to medical school, the usual thing was for drug companies to give medical students black bags and stethoscopes. There was a small number of us that wouldn’t take that,” he said.\nVan Zee supported the “No Free Lunch” movement which sought to break the link between the drug industry and medical training for doctors. Big pharma has a large say in the writing of training manuals which sometimes had the effect of pushing their drugs over other more effective treatments, one reason Americans consume prescription medication at a much higher rate than other countries.\n“They called attention to the issue but it’s always been a minority voice. By and large the profession is quite willing to take the free lunches,” he said.\nVan Zee is not optimistic that the link between corporate money, regulation and the practice of medicine will be broken any time soon.\n“It’d be a huge missed opportunity if there’s not structural changes made in the system. But it would take an earthquake in the structure of capitalism in the United States to be able to pull that off,” he said.\nThe doctor does find reasons for hope. The availability of buprenorphine and other treatments has helped significant numbers of people to get a grip on their addiction, although it does not work for methamphetamines. The drug industry has paid billions of dollars to settle lawsuits by states, counties and municipalities seeking to recover the costs of dealing with the devastation caused by opioids. That money is helping to provide treatment and harm reduction.\nBut in the end, Van Zee said there was no escaping what the pharmaceutical industry unleashed.\n“It’s gonna be a long time that people will be dealing with this. The human cost and what’s happened in our region is not easily repaired,” he said."

    "raw_text": "The US supreme court said on Friday it will decide whether to block a $10bn lawsuit Mexico filed against US gun manufacturers and distributors that argues that their negligent and illegal commercial practices have unleashed bloodshed in the country.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Boston in August, names Smith & Wesson, Barrett Firearms, Beretta, Colt and Glock, as well as Boston-area wholesaler Interstate Arms.\nThe Mexican government says it wants to “put an end to the massive damage that the Defendants cause by actively facilitating the unlawful trafficking of their guns to drug cartels and other criminals in Mexico”.\nMexico says 70% of the weapons trafficked to Mexico come from the US, according to the foreign affairs ministry. In 2019 alone, at least 17,000 homicides were linked to trafficked weapons, it has said.\nAlejandro Celorio, legal advisor for the Mexican government, has said the damage caused by the trafficked guns would be equal to 1.7% to 2% of Mexico’s GDP.\nBut the firearms industry, through its US lobbying body, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, has said the allegations in the lawsuit are “baseless”.\n“The Mexican government is responsible for the rampant crime and corruption within their own borders,” said Lawrence Keane, the group’s senior vice-president and general counsel, said when the lawsuit was filed in 2021.\nThat case has been through a number of lower court rulings. It was initially tossed out by a district court, then revived by the first US circuit court of appeals. The gunmakers appealed that ruling to the supreme court, arguing they have followed lawful practices and the case has no business in US courts.\nIn August, US district judge Dennis Saylor dismissed the case against six of the eight companies, ruling that Mexico had not provided enough evidence that violence in the country was caused by US gun manufacturers’ negligence.\nNow the supreme court has agreed to hear the gunmakers’ petition. Lawyers for Mexico defended the appeal court ruling’s rationale and argued that it was premature for the supreme court to take up the case.\nMexico claims US gunmakers know that the chain from manufacturer to distributor to dealer ends with sales to “straw buyers” who in turn sell them to the cartels, especially military-style weapons with serial numbers that are easy to erase.\nAttorneys for Smith & Wesson contend Mexico is trying to use the American court system to bankrupt the American firearms industry based on a “novel and far-fetched” legal claim. They argue that they are no more responsible for what dealers do than Budweiser is for a liquor store selling beer to a minor.\nMexico is not the only country to claim that US guns are a de-stabilizing influence. A UN report in January estimated that half a million legal and illegal weapons had flooded into Haiti since 2020.\nThe US state department has indicated it plans a new policing unit in Haiti to address weapons being trafficked into the country, which continues to be destabilized by gang violence."

    "raw_text": "“How do you know how much to pay if you don’t know what it is worth?” So ends Theft: A Love Story by the Australian novelist Peter Carey. This scabrous riff on the slipperiness of cultural value in the international art scene asks: is a copy so good that even experts mistake it for the original painting still a fake?\nQuestions of authenticity and attribution are behind a new display by English Heritage at Kenwood House in London to mark the 350th anniversary of the death of Johannes Vermeer. For the first time in 300 years, two nearly identical paintings of the Guitar Player, one signed by the Dutch master, the other on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and until recently believed to be a 17th- or 18th-century copy, will hang side by side. Experts have puzzled over the relationship between the two paintings for 100 years. Now visitors are being invited take part in a game of spot the difference (there are five, apparently), comparing a recognised masterpiece and its “twin”.\nA 2022 exhibition at Washington DC’s National Gallery of Art similarly set out to examine “what makes a Vermeer a Vermeer”. The long-contested Girl With a Flute was subsequently downgraded to the work of an associate, because “the quality falls short of Vermeer’s standards”.\nEarlier this summer, a rumbling dispute about the authenticity of Rubens’ Samson and Delilah, bought for a record sum by the National Gallery in London in 1980, was reignited, with a petition launched calling for a public debate to resolve the issue. The National has been accused of covering up a duff acquisition by applying a modern blockboard to the painting’s back – claims the gallery has rigorously refuted.\nArt-world controversies are often the stuff of detective fiction. The Kenwood masterpiece has fingerprints on its surface, presumably those of the artist himself; the Philadelphia painting still has the wax seal of a long-ago owner on the back. No wonder such stories appeal to writers.\nAlong with Carey’s Theft, other fictional art capers include Michael Frayn’s 1999 Booker-prize shortlisted Headlong, about an art historian who believes he has uncovered a lost Bruegel; Donna Tartt’s 2013 Pulitzer prize-winning The Goldfinch, which takes its title from a 17th-century painting by the Dutch artist Carel Fabritius; and most recently Nell Stevens’ tale of Victorian love and fakery, The Original. There’s even a Simpsons episode, The War of Art, in which Homer and Marge think they have discovered a valuable Dutch painting in a yard sale. Doh! “You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous,” the forger tells a disappointed Lisa.\nHe has a point. But the provenance of a painting is vital, not just to scholars. In a world of fake news, manipulated images and digital art theft, authenticity matters more than ever. Artists are campaigning to protect their intellectual property from AI crawling because authorship is the hallmark of human creativity.\nEnglish Heritage hopes to have a final verdict on the two paintings at Kenwood House by year’s end. The display encourages visitors to really study them, to become amateur art historians. This is part of a growing trend in museums and galleries, such as the new V&A East Storehouse, to involve the public as co-curators. The real winner of this contest is the viewer, who gets to bask in the quiet luminosity of Vermeer while taking part in an important moment in art history.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Theft: A Love Story\nby Peter Carey\n269pp, Faber, £16.99\n\"If you are MAKING ART,\" says a character in Peter Carey's magnificent new novel, \"the labour never ends, no peace, no Sabbath, just eternal churning and cursing and worrying and fretting.\"\nCarey is an artist who churns and curses and worries and frets. His novels roil, threatening at any moment to erupt impolitely all over the carpet. He is formally ostentatious, often inventing fabulist characters with equally fabulist voices and generally remaining allergic to adjective-free naturalism. Perhaps this is why, despite being one of the world's leading novelists, he is more respected than loved. Too emotionally dangerous to be fully embraced by doe-eyed lovers of The Time Traveler's Wife, too much fun to be taken entirely seriously by the dour acolytes of JM Coetzee (the contemporary whose career his most resembles), Carey ploughs his own dogged, compelling, fantastical furrow. For these reasons alone - that he frightens those who want their fiction easy and annoys those who want theirs portentous - a new Peter Carey novel is cause for joy.\nTheft is the story of Michael \"Butcher\" Boone, an Australian artist whose career is having an early and comprehensive twilight. He is guardian, babysitter and caretaker for his \"damaged two hundred and twenty pound brother\", Hugh. \"There is always Hugh,\" Butcher says, \"and you cannot take a slash or park the truck without considering him.\" As the novel opens, Butcher is fresh out of jail for robbing his ex-wife of his own paintings, paintings that became hers when the marriage ended. Exiled to a remote house owned by a fussy former patron, Butcher is trying to get his career back on track, avoid his creditors and manage Hugh, when - on a stormy, flooding evening - he receives a visit from the mysterious Marlene, described by Hugh as \"a GAMINE with tiny boobies and a silk dress you could have fitted in your pocket with your hanky\".\nThrough marriage to Olivier Liebovitz, Marlene is the holder of the droit moral, the hereditary right to authenticate paintings, in this case those of Olivier's dead father, Jacques Liebovitz. Somehow, Butcher and Hugh's farmer neighbour has recently acquired a Liebovitz of mysterious provenance, and Marlene arrives, a vision in Manolo Blahniks tramping through knee-deep mud, to put a validating stamp on it, immediately sending its worth into the stratosphere.\nOr does she? The painting is soon stolen, for which Butcher receives the automatic attentions of Jouvert-like Inspector Amberstreet, causing Butcher to flee to Sydney, where he and Hugh again encounter Marlene. She recognises the marketability in Butcher's recent work and approaches him with an interesting and increasingly dubious proposition, one that moves them on to Tokyo and then New York, where we slowly come to understand that a scam is being perpetrated. But by whom? And on whom? And will it even matter when Butcher finds himself falling in love with Marlene?\nCarey lets both Butcher and Hugh tell the story in alternating chapters, and there is no better writer of voice working today. Butcher's is an Australian wonder: profane, quarrelsome, self-aggrandising, yet capable of some of the most passionate and electrified prose Carey has ever committed to paper: \"How can you know how much to pay [for art] if you have no bloody idea of what it's worth? If you pay 5 million dollars for a Jeff Koons what do you say when you get it home? What do you think?\" As in his last novel, My Life As a Fake, Carey questions the very nature of art, here suggesting how not only art can be faked, but the very process of validating art, too. What value then can \"value\" possibly have?\nHugh, meanwhile, is a world unto himself. With liberal use of capitalisation, his voice manages to be both uncontrollably fluent and believably mentally damaged. Similar to the extraordinary book-long ventriloquism of True History of the Kelly Gang, Hugh's voice rocks and reels to its own rhythms, ticks and vocabulary. He is also what makes this Carey's funniest novel by far: Hugh says of Olivier that \"the skin of his eyelids was soft as a penis freshly bathed\". He visits a park filled with \"TREES FROM THE COUNTRIES OF OUR FORMER ENEMIES\". He talks to Butcher about Marlene, but \"when I asked him whether she permitted him to put it up her bottom he smacked me across the lughole. I WAS ONLY ASKING.\"\nThis is also probably the grumpiest, rudest and stinkiest novel Carey has ever written. A page rarely goes by without someone cussing or farting or smelling very bad. In this and in its subject matter, Theft most resembles Illywhacker, Carey's early epic about an Australian liar. Yet it also comes at the end of a chain of novels in which Carey has taken other literary and cultural touchstones as his starting points. The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith and Jack Maggs were Australian retellings of Tristram Shandy and Great Expectations; Kelly Gang reclaimed the Ned Kelly myth; My Life as a Fake took on the story of the Ern Malley artistic hoax in 60s Australia. And now we have Theft, which bears a key resemblance to a novel by the late, great Australian misanthrope Patrick White.\nWhite is the only Australian so far to win the literature Nobel. His novels are psychologically brutal dissections of human relationships. At their best (Voss or The Tree of Man) they reach a transcendence on what it means to be human, what it means, most of all, to suffer the blessing and curse of living alone in a godless universe. White wrote a novel about a painter, too, The Vivisector, whose paintings exposed every excruciating weakness of his subjects, but it is an earlier White novel to which Theft seems, in part, a response. The Solid Mandala is the story of Arthur and Waldo, twin brothers, one of whom is a would-be artist (in this case a writer) and the other mentally damaged. They live out their lives bound together by Arthur's social retardation in what White calls \"more of a harness than a relationship\". Like Hugh in Theft, however, Arthur sees much more than Waldo ever expects and regards himself as the protector of his \"smarter\" brother.\nIt seems inconceivable that Australia's premier living novelist would echo Australia's only literature Nobel laureate accidentally, and the comparison is useful for the light it sheds not only on the differences between the two artists, but also on how Australia itself has changed. The overwhelming feeling of the first half of The Solid Mandala is hate. Told through the allegedly more normal brother's point of view, this is White at his most vengeful, furious both at his countrymen's obsequiousness to colonialism and at the snobbery of pre- and post-war Australians towards anything that White regards as truly Australian: the working of the land, the endlessness of the sky.\nCarey feels some of that same anger, but his sympathies are entirely with his compatriots. Where White never hesitates to destroy his characters, Carey uses his to rebut the world that dismisses them. Australia no longer kneels at the foot of the empire, but neither is it allowed proper standing as a source of world culture. White blames Australians, fumes at them, punishes them. In Theft, Carey - using every blagging trick his country is famous for - instead produces a particularly Australian form of high culture, taking an ostensibly crude, piss-taking and jocular exterior and backing it up with piercing intelligence and uncomfortable questions about who decides what is art and the often stupid and senseless consequences of those decisions. At the end of White's novel, one brother kills the other, leaving a corpse whose genitals are eaten by dogs. Carey's novel ends with the brothers still side by side, still grouchily optimistic, still laughing at how easily the rest of the world is duped.\nCarey would certainly be Australia's second literature Nobel laureate if the prize didn't seem to reward obscure ponderousness at least as often as true excellence. Carey is probably too vital, too churning a writer to win with the present prize committee. He refuses to avoid good jokes, and cannot resist taking the piss out of his readers and himself. For let me be entirely clear about this: Theft: A Love Story is a novel that will get right up your nose. Carey has produced a humane, gloriously Australian book of grand passion, bad breath and high mischief. It is a rudely brilliant, infuriatingly beautiful, belligerently profane work of art.\n· Patrick Ness's latest book is Topics About Which I Know Nothing. Peter Carey appears at the Guardian Hay festival at 7pm on June 3 (www.hayfestival.com)"

    "raw_text": "Two almost identical paintings have been at one time attributed to the great Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer – but what is the relationship between them?\nVisitors to a new display at Kenwood in London will be invited to draw their own conclusions on this intriguing question when two versions of a 17th-century painting, titled the Guitar Player, hang alongside each other for the first time in 300 years.\nFor many years, the paintings – one of which is in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, while the other hangs at Kenwood – were believed to have been painted by the Dutch master. But in the 1920s, the consensus shifted.\nThe Kenwood painting, which is in much better condition and – crucially – is signed by the artist, was the original Vermeer, experts agreed. The Philadelphia version, in which the young woman wears her hair not in ringlets but tight braids, was widely accepted to be an 17th- or 18th-century copy.\nBut is that the whole story? In 2023, a Dutch art researcher suggested that the Philadelphia painting might be the painter’s own copy of the image – potentially a sensational development for an artist with only 37 acknowledged surviving paintings.\nAs a result, the Philadelphia Museum of Art has been conducting further tests on their painting, while English Heritage, which manages Kenwood and its collection for the nation, has also tested its own Vermeer. While curators anxiously await those results, the two paintings will hang side by side in London for four months, allowing visitors to make up their own minds.\nWhile the original impetus for the dual display was the painter’s 350th anniversary in December, says Wendy Monkhouse, English Heritage’s senior curator at Kenwood, “the emergence of the discussion [over the Philadelphia painting] raised the opportunity to be able to say: ‘OK, let’s really discuss this.’ Both on an expert level, and offering the public an opportunity to become detectives and to weigh the evidence.”\nComparing the works side by side offers the viewer “a rather beautiful confusion”, she says. “You can’t believe your eyes.”\nThe results of the analysis, expected within months, will be illuminating, whether or not they suggest Vermeer painted both works, Monkhouse says. “To have a copy of the Guitar Player by him would be extraordinary, because it would be unique. There is no other copy that he made. [But] if somebody else copied this painting, then what else did they paint in life? Because they’re too good to have just done the one painting.”\n-\nDouble Vision: Vermeer at Kenwood runs from 1 September 2025-11 January 2026 at Kenwood in London."

    "raw_text": "It is an unwelcome question, but an important one: did the National Gallery buy a £2.5m dud?\nThis has remained the suspicion of many experts since one of Britain’s premier cultural institutions acquired Samson and Delilah, a long-lost masterpiece by the Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, in 1980.\nForty-five years on, the debate has been stirred once again, with a petition launched calling for the National Gallery to honour its 1997 promise to stage a public debate on its authenticity.\nThis time, it’s not the front of the painting that’s under scrutiny – it’s the back of it.\nThe debate began soon after the National Gallery bought the biblical depiction, known to have been painted by the master around 1609 before being lost for centuries. For the gallery, it was a 17th-century jewel in its collection, the sort of work to which tourists would flock.\nBut some immediately began to question the brushwork (too clumsy), describing it as a brash 20th-century copy of the original – and these doubts have only intensified. Katarzyna Krzyżagórska-Pisarek, a Rubens scholar, described the Samson and Delilah as “highly problematic” and “oddly modern”.\nAnd Christopher Wright, a leading specialist in 17th-century paintings, said the picture itself was simply “wrong”. He added: “It lacks Rubens’s subtlety. It has a beguiling, slush-and-splosh grandeur … All my instincts of knowing about old masters bring me to that observation. It’s not a 17th-century picture.”\nFeelings run deep in the art world over the question of the painting’s origins. Michael Daley, the director of ArtWatch UK, has researched the painting extensively and claims to have uncovered a mountain of evidence against the Rubens attribution. He calls it “the biggest of all museum scandals” and “a top-down conspiracy to conceal a massive purchasing blunder that debases Rubens’s oeuvre”.\nThe latest twist in this enduring saga comes courtesy of remarks made – and then withdrawn – by Christopher Brown, a former curator of the National Gallery, who headed the Dutch and Flemish collections.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Brown insisted the painting was authentic, but intriguingly, he also said it was the National Gallery that had attached a modern blockboard to the painting’s back.\nThis apparent admission has electrified the Rubens doubters once more.\nThe backs of pictures often carry as much history as the front. With Samson, the panel on which the painting was originally painted has been planed down and attached to a modern blockboard, covering up whatever was underneath.\nCritics suspect that the original panel may have held crucial evidence relating to the date of the painting.\nThe doubters also think the picture’s traditional cradled support was removed at the time.\nThis would mean any clues to the Samson and Delilah’s origins and age – and therefore its authenticity – have disappeared. One piece of evidence on the panel might have been the makers’ monogram, the application of which was the done thing in 17th-century Antwerp. If a panel-maker’s mark had showed the panel to have been made later than around 1609, that would have shown that the painting was almost certainly a copy.\nWhen the gallery acquired the painting in 1980, there was no talk of a blockboard – it was bought as a panel.\nThe gallery’s first public mention of the blockboard was in its 1983 technical bulletin report, with an earlier reference in its 1982 board minutes, when Brown was seeking permission to clean the painting.\nThat was after the gallery had owned it for two years and its timber expert, Anthony Reeve, had described it as one of three unproblematic panels.\nThe National Gallery said the painting’s back had been glued to a blockboard sheet “probably during the [20th] century”, adding in a 1990s exhibition catalogue: “The Samson and Delilah was planed down to a thickness of about 3mm and set into a new blockboard panel before it was acquired by the National Gallery in 1980 and so no trace of a panel maker’s mark can be found.”\nHowever, an eminent art historian’s condition report before the 1980 auction stated that the panel was “excellently preserved” and measured between 25mm and 40mm in thickness.\nAnd herein lies the mystery: who planed down the panel and glued it to modern blockboard, when did they do it and why? Several renowned experts have questioned the logic behind the decision, considering it had been described as being in good shape.\nWright said: “The matter is of very great importance because the blockboard conceals the possible original evidence on the panel. When the picture appeared at Christie’s, it looked immaculate. If the panel had been insecure, it would have been obvious.”\nWhen approached by the Guardian, Brown said it was the gallery that put on the blockboard – a brand-new admission from a former curator held in the utmost regard.\nBrown said: “The present backing was put on by the National Gallery … It’s rather a thin panel. It’s undoubtedly been thinned down at a certain stage and it was really to strengthen the panel.”\nHowever, after the Guardian approached the gallery for comment, Brown later changed his tune. He said: “The National Gallery says that the backboard was applied before its acquisition. I have no reason to disbelieve them, and am certainly not in a position to contradict them.”\nIn his original interview, he had argued that “the idea that the National Gallery is in some way concealing something is nonsense” and that “the great scholars of Rubens have, since 1980, congratulated me”.\nDaley described Brown’s initial comments as “startling”, adding that he himself has “a 2002 correspondence with the gallery denying that this had been done by their restorers”.\nThe painting had been previously attributed to lesser hands, and has no history as a Rubens before 1929, when it was found by Ludwig Burchard, a German historian who, after his death in 1960, was found to have misattributed paintings for commercial gain.\nKrzyżagórska-Pisarek has subsequently discovered that at least 75 works that Burchard attributed to Rubens have been officially demoted.\nShe described the Samson and Delilah as “just the tip of the iceberg”, noting “the harsh, uniform red of Delilah’s dress” and Samson’s muscled back, which she said was “anatomically incorrect”, as well as a “curious lack of craquelure” – fine cracks that would be expected on a 400-year-old painting.\nShe expressed frustration over the lack of debate, adding: “They don’t want a discussion because we’ve got arguments that are really impossible to answer. This cannot be the original Rubens.”\nAmid all the uncertainty, two things are for sure: the provenance of the painting will continue to send the art world into a spin, with scholars and aesthetes across the world continuing to call for that public debate.\nThe National Gallery said: “Samson and Delilah has long been accepted as a masterpiece by Peter Paul Rubens. Not one single Rubens specialist has doubted that the picture is by Rubens. Painted on wood panel in oil shortly after his return to Antwerp in 1608 and demonstrating all that the artist had learned in Italy, it is a work of the highest aesthetic quality.\n“A full discussion of the panel was published by Joyce Plesters and David Bomford in the Gallery’s Technical Bulletin in 1983, when Christopher Brown was the Gallery’s curator responsible for the picture. Their findings remain valid, including their unequivocal statement that the panel was attached to a support before the picture was acquired by the National Gallery.”"

    "raw_text": "Headlong\nMichael Frayn\n(Faber, £6.99)\nBuy it at BOL\nThe mise-en-scène: Martin Clay is in the country with his wife and infant daughter to finish a book. The indomitably philistine Tony Churt, a local landowner, gentry but financially rocky, asks Mr and Mrs Clay to dinner to evaluate a painting in the breakfast room of their decrepit pile.\nAlthough Clay is not the art historian - Mrs Clay is - he does all the talking and then notices what he becomes increasingly convinced is a Breughel; and not just any old Breughel, but a work which would count as the most significant artistic discovery of the century. So how does Clay manage to get the painting out of Churt's hands without arousing his suspicions?\nAs you can see, it's a caper novel - the thinking reader's A White Merc With Fins. Because it is a thinking person's book, it is more melancholy, funny and alert than Merc, but it operates in a similar arena of self-enactment. That is, Martin Clay's excitement at having discovered the most important Breughel ever is mirrored by Frayn's discovery of this as a plot. Or not so much mirrored as enacted. (It's not an entirely original plot, but that doesn't matter.)\nClay's hilarious yet painful and indeed highly believable speculations as to the political, intellectual and symbolic history behind the barely-glimpsed painting are not only the substance of the book, they are analogous to the research Frayn undertook. One feels, at times, that he has simply up-ended his notebook into his word-processor. And, having found a formula which allows him to do precisely that, why shouldn't he?\nWhat keeps the novel spinning so enjoyably are its tensions - between what we are prejudiced to think of as city culture and rustic ignorance, between what is imagined and what is real; between husband and wife; between the ideas of plausibility and fictionality. It is a comedy of misattribution - getting people's motives wrong, picking up the wrong signals.\nThis is high farce; things get so tense that at one point I found myself unable to pick it up for a while - Clay's predicament was simply too distressing, and I wanted to get some sleep that night. (There is low farce, too, or low-ish; a scene of unintended seduction that Frayn places, casually but deliberately, in a bedroom.)\nA couple of reviewers, who are no slouches, have complained of the occasionally sketchy characterisation. True enough, but this is actually a covert declaration of love; it means simply that they want more of Frayn's deft attention to the comedies of embarrassment and greed. I like the way he reveals Clay's place in the rural scheme of things by the sly insertion of the adjective in the otherwise flatly descriptive phrase \"herd of live cows\". (Later on, and without any other comment, he mentions some woods where they found a dead tramp.)\nThere is, of course, a deeper purpose to the book (there is bound to be - Frayn is a philosopher, too), and that is about the importance of art relative to the human scheme of things. Breughel paints his serene pictures at a time of atrocity and oppression; Clay seems to be about to tear his family apart over his extra-curricular obsession.\nSuch erudition (audience-flattery; never hurts at this end), neatness and driving prose made it the favourite for last year's Booker; but there is something too pat, too flattering and professional about it in the end. It shouldn't stop you, though, from wanting to read it."

    "raw_text": "Like almost everyone else, I consumed Donna Tartt's electric first novel The Secret History in a couple of fevered sittings. Here was a psychological page-turner concocted with such genuine emotional sophistication that you felt you'd stumbled on a whole new way of writing. Tartt conveyed the sly evil of amorality with a subtlety that chilled, and in doing so created that relatively rare thing: an immensely readable, yet properly grown-up, debut novel.\nBut that was 20 years ago. And, with only one novel since, our appetite for a new Tartt remains lusty. I don't know what I was expecting when, with some excitement, I picked up The Goldfinch, but a Harry Potter tribute novel was definitely not it.\nTheo is 13 when he survives a bomb attack that kills his mother. Caught in a rainstorm, ducking into a museum to take in an exhibition of old Dutch masters, she has just shown him her favourite, Fabritius's The Goldfinch – \"the smallest in the exhibition and the simplest\" – when the explosion hits.\nThough Theo was stirred by the painting, he was even more stirred by a feisty red-haired girl whom he'd seen accompanying an elderly man around the exhibition. Now, bloodied and dying, this same man presses an antique ring on Theo, which he tells him to take to a place called Hobart and Blackwell – \"Ring the green bell!\" He also urges him to grab Fabritius's painting, lying there frameless and unguarded, and take it home. In a post-traumatic daze, Theo obeys.\nSince Theo's reprobate father ran off some months ago, he is effectively an orphan. Taken in by a school friend's wealthy yet emotionally chilly family on Park Avenue, and still grieving for his mother, he finally remembers to track down Hobart and Blackwell and ring the green bell. There he finds himself welcomed by Hobie, an eccentric but kindly antiques dealer who wears a \"rich paisley robe with satin lapels\" that 'fell almost to his ankles and flowed massively around him'.\nSo far, so JK Rowling. The sensation only deepens when, a few pages later, Theo gets new glasses that are, yes, \"round, tortoiseshell\". And when, 100-odd pages after that, his new best friend actually tells him he looks like the boy wizard – ''Where's your broomstick?\" \"'Left it at Hogwarts,' I said\" – you do start wondering what on earth Tartt is up to here.\nHobie is the business partner of the dead man who, it turns out, was the uncle of the red-haired girl who, like Theo, has survived the attack. Finding sanctuary in his increasingly regular visits to the kindly wizard – sorry, antiques dealer – Theo befriends her. He is therefore aghast when his alcoholic, drug-and-gambling-addict father turns up with a Juicy Couture-wearing, cocaine-snorting girlfriend and whisks him off to live with them in Vegas.\nHere, Theo meets rascally Russian boy Boris (who nicknames him Potter) and these two latchkey children embark on a friendship which, though it includes lengthily described drink and drugs binges and even the odd youthful dabble in homosexuality, nevertheless retains such a bizarrely gung-ho flavour that it might all just as well be straight out of Hogwarts. And all this time, Theo still has the painting, which, though hidden away, he likes to know is there \"for the depth and solidity it gave things\".\nFast-forward eight years and it is not spoiling anything to reveal that, with \"Potter\" now in his 20s, the high jinks continue with ever more drug-addled capers, some of them (inevitably) bloody. For we are now in the world of art crime and, though there is a (mildly guessable) twist involving the painting, and a certain amount of heist movie-style plotting, for all the lack of any real adult darkness or complexity or consequence, we honestly might just as well still be on platform 9¾.\nAnd I admit that by this point, close to the end of a monotonous 800-page novel, I was truly perplexed. Nothing wrong, I suppose, with a Harry Potter homage, but it's hard for an adult reader to be gripped by a tale with no real subtext and peopled entirely by Goodies and Baddies. And, though our narrator comes over as (just about) plausibly male and hetero, his unrequited love for the redhead only exists because Tartt tells us it does. If what we have here is an unreliable narrator who desperately needs to burst out of the closet, then I stand corrected, but nothing in the prose evidences that. Instead it feels as if Tartt simply forgets from time to time what's driving her juggernaut forwards. Hence both redhead and painting – the two supposed passions of our protagonist's life – are dropped for hundreds of pages at a time, and I'm afraid we don't miss them.\nBut maybe none of this would matter much if the writing itself were sharp and pacy, light on its feet. Unfortunately it's leaden, bereft of any attitude or attack, vision or edge. How on earth could a novelist who once treated us to such a tautly sustained suspense-fest have forgotten that one of fiction's most vital tools is the edit, the cut, the authorial nerve to be in charge and not have to tell the reader absolutely bloody everything?\nConversations, monologues – many of them in Boris's broken and extremely tedious-to-read Russian accent – are drawn out over pages. They take the plot nowhere and all too frequently only reiterate things we already know. Not only that, but every scene, every character's face and clothes, every new place or aeroplane or bus or room, whether ultimately relevant or not, is described at such voluminous length that you honestly begin to wonder who the writer is trying to convince – you, or herself?\nThere are some highs. Narcotics and antiques: these, you feel, are where Tartt's heart lies. Her description of the terrible white-knuckle ride that is addiction, while not perhaps deserving of so many pages, has the heartsink ring of authenticity. And when she describes the eerie life of inanimate objects, the way that antique furniture, nurtured and respected down the centuries, can acquire an almost talismanic power, then I believe her absolutely. Here at last her prose comes alive.\nSadly it's not enough to save this great, mystifying mess of a novel. I was intrigued to discover that Fabritius's painting really does exist – not, to be fair, that this matters a jot to the novel. But if even I, no art historian, vaguely remember that goldfinches were often icons of the messiah, then how can Tartt have Theo wonder (again and again) what the artist meant when he painted it: \"Why this subject? A lonely pet bird? Which was in no way characteristic of his age or time…\" ?\nMaybe it's a sad symptom of how little confidence I had by now in either novel or author that, instead of trusting that Tartt must have her reasons for leaving it out, I simply suspected she'd forgotten to put it in. Remember the suicidally long, dope-fuelled follow-up novel that Grady Tripp is writing in Chabon's Wonder Boys? Well, guys, here it is.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "It’s just a painting of a chained bird on its perch, but The Goldfinch by Carel Fabritius has become a pop icon. When I last saw it at the Mauritshuis in The Hague it was singled out from other paintings, roped off, almost like the Mona Lisa. Now it is to be exhibited at the Scottish National Gallery. Will the crowds there from 4 November match the 200,000 people who queued to see it at the Frick Collection in New York in 2014?\nThe popularity of this 17th-century Dutch painting has been hugely enhanced by Donna Tartt’s novel The Goldfinch, whose narrator steals it when he is 13 years old. Yet the true story of The Goldfinch and the man who painted it is stranger than fiction.\nThe novel and the real life of Fabritius have one thing in common: an explosion. Tartt’s character walks off with The Goldfinch (it’s a small painting) after a bomb goes off at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. The key to the true, tragic story behind the painting is, as it happens, a picture of an explosion’s aftermath that hangs in the National Gallery in London.\nEgbert van der Poel’s painting A View of Delft After the Explosion of 1654 depicts a city laid to waste under a sky full of cloud and smoke. The cosy world of a Dutch town has been turned inside out. A body is being carried over a canal bridge. Houses stand ruined, their charred rafters open to the cold sky. A row of trees have all had their leaves blasted off. Their skeletal bleakness is terrifying. As shocked citizens help the wounded and search the rubble, birds fly darkly against the iron clouds.\nAmong the victims in catastrophe was the painter Carel Fabritius. Born in 1622, this gifted artist was killed in 1654 when a magazine containing at least 90,000 pounds of gunpowder blew up in the heart of Delft. His life was taken, at the age of 32, by this absurd, random accident. The Dutch republic was armed to guard its independence – as Rembrandt’s The Night Watch (1642) illustrates – but the explosion in Delft did not happen in a battle or invasion. It was a meaningless disaster. Someone was careless with a match.\nThe casual cruelty of Fabritius’s death oddly illuminates his art. The Goldfinch sits on its perch in a Dutch house, chained by the foot, a pet with nowhere to go. The date on the painting – 1654 – reveals he painted it in the year he was killed. But even without knowing that, we feel its enigmatic melancholy. Dutch 17th-century art has an eye for the overlooked, the ordinary, the taken for granted. In 1660, Vermeer, the other genius who worked in Delft, painted a servant pouring milk: he looked hard at the battered kitchen wall, the flow of thick white milk out of a red jug. Fabritius concentrates on the yellow, black and brown of feathers against a creamy wall, the elusive being of an animal as it perches there, thinking unknowable thoughts on its gilded rail.\nHuman beings are similarly bored and listless in Fabritius’s art. In his 1652 painting A View of Delft, now on display in the National Gallery, a musical instrument seller sits musing at his stall near a canal bridge that swoops in a grey emptiness towards the city centre. There is no one about. No customers. The lonely salesman has plenty of time to brood and think. Just like the goldfinch, he is in effect tied here – in his case by his job – with nothing to do.\nIs Fabritius the first artist who ever painted boredom? Ennui would later become a theme of French art in the age of Manet and Degas. We think of it as a quintessentially modern state of the soul. Yet this young Dutch artist was painting ennui in the 1650s. It is the mood that makes The Goldfinch such an odd and haunting masterpiece.\nThen, with no warning, he was killed in a stupid accident. Perhaps the nameless musical instrument seller sitting at his stall was killed, too, just at the moment he was about to sell a lute. For a great artist of reality like Fabritius can show us that life is more marvellous than fiction.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "We become ourselves by copying others, whether dutifully or audaciously, in acts of homage or appropriation. What is education if not a prolonged process of copying, and isn’t the same true, Nell Stevens asks in her latest novel, of falling in love? Suddenly besotted with another young woman, her protagonist Grace begins to wear her scarf at the side of the neck as her lover does, and to feel “clearer and more deliberate and more like myself” as she does so. “When we fall in love with a person, we fall in love with the copy of them, inexpertly done, that we carry around with us whenever they aren’t there.”\nAt its heart The Original has two strands of copying: both are preoccupations of the late-Victorian era the book is set in. There are the pictures made by Grace when she’s brought, penniless, to her uncle’s house aged 10 after her parents are sent to lunatic asylums (though her uncle and aunt may well be more dangerously mad than her loving parents). She copies her cousin Charles’s paintings so well that he declares her a magician – or possibly a machine – and then she makes her way to secret independence by creating clever forgeries and then successful copies of famous works of art, from Van Eyck’s Arnolfini Portrait to Velázquez’s Rokeby Venus. And there is cousin Charles himself, who is lost at sea only to return 13 years later, possibly as a brilliant fake, his jaw a little too heavy but his voice and manner so perfectly attuned to the original that his mother welcomes him delightedly back into the household. All this is playing out in a book that is at once a fake – a copy of the Victorian sensation novel – and distinctly idiosyncratic, the original the title proclaims.\nStevens is one of a generation of writers finding new ways to queer the Victorians, who were themselves already pretty queer by the late 1890s, when Grace begins to have sex with women. Stevens has written one memoir about not writing a novel and another about not writing a PhD thesis that were both rooted in fiction of the Victorian era; plus a novel, Briefly, a Delicious Life, about a ghost who falls in love with George Sand when she’s in Mallorca with Chopin. Despite its fantastical elements, Briefly is a sleek, conceptual 21st-century novel; loosely plotted, it takes its bearings from the unfolding of Sand’s own life. The moments of drama are made up of pianos arriving or failing to arrive, and doctors misdiagnosing patients. Stevens’s new novel is quite different in its flamboyantly Victorian plot. There are acts of murder and theft and betrayal and a narrator who never quite knows if she’s on the verge of total ruin or immense wealth and success.\nIt’s a risk, plotting luridly like this. One danger is that her talents will count for less than they did in Briefly, if the plot is so wilfully contrived. And her talents do lie in the realm of realism. Stevens is so casually magisterial at the hardest aspects of historical novel writing. These are bodies moving utterly convincingly through a world of solid objects: wet clothes prickling on skin; the thick, rotten smell of the Thames settling in the back of the throat; the shock of a lover’s cold fingers.\nBut, of course, all fiction is contrived, and indeed Stevens is so preoccupied by how jarring this can be that she’s already written a book about failing to make things up. Now, having put realism aside, she’s able to explore what the contrivance of art can tell us about the contrivance of life – the authenticity that may be found through faking. Grace finds herself, happily, shaking off the Victorian era and emerging into the 20th century. Soon, Duchamp will scramble all ideas of originality in art by exhibiting ordinary objects as masterpieces, and Auden will praise man as “the only creature ever made who fakes”, urging poets to write lavishly and make “a rare old proper hullabaloo” in their verses.\nThroughout, the more Victorian-plotted chapters are interspersed with aphoristic lists of statements about copying, where some combination of Stevens and Grace declares that “the value of the copy is in the copyist’s powers of empathy” and that in preserving, recycling and disseminating, the copyist engages in “an act of tremendous generosity”. Generosity and love are what have been lacking in the house where Grace and Charles grew up; they find them through copying, accepting fakery as part of homage. The kind of porousness required by love may require us to bleed into each other in ways that make any notion of originality questionable. In book after book, Stevens is showing herself to be that rare thing: a writer who we can think alongside, even while she’s making things up. All the confection here in the end helps us to appreciate the steely and witty mind that seems, four books in, to have learned to delight in that hullabaloo of fakery.\nLara Feigel is the author of Look! We Have Come Through! Living With DH Lawrence."

    "raw_text": "“Pictures or it didn’t happen.” So runs the immediate social media retort to any claim deemed too extraordinary to be true. Carried within it is an assumption shared across the globe which has held firm almost since the invention of the camera: that the ultimate form of proof is the photograph. The idea is so strongly fixed in the human mind, it has acquired the status of a law of nature, one obvious even to a child: the camera never lies.\nExcept it does, as the images collected here vividly attest. We may think of AI deepfakes, and their Photoshop predecessors, as thoroughly modern menaces, corrupting a previously innocent, reliable medium, but we would be wrong. It turns out people have been doctoring photos, manipulating and meddling, from the start. “Honest” Abe Lincoln was not only the first sitting president to be photographed, but the first to be the subject of a photo fake.\nIt’s not hard to fathom why those in the darkroom were tempted to play tricks with the technology as soon as they learned that they could. The most obvious motive is the one that fuelled so much early photographic output: PR, or propaganda. It must have seemed only natural to superimpose Lincoln’s head on to the body of another man – an enslaver, as irony would have it – if that would yield a more heroic image of the president. The same goes for the portrait of civil war general Ulysses S Grant, depicted at the centre of a military scene that was in fact three scenes combined into one. You want the leader to look as strong and noble as possible. If that means showing him on horseback, while quietly removing the handler who kept the animal under control as the snap was taken, you’ll do it – or at least you will if you’re in charge of optics for Benito Mussolini.\nThe beauty of photo manipulation for those practising politics’ black arts is it can be deployed both to make your side look better and to make the other side look worse. The North Koreans could add extra hovercraft to make their military appear more lethal, while Republicans in the 2004 US presidential campaign could put Democratic contender John Kerry alongside “Hanoi Jane” Fonda, as if the two had appeared on a platform together, denouncing the Vietnam war, a generation earlier. It never happened, but the picture says it did – and, as we all know, a picture is worth a thousand-word correction.\nPolitics is never far away, even when those in the frame are not politicians. Look no further than the darkened image of OJ Simpson that appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1994, when the former sports star became a murder suspect, the picture seemingly altered to make a Black man look blacker.\nLess than a decade later, the then editor of the Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, resigned after the paper ran staged photographs that purported to show the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. It seemed clear that the source of the pictures was motivated by opposition to the war, but that same sentiment surely also explained Morgan’s readiness to be taken in by them. After all, British soldiers had committed abuses in Iraq. Sometimes, that’s how fakes sneak through: though false, they point to a truth.\nBut if the political benefits, and dangers, of fakery are obvious, more intriguing are the manipulated images that serve no such clear purpose. Vanity can play a role – including that of the photographers, seeking acclaim as even more accomplished artists than they already are. Witness the forensic evidence suggesting Robert Capa’s stunning image of a falling soldier is likely to have been posed.\nMoney is a factor, naturally. The bigfoot footage might have been a commercial scam, although if it was, it was one that required an almost obsessive commitment. Even revenge can drive someone to concoct an optical illusion: think of the hunter of the Loch Ness monster who, humiliated by the Daily Mail, got his own back by duping them with an image of the sea monster that was too good to be true.\nBut more mysterious are those fakes that have no clear explanation. The prankster who concocted a snap of himself on the roof of one of the twin towers just before a plane crashed into the building did it as a poor taste joke, to be circulated among his friends. Yet we know there are others who claimed, falsely but in earnest, that they survived 9/11 or other terror attacks. What accounts for that, beyond the desire for attention, to be at the centre of a historic event?\nOf course, none of it would work without us, the viewer. Fake images proliferate and endure because they show us what we want to see. Posters of UFOs were captioned “I want to believe” for a reason. They realise fantasies, or dreads, that would otherwise linger only in our imaginations. They make our dreams – or our nightmares – come true.\nPicture captions by Felix Bazalgette, Gabrielle Schwarz and Emma Loffhagen\nLeap into the Void, 1960\nBy Yves Klein\nIn 1960, French artist Yves Klein stunned the world with Leap into the Void, an image that appeared to capture him mid-flight, fearlessly leaping from a rooftop in Paris. In reality, it was two negatives combined – and the tarpaulin held by friends was removed in post-production.\nKlein forbade photographers Harry Shunk and János Kender from revealing how they had created the photos, with Shunk claiming he was threatened with legal action. It wasn’t until 50 years later that the mechanics of the leap were fully revealed. EL\nWales family photograph, 2024\nEdited by the Princess of Wales\n“Like many amateur photographers,” the Princess of Wales said, “I do occasionally experiment with editing.” This inexpert attempt at Photoshopping might have been a mildly embarrassing royal footnote last year, were it not for the fevered context in which it was released. The princess had made unusually few public appearances in late 2023 and early 2024; a palace announcement that she was recovering from abdominal surgery did not quieten public curiosity as to her whereabouts. When this family photograph was released to mark Mother’s Day, several news agencies quickly issued a dramatic “kill notice” for it, identifying several signs of heavy editing, including around Princess Charlotte’s hand, contrary to guidelines for news images. The princess apologised “for any confusion” and later that month announced she had been diagnosed with cancer, dampening the speculation that had gripped the press. FB\nOJ Simpson on the cover of Time, 1994\nBy LAPD/Matt Mahurin\nAfter American football star OJ Simpson was charged with murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Time and Newsweek both made his mugshot their cover. But while Newsweek used the original image, Time showed Simpson’s skin drastically darkened – done, critics claimed, to make a Black man appear more threatening. Time apologised, but insisted the alteration was simply an artistic decision. EL\nMussolini on horseback, 1937\nBy Luigi Leoni\nWhen Italy first invaded and occupied Libya in 1911, Benito Mussolini, at the time a socialist, publicly opposed the colonial attack. Two decades later, the fascist Mussolini would declare himself ruler of “Italian Libya” and a “Protector of Islam”, to mark which title he was photographed in 1937 holding aloft the sword of Islam, a ceremonial weapon.\nThe original image, taken by photojournalist Luigi Leoni and showing a groom dutifully holding the leader’s horse, initially appeared on newspaper front pages – but editors soon learned to crop and airbrush out the groom, to better foster the image of an independent, aristocratic, warlike leader. By the 1940s, the image without the groom had become the standard version, and it created the enduring visual signs of the strongman leader – when Nigel Farage makes a speech atop a tank, or Vladimir Putin displays his bare chest, both are drawing on iconography developed by the Italian fascist. FB\nFrame 352 of the bigfoot film, 1967\nBy Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin\nNo other scrap of film – apart from perhaps the Zapruder footage showing JFK’s assassination – has been so exhaustively analysed as the Patterson-Gimlin film, named for the two cowboys who shot it, Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin. In October 1967 the two men rode into the woods of northern California with a camera after a number of sasquatch, or bigfoot, sightings in the area. As the hairy figure emerged, Patterson said, his horse panicked and reared up; after a few seconds, he was able to grab his camera from a saddlebag and record a short snatch of footage, before the creature disappeared into the tree line. Frame 352, of the figure turning to look at the camera, remains the iconic image of the bigfoot movement.\n“The Patterson-Gimlin film stands at a crucial place in photographic history,” says Steven Streufert, who has made a long-term study of the footage. “It’s either the greatest hoax ever or a stunning piece of wildlife imagery.” Streufert co-led an expedition in 2011 to identify the film’s remote wooded location, an effort that led to him being named Bigfoot Times’s Bigfooter of the Year.\nFor Streufert, the film stands “closer to the moon landing than the Cottingley fairies” as, unlike the latter, it has never been conclusively debunked and still inspires obsessive study. Patterson died a few years after it was filmed, while Gimlin, now in his 90s, maintains that the footage shows a real sasquatch.\nTo true believers (and some scientifically trained commentators), the figure has inhuman proportions, a distinct gait and visible muscle mass moving beneath its fur, all of which would be difficult to achieve if it was a person wearing a furry suit. Comparisons with the unconvincing costumes in the Planet of the Apes, released a year later, suggest that if they were faking it, Patterson and Gimlin – both rodeo riders and horse wranglers – were highly skilled costume designers for their time.\n“I’m a sceptic,” Streufert says, reflecting on his lifelong engagement with the film, “but to me that means being curious.” The footage, and the culture around it, is compelling to him because of the broader question it poses: “Why do humans believe in things that are not supposed to exist?” FB\nThe Book of Veles, 2021\nBy Jonas Bendiksen\nPhotojournalist Jonas Bendiksen first heard about the run-down North Macedonian city of Veles in 2016, when it was identified as a hub for fake news production in the US presidential election. Around then, he also became aware of computer-generated images, and “wanted to test whether we were prepared for a world where we cannot tell CGI from photojournalism”.\nThe Book of Veles (a title borrowed from a known literary forgery, which purported to be an ancient Slavic text) is the result. Using 3D modelling tools, Bendiksen inserted digital avatars into empty backdrops shot in Veles, claiming they were real portraits of tech-savvy local youths who had found an unlikely source of income operating websites that churned out pro-Trump stories. He published the images in a photobook alongside an essay written with a prototype of ChatGPT.\nTo Bendiksen’s surprise, no one clocked him – on the contrary, he was invited to present the project at a prestigious photojournalism festival. So he decided to drop clues on social media, creating a fake user who accused him of paying his subjects. Eventually a real user, Benjamin Chesterton, noticed that the fake account’s profile picture looked like one of the avatars in the book.\n“It shows we see what we want to see,” says Bendiksen. “If something is packaged up in the right way and conforms to what we expect, we are at risk of buying into anything.” GS\nAbraham Lincoln portrait, 1865\nBy William Pate\nThe US president’s assassination in 1865 led to demand for heroic portraits of him – and to one printmaker getting a little too creative. In this print, attributed to engraver William Pate, the Great Emancipator’s head is superimposed on to an engraving of John C Calhoun, a political rival and supporter of slavery. The source photo was flipped, so Lincoln’s mole appears on the wrong side of his face. GS\nAlpine UFOS, 1970s\nBy Billy Meier\nIn 1976 the unusual claims of a Swiss man began to appear in the press. Eduard “Billy” Meier maintained he had made contact with a race of aliens hailing from the Pleiades, and offered as proof dreamy images of their spaceships over rolling alpine landscapes – supposedly taken with their permission. In the coming decades, Meier would release a flood of such images, write bestselling books about his alien friends and become a media fixture and countercultural icon. Mulder’s office in The X-Files features one of his images, with the slogan “I want to believe”.\nJulio Rojas, a writer and film-maker who has spent the last two years making a documentary about Meier, says the pictures are “possibly the most beautiful ever captured of an unidentified flying object”. Though many, including Meier’s ex-wife, have observed that some of the UFOs are clearly household objects such as bin lids, Rojas finds the images fascinating – not only because they “established the visual canon” of flying saucer imagery, but also for their beauty and variety, “ranging from technical awe to deliberately careless and mocking images”, which seem to taunt the viewer.\nMeier, now 88, insists his images depict a race of aliens who have been in contact with him for decades. Interviewing him, Rojas thought he perceived “a quiet certainty” rather than an intention to deceive. “His world – whether real or false to us – is entirely real to him.” FB\nBaby Hitler, 1933\nBy Acme Newspictures\n“They’ve made a sourpuss out of my son,” complained Harriet May Warren Downs to Life magazine on 2 May 1938. Five years earlier, doctored images of her baby, purporting to show the newly elected fuhrer as a one-year-old, had been distributed by Acme Newspictures. “This is a picture of a man who controls the destiny of a mighty nation,” said the Winnipeg Free Press, while the Chicago Tribune ran the picture next to one of Hitler as an adult, addressing a meeting of farmers.\nThe latter caused a diplomatic scandal, with the German consulate complaining of blatant “falsification”. The Tribune blamed the picture agency, which “insisted the original came from Austria”, according to Life. Downs’s letter, about “the dreadful monstrosity”, would finally confirm the true identity of the baby, but the hoaxer who stole and doctored the image remains a mystery. FB\nNorth Korean hovercraft, 2013\nBy Korean Central News Agency\nAmid heightened tensions, with the US and South Korea carrying out military drills, the North Koreans released a series of photos of a hovercraft assault drill on a desolate, snowy beach. The images had already been distributed by some western news agencies, in0cluding AFP and Getty, before Alan Taylor, an editor at the Atlantic, spotted some “digital twins”, cloned by a photo editor to create a more menacing impression of multiple hovercraft bearing down on the beach. FB\nRalph Lauren Blue Label jeans poster, 2009\nBy Ralph Lauren\nWhile photo editing has long been standard practice in fashion, one 2009 incident broke the unspoken boundaries of acceptability. In a poster for Ralph Lauren Blue Label jeans, the fashion house so severely slimmed a photo of 23-year-old Swedish-French model Filippa Hamilton (a UK size eight) that her head ended up appearing bigger than her pelvis.\nThe results were ridiculed online, and Ralph Lauren was forced to apologise, saying, “We have learned that we are responsible for the poor imaging and retouching that resulted in a very distorted image of a woman’s body.”\nThe saga took another turn when Hamilton claimed she had been fired by Ralph Lauren for being “too fat”. On the US TV show Today, she said she had received a letter stating, “We’re terminating your services because you don’t fit into the sample clothes you need to wear.”\nHamilton said of the Photoshop debacle, “They owe American women an apology … I’m very proud of what I look like, and a role model should look healthy.” EL\nThe Cottingley fairies, 1920\nBy Frances Griffiths and Elsie Wright\nOne day in the summer of 1917, nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her 16-year-old cousin Elsie Wright went down to the stream at the foot of their family garden in West Yorkshire. They took a camera – to get proof, they said, that fairies lived there, as Frances had always told her parents that was the reason she kept coming home with wet shoes. This is the fourth of five images the girls captured over a few years at Cottingley Beck – in some you can almost detect a mischievous glint in Frances’s eyes.\nMerrick Burrow, an academic and curator of an exhibition of the Cottingley fairy photos, describes them as an “accidental hoax”. “The prank was intended only for their immediate family, and it was only after Arthur Conan Doyle got wind of the photos that they reached wider attention.” Doyle was (somewhat incongruously, as creator of the arch-rationalist detective Sherlock Holmes) a dedicated spiritualist – these photos, he argued, clearly established the reality of the supernatural realm.\nAmazingly, they weren’t conclusively debunked until the 1980s, when the cousins finally admitted they had staged the scenes using hatpins to prop up cut-out drawings of fairies based on children’s book illustrations, then disposed of the evidence in a stream. Until her death, however, Frances still claimed that the last photograph the pair took was real. GS\nElvis gets a buzzcut, 1957\nBy United Press\nWhen it was announced in 1957 that, at the height of his fame, Elvis was to be drafted into the US army, it was his hair that quickly became the focus of media attention. His legions of fans were so worried about him having to shave his signature pompadour and sideburns that some politicians even investigated whether he could get an exemption from military buzzcut regulations.\nAmid the furore, the United Press agency decided to create a mock-up of what the king of rock’n’roll might look like with the typical GI hairstyle, retouching a photo of the singer to remove his quiff (and leaving him with a somewhat disfigured head). “Not all manipulated photographs are intended to deceive,” notes Mia Fineman, a curator at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and author of Faking It: Manipulated Photography before Photoshop.\nThe following year, hordes of photographers and reporters gathered at an army training centre in Arkansas to document the real thing. The widely circulated photographs of Presley’s actual army haircut have long since eclipsed the imagined version. EL\nGeneral Grant at City Point, 1902\nBy LC Handy\nThis one-time historical document, depicting Union forces commander Ulysses S Grant at City Point, Virginia, during the American civil war, sat quietly in the US Library of Congress for more than a hundred years before a reference assistant at the prints and photographs division raised questions about it in 2007. Kathryn Blackwell noticed a number of anomalies: the strange angle of the famous general’s neck; the stiff, uncertain pose for someone known to be an expert rider; the horse that does not resemble any of Grant’s known horses; and the uniform, which did not reflect Grant’s rank. Blackwell established that the image was actually a composite of three photographs – the general’s head, a major general’s body and horse, and a background of Confederate prisoners – probably produced by photographer LC Handy for commercial purposes in 1902, well after the American civil war. FB\nRoosevelt on a moose, 1912\nBy Underwood and Underwood\nTeddy Roosevelt was famously outdoorsy, but this cut-and-paste image was debunked soon after it appeared online 15 years ago, when the archives of the photography firm that produced it, Underwood and Underwood, were digitised. It was part of a triptych of 1912’s presidential candidates, each atop the animal associated with their party; Roosevelt’s new Progressives were nicknamed the Bull Moose party.\nGoing Places, 1998\nBy the Leeds 13\nIn May 1998, art students from the University of Leeds, later dubbed the Leeds 13, pulled off one of the most notorious media hoaxes in British history. As part of a conceptual art project, they documented a fake luxury holiday to Spain, photographing themselves sunbathing, swimming and sipping cocktails, supposedly on the Costa del Sol, in a trip funded by a university grant.\nIn reality, the group never left the UK. Using inflatable paddling pools, sunbed tans and carefully angled shots, they staged the photos in a project titled Going Places, even going so far as to film themselves coming through arrivals at Leeds Bradford airport.\nSensationalist headlines followed, with tabloids condemning the group’s supposed misuse of taxpayers’ money. A few days later, they revealed live on Radio 4 that the whole thing had been staged. “We had to disappear for a week, laying low in our student houses and only nipping to the corner shop in disguise,” recalls one member of the group, who wants to remain anonymous. “Until the moment we walked out of arrivals, hauling luggage and gifts supposedly from the Costa del Sol, we lived in a perpetual state of paranoia.” All the Leeds 13 received a first for their final exams. EL\nAbraham Lincoln’s ghost, 1870\nBy William H Mumler\nBefore “ghosts” started to appear on William H Mumler’s photographic plates in the early 1860s, spiritualism had been a religious movement defined by knocks and taps, seances and mediums. Now spirit photography spread around the world. Mumler credited the images to the “wonderful magnetic powers” of his wife, a medium, but sceptics claimed they were simple double exposures, and Mumler was hauled into court in the late 1860s, after he had made a fortune selling his images to Americans grieving after the civil war. He was ultimately acquitted for lack of evidence, but not before his reputation had been ruined.\nAfter the trial, Mary Todd Lincoln, the famous spiritualist and widow of Abraham Lincoln, visited Mumler to test his powers, leading to his most famous image. According to his autobiography, she used a false name and hid her identity with a veil up until the moment the photograph was taken. When the figure of her husband appeared on the plate, Mumler’s wife reported that Mary wept “tears of joy”. FB\nFalling Soldier, 1936\nBy Robert Capa\n“It happened in Spain,” Robert Capa recalled in a radio interview 11 years after the photograph was taken. “It was very much at the beginning of my career.” He recalled how he huddled in a trench with Republican soldiers, taking cover from fascist machine-gun fire. As a few doomed soldiers tried to charge the enemy, Capa held his camera above his head and snapped a picture without looking; he sent the undeveloped films straight to an editor in France, never seeing the image of a soldier at the moment he was shot until he returned from the war months later. By then it had been published in the French magazine Vu to great acclaim, establishing his reputation at just 22.\nThat, at least, was Capa’s story. After his death in 1954, people began to ask questions about the image – was it really taken at the Battle of Cerro Muriano on 5 September 1936? Does it really show someone being shot? For Professor José Manuel Susperregui, at the University of the Basque Country, study of the image has become his life’s work. “What caught my attention,” Susperregui says over email, “was the geometric shape of light-coloured terrain in the lower right corner. It seemed strange to me, and became my main reference for locating the photograph.”\nSusperregui couldn’t find this distinctive form in the landscape of Cerro Muriano, so he assembled a wider panorama of the area from other photos Capa took on the same day, and circulated it to town halls across the country, asking for assistance. Eventually a student recognised it as a piece of open ground known locally as Llano de Vanda – 55km south of the frontline at the time the image was supposed to have been taken. This cast doubt on Capa’s tales of trenches and machine gunners.\nSusperregui’s work has brought him into conflict with powerful photography institutions, including Magnum, the agency founded by Capa, and the International Centre of Photography in New York. The image still provokes debate; some argue its symbolic value is more important than whether it was staged. Susperregui is not convinced: “According to press photography association statutes, no staging or falsification is allowed.” FB\nIraqi detainee, 2004\nHoaxer unknown\nOn 1 May 2004, the Daily Mirror published a series of incendiary images apparently depicting the abuse of an Iraqi detainee by the Queen’s Lancashire regiment in Basra. The photographs, published just days after the infamous images of abuse by the US army in Abu Ghraib, seemed to show British soldiers beating a handcuffed prisoner and urinating on him. Prime minister Tony Blair condemned the images as “utterly unacceptable” and foreign secretary Jack Straw promised a thorough investigation.\nWithin two weeks, however, the editor who had published them – one Piers Morgan – would be leaving in disgrace, after military sources insisted the images were fake: the rifle seen was not issued to soldiers in Iraq, nor were the hats they wore, and the truck shown was not used there at the time. They argued, therefore, that the images were staged. Morgan was sacked on 14 May.\nThe furore threatened to overshadow the fact that regiment members were linked to horrific abuses in Iraq, including the torture of 26-year-old hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, who later died of his injuries. Though nobody was convicted, an inquiry found serious failings in army leadership, planning and training had led to the abuse, with British soldiers inflicting “violent and cowardly” assaults on Iraqi civilians. Morgan has continued to stand by his decision to publish the images, telling Politico in 2013, “I refuse to apologise. And to accept they were necessarily fakes.” FB\nThe doomed tourist on 9/11, 2001\nBy Peter Guzli\nIn the days after the September 11 attacks, a chain email with a photograph of a man on the observation deck of the World Trade Center, seemingly moments before one of the planes hit, started doing the rounds. “This was from a camera found in the wreckage,” the message claimed. “The guy still has no name and is missing.” Soon he was identified as Peter Guzli, a very much alive Hungarian tourist who had digitally edited a holiday snap taken four years earlier (a “joke intended for my friends only”, he later insisted).\nIn retrospect there were obvious clues of fakery, not least the heavy coat worn by Guzli on a warm September day. “Tourist Guy” soon became a meme, appearing in online images at the sites of other historical disasters, from the sinking of the Titanic to JFK’s assassination. GS\nSnowball the giant cat, 2000\nBy Cordell Hauglie\n“My daughter wanted to send an electronic photo of her cat to her friend,” Cordell Hauglie told reporters. “I got a little carried away.” The image, a modest experiment with Photoshop, spread across the internet, often with a tongue-in-cheek report blaming atomic radiation. It sparked arguments online and was even featured on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Good Morning America. The experience led Hauglie to warn about “the dangers of email … if some dumb guy and his dumb cat can go around the world, you’ve got to be careful”. FB\nJohn Kerry and Jane Fonda, 2004\nBy Richard Taylor\nThis image, appearing to show presidential candidate John Kerry next to Jane Fonda at an anti-Vietnam war rally in the 1970s, was part of a rightwing smear campaign focused on his military record. Kerry, a Vietnam vet, had spoken out against the war – but this scene linking him to “Hanoi Jane” never happened. A man called Richard Taylor had digitally spliced together two photos and added a fake headline and credit to create the look of an old newspaper clipping. Several media outlets, including The New York Times, ran the image before it was debunked.\nPhotographer Ken Light, who shot the original Kerry photo in 1971, was “incredibly upset” and, looking back, thinks this image influenced the election: “A colleague told me his father was going to vote for Bush because of it.”\nHis advice for spotting fake images today? “Trust the photographer, know the source. Look closely – if photos seem too fantastic, they probably are.” GS\nHelicopter Shark, 2001\nHoaxer unknown\nHelicopter Shark spread like wildfire across the internet in 2001, the text assuring viewers that “although this looks like a picture taken from a Hollywood movie, it is in fact a real photo”. It was in fact two real photos: Charles Maxwell’s shark and Lance Cheung’s US air force helicopter. The text also stated this was National Geographic’s photograph of the year, a claim the magazine had to publicly deny.\nTo this day the hoaxer is unknown. “I’d like to make contact,” Maxwell said at the time, “not to get him or her into trouble, but because it’s fun and a good job.” FB\nJennifer in Paradise, 1987\nBy John Knoll\nJohn Knoll took this photograph of his future wife Jennifer (“The next day I proposed to her”) on a beach on the South Pacific island of Bora Bora in 1987. Back home, he and his brother Thomas started using “Jennifer in Paradise” to demo the new image-editing software they were developing, doing things like cloning her figure or adding another island. “It presented good opportunities to show the capabilities of the tool we were building and I found it pleasant to look at,” says Knoll, who keeps a copy of the first test image – untampered with – as a personal memento. After Adobe bought Photoshop in 1988 and released it in 1990, the brothers’ creation went on to became a worldwide phenomenon. GS\nSelf-Portrait as a Drowned Man, 1840\nBy Hippolyte Bayard\nIn 1839, to much fanfare, the French government announced it had obtained the rights to the daguerreotype – and would give it “free to the world”. Billed as the first viable photographic process, it was named for inventor Louis Daguerre. But fellow Frenchman Hippolyte Bayard felt unjustly overlooked as creator of the equally viable “direct positive” process. In response, he staged this dark joke: an image of himself apparently driven to suicide by neglect of his work. “The corpse you see here is Monsieur Bayard, inventor of the process you have just seen,” he wrote on the back of the print. GS\nThe Balenciaga pope, 2023\nBy Pablo Xavier\nThe danger of deepfake tech was memorably demonstrated when this shot of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket went viral in March 2023. It was made using Midjourney, an AI tool that turns text prompts into images. The eagle-eyed may spot clues to its origins, such as the wonky shadow cast by the pope’s glasses and the strange grip of his hand – not to mention the unlikelihood of his flashy attire. But many were fooled.\nThe image’s creator, a man from Chicago called Pablo Xavier (he withheld his surname, fearing a backlash), told reporters he’d been messing around with Midjourney for a laugh: “I just thought it was funny to see the Pope in a funny jacket.” GS\nThe Loch Ness monster, 1934\nBy Robert Kenneth Wilson\nAmong more than 1,100 reported sightings of the monster said to inhabit the Scottish Highlands loch – including one in January this year – none has made as big a splash as the “surgeon’s photograph”, credited to a physician named Robert Kenneth Wilson and published in the Daily Mail in 1934.\nMany were sceptical, but no one could explain the photo either – until the 1990s, when retired art teacher Alastair Boyd unearthed a little-read article from 1975 in which a man called Ian Wetherell admitted helping stage the image. His father Marmaduke, a big-game hunter, had wanted to get back at the Mail after they debunked his previous claim to have found Nessie’s footprints (actually from a cast made of a hippo’s feet). The long-necked creature seen here was fabricated from wood putty attached to a toy submarine – later sunk in the mud when a water bailiff approached – and Wilson was recruited as a frontman to submit the photos. Despite what he’d uncovered, Boyd remained convinced of Nessie’s existence: “I would stake my life on it,” he said. GS\nStalin and Nikolai Yezhov, 1937\nPhotographer unknown\nThe era of Stalinist purges in the late 1930s, with its dizzying re-evaluation of political figures and past events, was a busy time for photo retouchers. “So much falsification took place during the Stalin years,” wrote the author and collector David King, “that it is possible to tell the story of the Soviet era through retouched photographs.” King’s book from 1997, The Commissar Vanishes, documents how retouchers – working by hand, using brushes, scissors and glue – diligently removed from the historical record figures who had fallen out of favour (they even smoothed out Stalin’s pockmarks).\nLeon Trotsky was a common target, systematically erased from many photographs documenting his prominent role in the Russian Revolution of 1917. Another famous victim was Nikolai Yezhov, Stalin’s one-time confidant, who went from being head of the NKVD, the secret police, to execution in little more than three years. In the original of this image, Stalin walks with Yezhov next to the Moscow-Volga canal; after his fall from favour, he was scrubbed out.

    "raw_text": "When the virtual auction bell rang at Christie’s on Thursday, Mike Winkelmann, a digital artist better known as Beeple, made history: he had sold a “non-fungible token” representing his piece Everydays: The First 5,000 Days, for $69.4m.\nBut while the new cryptocurrency craze may have brought the high-end art market into the 21st century, it’s also modernising another aspect of the industry: art thieves.\nAt their simplest, non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, can be thought of as “bitcoin for art”. Just as bitcoin created the ability to spend and save a sort of digital money without any centralised authority, so too do NFTs allow for pictures, videos, music, or anything else that can be digitally represented, to be wrapped up in a format that can be traded, stored or authenticated without needing to turn to a gatekeeper.\nOnce an NFT is created, it can be digitally traced for ever. And unlike a simple image file, for instance, an NFT can’t be duplicated, giving it a similar cachet to an original artwork, and enabling the sort of transactions that have seen the field garner mainstream interest over the last month.\nBut while the very technology of NFTs prevents them from being duplicated without permission, there’s nothing inherent to the sector that controls who can make an NFT in the first place – a fact that has caused dismay to some artists, who have found their work ending up in the “control” of people who had nothing to do with its creation.\nSimon Stålenhag, the Swedish illustrator whose Tales from the Loop has become an Amazon Prime original, is one. On Wednesday, he found that one of his artworks had been turned into a “MarbleCard”, a type of NFT that allows users to make and trade tokens representing web pages. “I guess we must do a daily google if we’ve been NFT:d from now on,” he said. “Thanks Silicon Valley!”\nMarbleCard isn’t the only NFT service that makes it trivial to “tokenise” other people’s content. Another, Tokenized Tweets, lets users turn any tweet into a tradable digital asset simply by sending a message on the social network, and artworks posted to the site have been a popular target for tokenisation. “Now people can sell your tweets all without your permission,” warned the artist RJ Palmer, whose own images were tokenised without his permission.\nEmma Price, an artist and designer based in Margate, cited Palmer’s experience, as well as the enormous environmental damage of the cryptocurrency sector, in taking a stand against NFTs. “Very quickly it became clear that a lot of non-creative, often faceless, entities were jumping in to exploit all manner of ways to create and distribute NFTs, with little care afforded to an originator’s ownership of a digital item.\n“There’s no oversight here, and seemingly no understanding of or respect for copyright. The unscrupulous way that it allows artists to be ripped off is maddening.”\nWhile NFT systems that encourage users to tokenise web pages or tweets they do not own were always likely to invite trouble, even more conventional systems that allow for artists to tokenise their own works have caused controversy. The Wu Tang Clan’s foray into the area last week was aborted after the artist Kevin Alexander objected that the animation was similar to an artwork he had posted online in 2013.\nSometimes, the boundary blurring is deliberate, as with the Burned Banksy NFT. This token, which sold for around £300,000, is an image of a Banksy print titled Morons, which was sold in an edition of 500. But the specific print that has been tokenised, number 325, was publicly burned as the token was minted, a move the anonymous creators argue “moved the value of the physical piece on to the NFT”.\nEven for those digital artists who view 20th-century copyright norms as outdated, though, the trend is raising concern. “In a sense, the NFT sector should be more attentive to what is offending and upsetting people – especially the artists whose work is attracting interest to their field – than strictly what is technically or legally possible,” says Parker Higgins, a New-York-based artist and activist who has campaigned for copyright reform.\n“In many other creative areas, norms and customs are more influential than the specific contours of copyright law, where the price of transgression is not necessarily a lawsuit but still very real. Sure, people in the NFT space can choose to ‘move fast and break things’ through those considerations, but they risk coming across as antisocial weirdos that nobody wants to associate with.”"

    "raw_text": "Asked for a definition of intellectual property and ChatGPT answered: “IP refers to creations of the mind that are legally recognized and protected from unauthorized use by others.” The bot’s summary helpfully ended: “Intellectual property laws exist to encourage innovation and creativity by granting creators exclusive rights over their work for a certain period.\nToo bad that the tech giants behind such artificial intelligence (AI) tools have chosen to play fast and loose with the rules. As Silicon Valley bosses were expressing concerns about “the distillation” of their models with the launch of the Chinese DeepSeek chatbot earlier this week, the House of Lords was debating legislation to protect against unfettered data crawling by AI.\nSir Elton John has joined Sir Paul McCartney in calling for new rules to prevent tech companies from riding “roughshod over the traditional copyright laws that protect artists’ livelihoods”. A petition against the unlicensed use of creative works for training generative AI now has more than 40,000 signatories including Julianne Moore, Kazuo Ishiguro, Kate Bush and Sir Simon Rattle. It is a battle that has united artists of every kind.\nThey are outraged at UK government plans to weaken copyright laws, and are urging greater transparency, control and financial remuneration to counter the challenge of AI.\nThe UK has a “gold standard” copyright regime and the oldest in the world. The Statute of Anne, passed in 1710, gave authors the right to control their work. Now the government is seeking to turn this law on its head by proposing exemptions, where the onus would be on the rights holder to opt out of their content being taken free of charge, and for them to trace how it is being used.\nKate Mosse, the bestselling author and co-founder of the Women’s prize for fiction, likens the AI model to a thief stealing all the Mars bars from a shop on the grounds that no one told them they weren’t allowed to do to so. The peer, film‑maker and digital rights campaigner Beeban Kidron has said we should not “redefine the notion of theft”. Her amendment to the government’s data bill, stating that data is licensed by default, was accepted by the House of Lords on Tuesday.\nIn the UK, adapting a novel for TV or film needs permission and payment unless it is public domain. Covering a song? No permission needed, but royalties apply – unless the lyrics or melody is changed, which requires consent. Even reproducing lyrics requires both permission and a fee, unless fair dealing applies. ChatGPT “knows” this and it cannot reproduce song words “due to copyright restrictions”. As Philip Pullman notes: “The principle is simple ... if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it”.\nLabour must not be dazzled by the shininess of the tech industry and the promise of endless growth. To favour these businesses at the expense of the creative sector, the second most lucrative in the UK, generating more than £126bn annually, would impoverish more than our economy.\nBoth industries are at an impasse: tech insisting that enforcing copyright laws on AI is unfeasible and regressive, creatives that opting out is unworkable and unjust. It is up to government to foster a fair agreement in which both flourish. This is a pivotal moment for our cultural future. The artistic community has spoken. Now ministers must listen, take their concerns seriously and respond. We must protect our creators at all costs.\n-\nDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

    "raw_text": "On a table in a study room at the new V&A East Storehouse, a silk-embroidered Alexander McQueen dress decorated with Hieronymus Bosch paintings has been laid out for me to see intimately. Creatures from The Garden of Earthly Delights cavort and gurn in my face, including a bird monster perched on a high stool that defecates out sinners. Ah, the privileges of a critic – except it isn’t my special experience at all. This opportunity for a personal encounter with an exquisite object is available to everyone and anyone, free of charge, as part of this unprecedented reinvention of the Victoria & Albert Museum that is V&A East Storehouse. It isn’t even difficult to arrange. All you do is look up the collection online and, if an object is in the Storehouse, you add it to your cart of up to five treasures, place an order, and in a fortnight they will be available for your private delight.\nYou can choose anything from theatre posters to Renaissance paintings to shoes. If they’re movable they will be brought to the study room, if not you go to them. I recommend the Ajanta paintings in the ground floor storage facility where I found one towering over me, its damaged parts covered with what looked like sticking plasters, adding to the mystery of this great mass of red and green out of which emerge sharply portrayed people. It’s a full-size copy of one of the Ajanta cave paintings in India – one of 300 made for the V&A in the late 19th century by a team from Bombay School of Art.\nBy the time I found this tremendous document of world art, I was already floating. Curators traditionally decide how to contextualise and arrange a museum’s objects and most invidiously how much of a public collection is on view and how much hidden in stores. Here everything is on view, at the time and in the arrangement of your choosing. If you can’t be bothered with the Order an Object service, you can simply wander this cabinet of curiosities for the people, exploring the nation’s Victorian attic.\nAfter you enter through heavy protective doors, lungs full of tar fumes from the roadworks along the perimeter of Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the artworks start coming immediately in a walkway stuffed with sculptures including a bust of Dante – which is ominous given his Inferno has a gate inscribed “Abandon hope all you who enter here”. But this Dante leads to enchantment. You stand nervously on a glass floor looking down on a massive yet elegant colonnade built in the 1630s for the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (creator of the Taj Mahal) for his personal hammam in the Red Fort at Agra. What a rare, sensual treasure. The wonder of the Storehouse is the way it makes you feel close to art, as if you owned it – which is as it should be with a national collection. There is abundance everywhere you look – Andalusian column capitals, a statue of Buddha, a giant Georgian doll’s house – mixed as randomly yet lovingly as objects in someone’s home. Their beauty is unleashed, free of captions, asking only to be enjoyed.\nThat goes plus size for The Biggest Picasso in the World. Two colossal women are running on a beach, their powerful limbs thick and fleshy, hand-in-hand, hair flying. In Picasso’s small original 1922 painting Two Women Running on the Beach, they are heroic, but here they are actually giants. It was copied for the 1924 Ballets Russes production Le Train Bleu in just 24 hours. Picasso was so impressed he signed it as an authentic Picasso – his signature, too, is colossal.\nWhat does it all mean? I suppose it would be possible to dismiss this as a brainless treasury, the reduction of great art to blissful entertainment. But when you open up the entire contents of a museum collection and show them as a single aesthetic marvel, the museum itself becomes the object of scrutiny. Seeing Bodhisattva, Donatello’s Virgin Mary and, in my private study selection, an Islamic astrolabe (an ancient astronomical instrument) all in the same place, you can’t help wondering how they all got here.\nThe V&A East Youth Collective Community wondered too. In a side aisle, their selection of apparently random global treasures are connected by one thing: “An enslaver we choose not to name,” says the text, who spent an ill-gotten fortune on these things.\nFrom one point of view everything here can be seen this way – this enslaver’s collection is a microcosm of the sins of a colonial museum. By opening itself up so completely, V&A East Storehouse offers critique as well as celebration. Is that propagandist? Only if you can show how a global collection formed by Victorian Britain when we ruled the waves somehow doesn’t have anything to do with the British empire. Still, it would be better history to name the enslaver.\nThis is what the museum of the future looks like – an old idea that’s now been turned inside out, upside down, disgorging its secrets, good and bad, in an avalanche of beautiful questions, created with curiosity, generous imagination and love."

    "raw_text": "Ange Postecoglou is the frontrunner to replace Nuno Espírito Santo as the new Nottingham Forest head coach, after the Portuguese was relieved of his duties in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\nThe Australian was sacked by Tottenham at the end of the season, despite winning the Europa League final. They suffered domestically, however, finishing 17th in the Premier League.\nPostecoglou has held talks with Forest in recent days with regards to taking over. He was eager to return to the Premier League at the earliest opportunity, with a feeling he has unfinished business in England after his departure from Tottenham and Postecoglou, who is of Greek heritage, already has a personal relationship with Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis.\nNuno’s departure felt inevitable since he said his relationship with Marinakis had deteriorated over the summer. “I cannot say that is the same, because it’s not the same,” Nuno said. “The reason behind it, I don’t know … I think everybody at the club should be together but it’s not the reality.”\nNuno was irritated by the time it took to complete transfers during the window and fell out with Forest’s new head of global football Edu. Marinakis was unhappy with Nuno going public and considered severing ties with the head coach sooner but in the end waited until international week. Forest’s sporting director Ross Wilson was the one who delivered the news to Nuno.\n“Nottingham Forest Football Club confirms that, following recent circumstances, Nuno Espírito Santo has today been relieved of his duties as head coach,” said a club statement in the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n“The club thanks Nuno for his contribution during a very successful era at the City Ground, in particular his role in the 2024-25 season, which will forever be remembered fondly in the history of the club. As someone who played a pivotal role in our success last season, he will always hold a special place in our journey.”\nMarinakis has previously praised Postecoglou, who started his European managerial career with Greek third division side Panachaiki. Postecoglou was born in Athens before moving to Australia as a young boy.\n“What he achieved, he did with a team that has not won any titles, it has had a very difficult time in recent years. In this huge success that the whole world saw, he promoted Greece,” Marinakis said when presenting him with an award in Greece following his Europa League triumph.\n“We must thank him especially for this and we wish him well, although we are sure that he will do well as he has the ability. Wherever he goes, the successes will come.”\nNuno leaves Forest as their most successful coach since Frank Clark, having qualified for the Europa League."

    "raw_text": "“The players stayed, looked at each other and started to cry,” says Andreas Samaris of the moment Ange Postecoglou announced he was leaving the Greek third division side Panachaiki after nine effective months in charge.\nTottenham’s head coach is managing his third European club after two seasons of success in Scotland with Celtic. The Australian has certainly come a long way since working in Greek regional football 15 years ago.\nIt was a homecoming for Postecoglou, who left Greece with his family four decades earlier and moved to Australia when he was five years old. He spent his playing career in the country and collected four caps for the Socceroos. After spells managing South Melbourne and Australia age group teams, Postecoglou wanted to test himself in Europe but trying to rebuild a fading club such as Panachaiki was a tough assignment.\nThere were positives for him when he arrived, including the up-and-coming Samaris. The academy graduate would go on to play for Olympiakos and Benfica but started out in less salubrious surroundings, laying foundations alongside his manager. “At the time we had no clue who Ange was,” Samaris says.\n“We were a bit surprised [by his appointment] but it was like a breath of fresh air for us because Panachaiki had had two or three projects that had not gone well in the one and half years we’d been in the third division, so we would be expected to lack enthusiasm.”\nThe reasons for Postecoglou’s arrival can be explained by the fact his fellow Greek-Australian Gianni Makris was financing the club. Postecoglou joined in March and moved them on to a stable footing, putting across his ideas in the hope Panachaiki could push on the next season.\n“My first impression was that he definitely did not belong there,” Samaris says. “He was so professional and methodical in the way that he worked – we had not seen anything like it before. In the first days, we felt it was something different and 100% thought it would have success. It was how professional football should be. He is an organised person and created dynamic training.\n“He kept his distance but was still close to the players, it was all very balanced and, at the same time, he was ambitious. Everything was clear for every one of us and we knew exactly what we were to do. For a third division Greek team, where usually you just put 11 players out there and play, it made a big difference compared to how we were playing before.”\nPostecoglou gave Samaris the springboard and he enjoyed a meteoric rise from the lower echelons of domestic football to winning four Portuguese titles and playing in the Champions League. The manager made the teenage Samaris a key component of a side filled with experienced players that had dropped down from higher divisions.\n“He was the first one to make me feel like I was not young. He told me: ‘You are here because you are good, because you can deliver, you are here because we can count on you,’” Samaris says. “At that point there was a well-known and very talented player named Sotiris Ninis, he was playing for Panathinaikos, making his debut at 16. For every young Greek he was living the dream.\n“There was a game I played and I didn’t perform well and Ange asked me to go to his office. He told me: ‘You are as talented a player as Ninis’ and I was playing in the third division. The other guy was in the first division and playing in European competitions. At first I said: ‘This guy is crazy, he doesn’t know Greek football.’ How could I be at the same level as Ninis when he plays for Panathinaikos and I am 18 and still in the third division? It turns out he was right.”\nIn a pedestrian league, Postecoglou instilled a high-pressing system and possession-based style as Panachaiki sought to dominate their way to promotion. By winter, he had taken them to second but he decided to walk away out of principle.\nAnother investor had arrived at the club and wanted to sign new players and hire a replacement for Postecoglou, despite the fact they were on an upward trajectory.\n“Everyone believed in the project and all the players believed in Ange from the first day to the last,” Samaris says. “This was his impact on the players. We believed in him from the first day and it was like one of the team was leaving. He hugged every one of us and left.”\nSamaris and Postecoglou would meet again when Greece travelled to play Australia in a friendly in 2016. Postecoglou was back home coaching the Socceroos and the two were put up to promote the match in front of the Sydney Opera House. “I will never forget that hug we gave each other,” Samaris says.\n“When I saw him, so many emotions came out. We both almost cried because the memories came back to our minds. We just looked at each other and we were talking with our eyes saying: ‘Look where we are now from where we were when we met’ nine years later. We both must have done something right to be here.\n“For him to coach me as a player was magical. There are very few people in my life I can share a moment like this with.”\nIf Postecoglou can build similar bonds in north London, it will be good news for Spurs."

    "raw_text": "Liverpool’s new £125m signing Alexander Isak made his first appearance of the season as a substitute for Sweden on Monday night, but he could not prevent his country falling to damaging 2-0 defeat away to Kosovo in World Cup qualifying.\nThe Swedes, who conceded a 90th-minute equaliser in a 2-2 draw away to Slovenia on Friday, went behind in the 26th minute as goalkeeper Robin Olsen blocked Elvis Rexhbecaj’s shot only for the rebound to fly off the midfielder’s shin into the net.\nVedat Muriqi made it 2-0 for Kosovo three minutes before the break and although Sweden brought on Isak on 72 minutes, they could not find a way back into the game despite also having Arsenal’s £64m striker Viktor Gyökeres on the pitch from the start.\nThe victory moves Kosovo up to second place in Group B on three points, three behind Switzerland, who thumped Slovenia 3-0 to make it two wins out of two. The Swedes are third on one point, ahead of Slovenia on goal difference. The top team in each group qualify directly for next year’s finals with the runners-up going into the playoffs.\nWhile it was a frustrating night for Isak, his former Newcastle teammate, Sandro Tonali, was the hero for Italy, scoring a stoppage-time winner to seal an extraordinary 5-4 qualifying win against Israel in Hungary.\nThe Italians scored two own goals, twice came from behind and conceded a late equaliser but somehow still won to stay in the hunt in Group I.\nIsrael took a deserved lead in the 16th minute when Manuel Locatelli diverted Dan Biton’s pullback into his own goal. Italy found the equaliser five minutes from the break when Moise Kean’s powerful low shot from outside the box found the bottom corner.\nKean forced Israel’s keeper Daniel Peretz into a save shortly after the interval but it was Israel who took the lead again in the 52nd minute, when Manor Solomon twisted and turned his way into the area before laying off a pass that Dor Peretz whipped first time beyond the reach of the Azzurri’s No 1 Gianluigi Donnarumma.\nItaly were almost immediately back on terms, with Kean smashing in a half-volley from the edge of the area. And they took the lead for the first time when Matteo Politano poked home on 58 minutes. Italy looked to have sealed the win when substitute Giacomo Raspadori netted with nine minutes remaining – only for Alessandro Bastoni’s own goal in the 87th minute to hand Israel a lifeline.\nChaos ensued, with Israel thinking they had snatched a draw when Dor Peretz headed his second in the 89th minute only for Tonali to fire in an opportunistic shot from outside the area. Italy’s head coach, Gennaro Gattuso, taking charge of the national side for only the second time, said: “We’re crazy – we conceded some absurd goals but we will hold on to this win.”\nThe victory puts Italy second in the group on nine points, ahead of Israel on goal difference with a game in hand, but three points off Norway who have also played four matches.\nDenmark’s Mikkel Damsgaard displayed the full range of his dribbling tricks as his side thumped Greece 3-0 away, grabbing the opening goal as the Danes went top of qualifying Group C ahead of Scotland on goal difference.\nDamsgaard put Denmark ahead in the 32nd minute, pirouetting and curling a superb shot past the despairing dive of Konstantinos Tzolakis for his fifth international goal. Denmark’s second came after the break when Andreas Christensen surged forward from his centre-back position before firing home from the edge of the area. Rasmus Højlund, on loan at Napoli from Manchester United, killed the game off two minutes later, tapping the ball into an empty net after Patrick Dorgu hit the post. The win leaves them level on four points with the Scots, who beat Belarus 2-0 in Hungary.\nIn Group L, Croatia thrashed Montenegro 4-0 at home to move above the Czech Republic into top spot having played one game fewer. In the same group, the Faroe Islands won 1-0 away to Gibraltar in a battle of the minnows.\nIn African qualifying, Tunisia’s Mohamed Ben Romdhane scored a 94th-minute winner as they booked their place at the World Cup finals with a 1-0 victory over hosts Equatorial Guinea. They are the second African side to qualify after Morocco booked their spot last Saturday."

    "raw_text": "Liverpool broke the British transfer record to sign Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle on deadline day but were foiled in an attempt to end a stunning window with a deal for Marc Guéhi.\nOn a contrasting day for the Premier League champions, Isak underwent a medical on Merseyside before signing a six-year contract worth around £300,000 a week. Liverpool also stepped up efforts to sign the Crystal Palace captain, Guéhi, who had a medical in London in anticipation of joining Arne Slot’s side after Steve Parish, the Palace chair, accepted £35m plus £5m in add-ons for the defender.\nBut Palace dramatically pulled the plug on the deal when they failed to sign an experienced replacement. Liverpool had submitted a deal sheet to complete the transfer after the 7pm deadline when it collapsed. A Palace bid for Brighton’s Igor Julio fell through and a move for another higher-profile centre-back also failed to materialise.\nOliver Glasner, the Palace manager, is understood to have been furious at the decision to accept Liverpool’s offer and reiterated his plea not to sell his captain during heated talks with Parish. There were even fears that the Austrian, who led Palace to their first trophy when they won the FA Cup in May, could step down after making it clear that they must keep hold of Guéhi to have a successful season.\nThe England international is in the final year of his contract at Selhurst Park and has no intention of signing an extension. Liverpool may renew their attempts to sign Guéhi in January but he could have interest from Barcelona and Bayern Munich if he becomes a free agent next summer. Parish had said after Palace’s win in the Community Shield last month that it would be in the club’s best interests to sell Guéhi rather than lose him for free.\nDespite missing out on their main central defensive target Liverpool managed to end the summer’s longest and most acrimonious transfer saga in their favour with the record signing of Isak. Liverpool had a £110m bid for the 25-year-old rejected on 1 August. Newcastle’s position at that time was that Isak was not for sale. However, his subsequent strike and public statements allied to their £70m signing of Nick Woltemade and attempts to sign either Yoane Wissa or Jørgen Strand Larsen encouraged Liverpool to submit a higher offer on Sunday night.\nNewcastle accepted a fixed fee of £125m with no add-ons. The cancellation of loyalty bonuses to Isak means the deal is effectively worth £130m to Newcastle, who paid £55m to sign Wissa from Brentford. Wissa behaved similarly to Isak to force his move to St James’ Park.\n“I want to create history. I want to win trophies,” said Isak. “That’s ultimately the biggest motivation for me and I feel like this is the perfect place for me to grow even further and to take my game to the next level and help the team as well.\n“I feel like this is the next step for me in my career. I’m super happy that I’ve been given this chance and I’m very motivated to do something well with it.”\nThe fee for Isak falls short of Newcastle’s £150m valuation but still represents a British transfer record and the second time this summer that Liverpool have broken their own transfer record. The champions paid £100m plus £16m in add-ons for Florian Wirtz in June and the Isak deal will take their total summer spending above £440m.\nIsak in effect downed tools this summer. He refused to play in a pre-season friendly against Celtic and did not go on Newcastle’s pre-season tour of Asia, citing a thigh injury. Since then he has been absent from the squad, at one stage training alone at his former club Real Sociedad, and has not spoken to the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, for more than a fortnight. Howe said pointedly on Friday that morale was strong within the Newcastle squad after a difficult opening two weeks of pre-season. Isak was part of pre-season training for only the first two weeks.\nThe centre-forward accused Newcastle of breaking a commitment that he could leave if a suitable offer came from a big club and refused overtures from the club hierarchy to reopen negotiations over a new contract. A meeting at his home last Monday proved decisive. Isak informed a delegation that included representatives of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Newcastle’s financial backers, that he would never play for the club again. The Newcastle contingent left within 45 minutes and moves were soon made to sign Woltemade.\nLiverpool’s deadline-day business did not end with Isak and Guéhi. The champions accepted an offer from Aston Villa to sign Harvey Elliott on a season’s loan with an obligation to buy the England Under-21 international for £35m next summer. Liverpool also received approaches from Milan, Brighton and Palace for Joe Gomez in the final 24 hours of the transfer window but doubts over the Guéhi deal – well founded, as it turned out – meant they did not consider letting Gomez leave. Including the £35m for Elliott, Liverpool recouped £245m in transfer fees this window.\nLiverpool believe their central defensive options of Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, Gomez and the new signing Giovanni Leoni, who is regarded as a potentially elite talent, should cover the failure to sign Guéhi."

    "raw_text": "In a truncated qualifying campaign the immediate Scottish task was not to make the road to the World Cup an even longer one within one double header. Job done on that front, with four points out of six a wholly acceptable return. The visit of Greece to Hampden Park next month is hugely significant.\nThe stodginess of Scotland’s display before Ché Adams nudged them in front against Belarus ultimately proved irrelevant. Belarus lacked the nous and guile to inflict a bloody nose on Scotland. Still, recent struggles against packed defences meant nobody of Scottish persuasion could rest entirely easy until a 65th-minute own goal was added to the Adams effort. Greek success and a comfortable one in Glasgow in March serves as a warning. Still, the Scots would have readily taken this position and opportunity before a Group C ball was kicked. Back-to-back clean sheets to start the campaign bodes well. This looks like a robust, well-drilled team once again.\n“It is a good start but it is only a start,” said the Scotland manager Steve Clarke. “Four points will never qualify anybody for anything. It is nice to go home with smiles on our faces but I am already thinking about next month.”\nScotland’s showing during the scoreless draw in Copenhagen on Friday, coupled with Belarus’s 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Greece, placed the Tartan Army in that historically dangerous position of holding great expectation. Deepest Hungary and a closed doors scenario conjured memories of Covid times, during which Scotland qualified for their first tournament since 1998. The wait for a World Cup appearance, though, stretches back to that very year.\nIn accordance with the variation in task, Clarke freshened up his team. Ben Gannon-Doak was one of four changes to the Scottish starting XI as Clarke sought increased cutting edge. Belarus switched eight as they sought to improve on a record of just three wins in 28 World Cup qualifiers.\nThe first quarter of the game was so hectic as to belie the lack of atmosphere. Gannon-Doak in combination with Andy Robertson carried Scotland’s main threat on the left side.\nThe Scotland manager looked rightly irritated, however, that his team was not creating clearcut opportunities. Max Johnston broke that mould with a cross poked wide by Scott McTominay in the 29th minute. McTominay soon screamed in vain for a penalty; Yegor Parkhomenko’s unpunished challenge occurred outside the box in any case.\nAngus Gunn spared his Scotland teammates red faces before the interval. Johnston, whose defensive attributes are open to question, simply stopped in allowing Max Ebong to maraud through on goal. Gunn saved with his feet at his near post from the Astana man. The Scots heeded the warning. Billy Gilmour responded with a long-range attempt that Fedor Lapoukhov fumbled on to the woodwork. A terrific John McGinn cross found the head of McTominay, who placed the ball on a plate for Adams. The 29-year-old notched his 10th Scotland goal from all of three yards. Two minutes before the break, Scotland had their crucial advantage.\nScotland’s task should have been simplified six minutes after the restart. Instead – and incredibly – the referee issued only a yellow card to Vladislav Kalinin for a wild lunge on Lewis Ferguson. Equally incomprehensible was the failure of the video assistant referee to at least send Nikola Dabanovic towards a monitor. Even before modern day sanitisation of tackling, this was a sending-off offence. McTominay should have diminished the significance of the incident but sent a free header straight into Lapoukhov’s hands from 12 yards.\nJust when it seemed the biggest threat to Scotland was their own impatience, their lead was doubled. This was the strangest of things, a fine team goal converted by an opponent. Robertson fed Gilmour, who played inside to Adams. Gilmour’s run in breaking from midfield was perfectly timed, allowing Adams to complete the one-two. Gilmour’s headed cross was bound for the head of McTominay, causing Zakhar Volkov to panic and nod beyond his own goalkeeper. Scotland had the leeway they craved and a two-goal margin the increasingly blunt Belarus side looked incapable of overhauling. Attention now turned towards Athens, where Denmark were swaggering to a surprising win.\nAdams should have claimed his second but delayed his angled shot, allowing Pavel Zabelin to clear from the goalline. A raft of substitutions had removed what little tempo there was in the fixture. Clarke had no reason to care about that. Hampden on 9 October should be quite the spectacle. Another win would send Scotland halfway towards their promised land.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Craig Bellamy compared Premier League players to “cyborgs” as he discussed the growing physicality in the game after Thomas Tuchel said long throws and direct tactics were in vogue.\nThe Wales manager said he handpicked friendlies against Canada on Tuesday and England next month – two higher-ranked nations – to provide a barometer of his team’s progress and believes facing the latter at Wembley will be the perfect warm-up for hosting Belgium in a crunch World Cup qualifier four days later.\nTuchel said long throws were “back” and that England must consider adding long balls to their attacking weaponry. Bellamy, who was assistant manager to Vincent Kompany in the top flight at Burnley, was asked whether he had detected a recent shift in styles.\nBellamy said: “I think the physicality is clear and it has been for a few years … It has become a running game. It has become beyond extreme with the physical capabilities. We found it with Burnley – we built a Championship team that could come out of small spaces. Then go to the Premier League: cyborgs, that’s what you’re up against. It was unreal. They just run you but also have ridiculous ability … that’s why you pay £80m for that type of profile. Then you look around the team and see £40m, £50m, £60m [players].”\nWales host Canada, coached by the former Leeds manager Jesse Marsch, in Swansea. Bellamy said of selecting challenging opposition: “I was like: ‘Give me the toughest.’ Look, I’m fully aware I could get beaten and – can I say this? – get my ass kicked but what would I gain from playing a lesser team, where we know where we are? This is a tough game. We’ll see where we are. It gives us a good opportunity to be able to get better.”\nBellamy hopes the Canada match, the first men’s home game to be held in Swansea since November 2020 and outside Cardiff since July 2023, will be a sell-out. “I believe national teams, countries like us, should be playing in front of full stadiums,” he said. “I might be pushing it, but I expect that.”\nBellamy was informed that as of Monday afternoon the Football Association of Wales had sold about 15,000 tickets. “So, we push again,” he said with a smile. “It’s not a meaningless friendly, [it is an] important game.”"

    "raw_text": "For Wales, Thursday’s World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan presents challenges aplenty. In between preparing to play on an artificial surface at the Astana Arena, there is a balance between maximising precious time on the pitches and prioritising recovery. Wales took an eight-hour direct flight from Cardiff to Astana, avoiding Ukrainian airspace, and their only real training session as a full squad will be 24 hours before kick-off. Player body clocks will be programmed to a two-hour – not four-hour – time difference.\nOne Wales supporter, John McAllister, spied a challenge in the fixture. His odyssey, inspired by the BBC’s Race Across the World, began five weeks ago when he left home in Barry, south Wales. Since 29 July he has been travelling from Cymru to Kazakhstan, the world’s ninth-largest country by land area and the largest to be landlocked, documenting his journey in a series of YouTube videos. The 26-year-old has covered about 5,000km. More than 1,100 Wales fans will be at the game but only one, understandably, has been directly referenced by Craig Bellamy. “We’ve got to see him, because it means so much to us,” the Wales manager said.\nMcAllister, who regularly follows Wales away, admits this is about as far-flung as it gets. Thursday’s match will be his 12th of the trip. He highlights Fenerbahce’s Champions League date with Feyenoord in Istanbul as his favourite owing to the supercharged atmosphere. He paid a fixer to source a ticket and soon found himself immersed with the locals in a park over the road from the stadium. “Three hours before kick-off, there’s crazy pyrotechnics going off,” he says. Belgrade brought three appetising games, while the £1.35 entry to a second-tier game in Almaty, close to the Chinese border and farther east than Islamabad and Mumbai, also warrants a mention. “I’ll watch anything … my bread and butter is going to Barry Town in the Cymru Premier League.”\nMcAllister ticked off France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands – and England – on his first day. Then he travelled across the Balkans and signed up to a 36-hour train across Turkey into Georgia. Wearing a Cymru T-shirt in a Tbilisi bar, shortly after photographing the Mother of Georgia monument, he felt an air of familiarity. “A fella taps me on the shoulder and says: ‘Shwmae, are you from Wales?’” McAllister says, recalling how he was suddenly talking to a man from Rhoose, a village located few miles from Barry. “It was crazy. He said: ‘I live out here and I’m going out on a stag do tonight. Do you fancy joining us, if you’re on your own?’ So I went on this Irish fella’s stag with 30 strangers.”\nChacha, a Georgian brandy, went down a treat, and things went so swimmingly McAllister bagged an invitation to the wedding – only it was the same day he was flying to Atyrau, northwest Kazakhstan. “Through gritted teeth and a lack of alternatives,” he says, given, ideally, he wanted to avoid air travel unless absolutely necessary. But the options were limited with Russia in effect out of bounds and travel through Iran requiring a government-approved guide at all times. The land border into Azerbaijan is closed, so crossing the Caspian Sea via Baku was also not an option. “Getting the passport stamp, actually realising I was in Kazakhstan, was pretty cool,” McAllister says.\nFor Wales, second in Group J at the halfway stage of qualifying, Kazakhstan represents their sole competitive match this window; Wales host Canada in Swansea for a friendly next Tuesday. Last week Bellamy highlighted how “athletic and stubborn” Kazakhstan, 83 places below his side in the Fifa rankings, possess more players in the Champions League clubs than in his squad, owing to Kairat Almaty’s progress against Celtic.\nMcAllister attended the second leg in Almaty. “We’re in a kind of can’t-drop-points situation because we’re going to have to go toe-to-toe with Belgium to qualify automatically. But we really seem to have moved forward with our style of play – the near-miss comeback against Belgium proved how far we’ve come. Things have been very promising under Bellamy.”\nNow after journeying east, taking in 17 trains, 11 buses, four time zones and plenty of beer, the rest of the Red Wall is on the horizon. “They are all flooding into the city,” says McAllister, who has seen Christmas trees in the main square in Erzurum, a Turkish city close to the Armenian border covered in snow for six months of the year, experienced an impromptu heavy-metal night on arrival in Kazakhstan and explored Vukovar, a Croatian city “on those dark tourism lists” after it was sieged by Yugoslavia in 1991.\nThose sceptical of his master plan at the outset are now in awe. “I think the unanimous answer at the beginning was: you’re crazy,” McAllister says. “But since I said this was what I was doing and I’ve posted updates along the way, people have been fantastic. Everyone’s been very supportive and sent lots of encouragement. It’s been very good fun.”"

    "raw_text": "Thomas Tuchel is prepared to use long throws and high balls from the back in his pursuit of World Cup glory. The England manager, whose team face Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday in their toughest assignment of qualification, talked last week of wanting to streamline and simplify his approach. Tuchel is coming to terms with the realities of international football and the limited amount of time he has with the players. He has worked to instil short-passing patterns but, as he reflected on how some old‑fashioned qualities were making a comeback, he declared being open to adding a more unreconstructed dimension.\nEngland got both of their goals from lofted crosses on Saturday in the 2-0 victory against Andorra at Villa Park. The first cross was delivered from an inside-right position by Noni Madueke and led to an own goal from Christian Garcia. The second was from a much wider position on the same flank. It was sent over by Reece James and headed home by Declan Rice.\n“The last one was more classic than the first one,” Tuchel said. “The last one was from the sideline, with the right foot to the second post and our No 10 arrived – Declan. I tell you the long throw-in is back, as well.\n“Once we arrive at the World Cup, all these things matter so we will also talk about long throw-ins, we will talk about long kicks from the goalkeeper and not only playing short. We cannot put everything into four days of training but these things will matter. Let’s see. I need to reflect with my assistant coaches. All these patterns are back and crosses are back, as well.”\nTuchel anticipates a heated atmosphere against Serbia at the Rajko Mitic Stadium and said his players must be prepared for anything and everything – including a dodgy pitch and sending-offs. “We will have to adapt to the adversity and overcome adversity and let’s see what the pitch is like … how the game plays out,” Tuchel said.\n“You never know. You can have red cards, yellow cards, whatever. We need to be ready for everything. We will face the same formation as against Andorra – the defensive block of 5-4-1 with individual quality up front with tall physical strikers.”\nTuchel was asked specifically about the playing surface. Had it been flagged as a possible concern? “Not yet,” he said with a knowing smile. “We expect … we are ready for everything. We feel that we are ready to step up to the atmosphere, the physicality, and it will be an emotional, very important game in the group.\n“The main thing is that I trust the players because I felt them very strong this week. We’ve had an excellent camp. I felt the energy right, the attitude right, and that’s why I have full trust that we will have a good game in Serbia. We will prove ourselves to be ready to win there.”\nTuchel’s players have been warned by the Football Association to be aware of hostility from the stands that crosses a line and also the reactive protocols open to them, which include walking off the pitch. In 2012, England’s black players were subjected to racist abuse in an under-21s game in Serbia, and last year Serbia were hit with partial ground closures by Uefa over supporter behaviour in the Nations League.\nThe stadium will again be partially closed on Tuesday, this time on Fifa orders after racist behaviour by some Serbia fans during the 3-0 home win against Andorra in June. At least 15% of the capacity behind the goals will be empty. Since 2021, the Serbia Football Federation has been fined €703,375 for offences of their fans, including acts of discrimination.\n“I’d say we’re very aware of maybe some of the challenges that we may face out there,” the midfielder Eberechi Eze said. “It’s something that internally we’ll decide and have conversations about.”\nThe Serbian federation has reiterated a plea for good behaviour. “Because we are under Uefa and Fifa scrutiny and because of the history of various incidents that have made us the subject of disciplinary measures, we appeal to supporters to send out an image to the world that will make us all proud,” it said in a statement\nTuchel has a potential selection issue in central defence after Marc Guéhi reported discomfort in his groin at half-time against Andorra. The Crystal Palace captain carried on until the 76th minute before he was replaced with Aston Villa’s Ezri Konsa, the fourth substitution of the permitted five. Tuchel said he wanted to introduce another Villa player, Ollie Watkins, for Harry Kane up front but the Guéhi situation altered his thinking. Kane stayed on for 90 minutes.\n“I wanted to put Ollie on as it’s Villa Park and for sure his family was there. I was a bit unhappy with that,” Tuchel said. “We lost already John Stones [who withdrew from the squad with an injury] and I was not ready to take the risk. Ezri is also a Villa player so we had that. It turned out that Harry stayed on; it’s never a problem. He will be ready for Tuesday.”"

    "raw_text": "Harry Kane has played before at the Red Star Stadium in Belgrade. It was with his former club Tottenham in 2019 and it is for good reason that the England captain lists it among his top three most intimidating away venues. The others, for the record, are Marseille’s Vélodrome and Galatasaray’s Rams Park.\nKane went to the former with Spurs in 2022 and it did not matter that the Virage Nord was closed after incidents involving the Marseille support. He sampled the ear-splitting whistles of the latter with his current club, Bayern Munich, in 2023. Red Star’s ground is called the Rajko Mitic Stadium these days but the basic malevolence has not changed.\n“It’s just the walk from the changing room to the pitch – it feels like a mile long,” Kane said. “There’s a lot of fans, you hear a lot of noise, a lot of banging. So, yeah, it was pretty hostile.”\nKane returns with England for the World Cup qualifier against Serbia on Tuesday night and it promises to be a frenzied occasion, even if almost 15% of the stadium will be empty on Fifa orders. The governing body has doled out the punishment after the discriminatory behaviour of Serbia’s fans against Andorra in June.\nThe pressure will come not only from the hardliners in the home seats but from those in the visiting enclosure and many more on sofas up and down England. Because this is a tie that has the trappings of a moment of truth.\nIt will be incumbent on Kane to lead from the front, helping the less experienced players around him. Dan Burn, Myles Lewis‑Skelly, Elliot Anderson and Noni Madueke have no reference points for a crunch England fixture. It is certainly a blow that injuries have ruled out John Stones, Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, among others. Above all, though, it is Thomas Tuchel who will feel the burn.\nIt is only camp No 3 for the manager but, as he is acutely aware, the time is tight and, thus far, it has all been pretty underwhelming. The wins have come, apart from in the friendly defeat by Senegal at the City Ground – it has been four out of four in qualification Group K, with no goals conceded. Yet there is a sense of Tuchel feeling various pennies drop; of him groping for the answers.\nBefore the 2-0 victory against Andorra at Villa Park on Saturday, Tuchel talked about trying to simplify his approach and messaging to the players. Perhaps this is not a job for a detail freak. Tuchel, of course, is a detail freak. Afterwards he suggested he may be open to becoming even more unreconstructed further down the line, using long throws and high balls up from the back. Is this him?\nTuchel wanted to try Stones in the No 6 role against Serbia, which would have been interesting. What it also showed is how he worries that he does not have a specialist for the position. Tuchel does not want Kane to drop too deep from the No 9 spot. Yet when he did not on Saturday, he had only 12 touches. The goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, had 24. What of Marcus Rashford on the left wing? Tuchel has shown incredible trust in him. It has not yet been repaid.\nThere is the theory that Tuchel has been in a no-win situation in his opening qualifiers, especially the two against Andorra, which followed those against Albania and Latvia at Wembley. Low block tedium, no spaces to impress; victories simply presumed. Kane appeared to warm to the theme. “Look at the other day,” he said. “You win 2-0, it’s not enough. You win 5-0, it’s only Andorra. It’s almost a lose-lose.”\nSo, by extension, is it not a good thing to have a proper game with actual jeopardy? If there is the possibility of a bad result, there is something to be gained from getting a good one. The fear is that defeat could bring the knives out for Tuchel from those supporters who, frankly, had made up their minds about him before he had taken charge of his first game. Kane wanted to push the upside.\n“When you go to tough environments, you sometimes come away, especially when you win, with an even better feeling,” he said. “When you get through these types of games together, especially as a newish team like we are, that’s how you build experiences and togetherness.\n“There might be times when we have to stick together, defend as a team and, ultimately, find a way to win. When you are able to do that against these types of oppositions in these stadiums, I feel like that builds an extra layer of togetherness that you can’t form without playing.\n“So far [under Tuchel], we’ve had a lot of games where we’ve played against low blocks, where we’ve had a lot of possession and have almost played against ourselves in a way. The teams we’ve faced are almost happy to lose 1-0 or 2-0, whereas tomorrow night is going to be completely different. Hopefully, we can show the best version of ourselves – with and without the ball.”\nKane might have liked to make one final point about Belgrade, Marseille and Istanbul, his unholy trinity, although he left it unsaid. His Spurs team won 4-0 and 2-1 at Red Star and Marseille respectively, while Bayern beat Galatasaray 3-1. Kane loves these battles. Once more unto the breach."

    "raw_text": "Son Heung-min’s anguish at Everton on Sunday knew no bounds and it is no exaggeration to say that on Monday, as the guilt at his role in André Gomes’s horrific injury continued to consume him, the Tottenham forward could not even think about this Champions League test against Red Star Belgrade.\nMauricio Pochettino and the Spurs dressing room closed ranks around him. They told him that in no logical world should his trip have led to such damage to Gomes’s ankle and they believed that the best medicine for Son was to get straight back into the saddle. There was no point in moping.\nOn a night when Spurs registered their first away win of the season, it was Son who provided the cutting edge. His sixth and seventh goals of the season in the second half allowed his team to coast to a victory that has put the last 16 of the competition within touching distance. For them, the equation is simple. If they can beat Olympiakos at home in three weeks’ time they will reach the knockout rounds for the third season in succession.\nSpurs could temporarily forget their domestic woes as, not for the first time, the Champions League provided a tonic. Giovani Lo Celso, on his full debut for Spurs, scored the first goal, a moment that embellished a performance of no little slickness, and Christian Eriksen, who entered as a substitute, added a late fourth.\nPochettino could enjoy productivity from all three of his summer signings. Never mind Lo Celso, Tanguy Ndombele was excellent and even Ryan Sessegnon, who came off the bench, supplied the assist for Eriksen.\n| Pos | Team | P | GD | Pts |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Bayern Munich | 4 | 11 | 12 |\n| 2 | Tottenham Hotspur | 4 | 4 | 7 |\n| 3 | Red Star Belgrade | 4 | -10 | 3 |\n| 4 | Olympiacos | 4 | -5 | 1 |\nRed Star rued the squandering of two excellent first-half chances but Spurs simply had more quality. They hogged the ball, they led the shot count 17-5 and, at the end, there was the sight of Son and Pochettino offering their thanks to the travelling support.\nSon’s goal celebrations were subdued. The first was a praying gesture and he revealed that it was his way of showing respect to Gomes. “I didn’t want to celebrate because I just want to respect the situation,” he said. “It’s been a really, really tough few days. I’m really sorry for the accident but I had to focus for the team. I want to wish André Gomes to get well soon.”\nSpurs had travelled in the belief that Red Star on home turf would be a different proposition to the team that had slumped to a 5-0 defeat in north London two weeks ago. The statistics offered the warning. In 21 previous European home ties, Red Star had lost only two while exactly a year ago they had beaten Liverpool 2-0. Yet after a cagey opening, in which Milan Pavkov blew a gilt-edged one-on-one with Paulo Gazzaniga, shooting too close to the goalkeeper, Spurs asserted themselves.\nPochettino had shuffled his pack, starting Juan Foyth at right-back and Eric Dier in central defence, but Lo Celso was the headline news item. The loanee from Real Betis, whom Spurs have the option to buy for £55m next summer, had previously played only 74 minutes for Spurs. He was in action until 6 July at the Copa América with Argentina and did not sign until 8 August – transfer deadline day in England – having missed pre-season entirely.\nLo Celso’s time at Spurs has been characterised by fitness struggles and mutterings from Pochettino that he has been some way off the pace. Here, it was possible to see what he will bring to the team. Playing on the right of midfield, he showed off his change of pace and an eagerness to pass the ball with zip and directness.\nLo Celso began the move which led to the breakthrough goal, pouncing on Dusan Jovancic to win possession and release Harry Kane, although a good deal would happen before he jabbed his shot past Milan Borjan.\nKane’s first touch looked heavy but he got to the ball before Borjan to poke a shot against the foot of a post. When Son’s follow-up attempt was hacked off the line, it appeared that the danger had passed. Yet Ndombele recycled the move, crossing for Kane, who flashed a volley across the face of goal. Son stretched to divert the ball up and against the crossbar and, after a further scramble, Lo Celso took a touch and prodded home.\nRed Star might have feared it would not be their night when they also hit the frame of the goal twice in the same move on 44 minutes, only this time there would be no finish. Rajiv van La Parra rattled the foot of the near post and, when Davinson Sánchez accidentally looped the rebound towards his own goal, it came back off the crossbar.\nRed Star’s end product was missing. Witness Pavkov’s decision to pass rather than shoot when well-placed early in the second half – he got it all wrong – and Spurs turned the screw thereafter.\nThere is a swashbuckling quality to Ndombele and he drove hard into the final third before whipping the ball over to Dele Alli, who played in Son with a perfectly weighted assist. Son thrashed the ball past Borjan before he added his second shortly afterwards. It was another nicely worked team effort.\nKane got Danny Rose in behind the Red Star defence and the full-back’s low cross invited Son to tap home.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Cristian Stellini was on the pitch, screaming at Harry Kane to release the through ball and, for a brief moment, it looked as though the Tottenham assistant manager, in charge of the team as the suspended Antonio Conte watched from the stands, was going to play it himself.\nIt was the final minute of stoppage time, nerve ends were frayed – actually, they were past that – and, when Kane delayed, Stellini spun on his heels and threw his hands into the air. Spurs were plainly determined to eke things out even further, to put everybody through the wringer; the theme of a wild and intense night.\nBut Kane knew what he was doing. Now he played the pass and there was Pierre-Emile Højbjerg streaking clear. How he kept his composure, the finish flashing in off the far post and Spurs were not just through to the Champions League last 16, they were through as the group winners, leapfrogging Eintracht Frankfurt at the last.\nTottenham had done the thing they have done too readily of late and failed to show up in the first half. When they trailed at the break to Chancel Mbemba’s header, it was the least that Marseille deserved. The French club were in line for a first qualification to the knockout rounds of this competition since 2011-12.\nIt had been billed as a psychological test for Spurs; the din inside this cauldron was relentless. It turned into something even more in the second half. Staring at elimination, Spurs had to dig into the depths of their resolve, to show their personality. During a second half that will live long in the memories of the travelling fans, they did so. It was Clément Lenglet who found the precious equaliser, the goal that stood to carry them through as runners-up, a header from Ivan Perisic’s whipped free-kick and they had the chances to have made life much easier for themselves.\nKane had a few while Højbjerg rattled the crossbar when he ought to have scored. It was a dominant second period from Spurs when they most needed it but there were still a couple of wobbles as the end approached. This is Spurs. There had to be.\nThe script was there for a player with Arsenal connections to sink them because there were four in Marseille colours. Alexis Sánchez bought a yard inside the area only to see Perisic block and then, in the 88th minute, Sead Kolasinac, who had entered as a substitute, swooped at the far post to meet a free header. To wails all around, he planted it past the post.\nWhat a test it was for Conte, partly of his temperament because he would have hated being stuck in the stands after his red card against Sporting last week. He was bold with his starting lineup, picking the one that most supporters would have wanted – no Emerson Royal or Davinson Sánchez, both Ivan Perisic and Ryan Sessegnon, an extra attacker in Lucas Moura rather than an extra midfielder. But it all seemed to be going wrong.\nConte would switch to 3-5-2 in the 29th minute when Son Heung-min was forced off after Mbemba caught him across the face with a shoulder as he stepped up to contest a header. Son was scrambled. It looked a bad one. On came Yves Bissouma at the base of a three-man midfield.\nUp to that point, Spurs had failed to connect their passing game. There were precious few options for the player on the ball and it only got worse for them before the interval. In truth, the formation looked more like 5-3-2, the wing-backs deep. Everyone was deep, inviting Marseille on. Spurs appeared nervous.\nIgor Tudor’s team squeezed high, they won the duels and the breakthrough had been signposted. Sánchez glanced an early header past the far post and Hugo Lloris needed to save smartly from a Jordan Veretout blast on 34 minutes following a Sessegnon mis-kick.\nMbemba’s goal came after Sessegnon shepherded the ball over the line for a corner, wrongly believing that the last touch had been off a Marseille player. When the ball was played short to Veretout, he crossed deep and nobody picked Mbemba’s run. Up in the press box, a bloke picked up a TV and whirled it above his head.\nThe only thing that Spurs could point to before half-time was a Kane shot in stoppage-time that Pau López tipped over (it looked to be going high). When the corner was half-cleared, Højbjerg lashed wide.\nYet Spurs were transformed upon the second-half restart, playing with greater intensity and the elixir of belief. They began to look forwards, not sideways, with Rodrigo Bentancur excelling in midfield, driving with the ball; ditto Højbjerg. Kane was also fundamental to the turn-around, linking the play and getting into dangerous areas.\nConte betrayed little emotion when Lenglet scored, although his insides churned. Belatedly, there was freedom to Spurs’ game and as Marseille pushed – Amine Harit flashed one shot high – the visitors threatened to pick them off. Kane’s big chance came on 64 minutes but he could not react after López spilled a Royal cross. Royal made a difference after coming on for the out-of-sorts Sessegnon.\nSpurs were on their way. In the small hours of Tuesday, Marseille Ultras had set off fireworks above their team hotel, trying to throw them off balance. They would find their stride and in pulsating fashion.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Thomas Tuchel wanted smiles. He wanted a response after the lacklustre performance against Andorra in Barcelona on Saturday, albeit in a 1-0 World Cup qualifying win. What he got was another line to his brow, plenty to ponder as he begins what could be a long summer debrief. And more boos.\nThere was a bit of zip and personality from Tuchel’s team in the final 25 minutes of regulation time. He made attacking changes, with the Nottingham Forest midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White – on his home ground – showing up. Eberechi Eze, who played from the start, was good. Morgan Rogers came on up front for Harry Kane, who had given England an early lead, and there was some pace and energy.\nThe problem was that Senegal were 2-1 up by then, having played around and through England far too easily. They were much the better team in the first half, Ismaïla Sarr’s equaliser scant reward for their efforts. The faultlines were pronounced for England at the back; it was a particularly uncomfortable evening for the full-backs, Kyle Walker and Myles Lewis-Skelly. The buildups from the back were tough to watch. There was an overall timidity.\nEngland looked as though they might escape with a draw in this friendly when Jude Bellingham, who came off the bench, took a touch on his thigh before lashing home in the 83rd minute after Levi Colwill had smuggled a corner towards him. That would be scrubbed out when the video assistant referee spotted the ball had come off Colwill’s upper arm.\nTuchel went for broke, introducing Ivan Toney for Lewis-Skelly and switching to three at the back. But Senegal had continued to advertise their threat on the counter and with England now leaving the back door open, they stormed through it in stoppage time. Curtis Jones, another replacement, was dispossessed by Idrissa Gueye and Lamine Camara’s pass was weighted for the substitute Cheikh Sabaly to sweep home.\nIt was the prompt for thousands of home supporters to stream for the exits, the full-time whistle bringing jeers from those that stayed. “Disgraceful,” bellowed one fan close to the press box. Never before have England lost to an African nation. Has Tuchel had a honeymoon period? It is hard to say, given the opposition in some quarters to his appointment. If he has, it is 100% over.\nTuchel wanted Senegal to come and play. No 5-4-1 Andorra-style low block, bus parked, handbrake on. He expects his England team to raise their level significantly against the better opponents. Which for long spells, did not happen.\nSenegal played. There was a moment early on when the quicksilver Iliman Ndiaye streaked away from Lewis-Skelly up the right before tricking inside Conor Gallagher and playing in Nicolas Jackson with a reverse pass. It was a clear chance for Jackson, who blasted too close to Dean Henderson. The tone was set.\nCan a visiting team start too well? Camara was certainly emboldened to try a fancy spin on the edge of his own defensive third and when he was robbed by Eze, who played as a No 10-cum-second striker, Senegal were stretched. Eze went left to Gallagher, who went left again for Anthony Gordon, who shot low. Édouard Mendy made a hash of the save. Kane was alive to the rebound.\nIt was a weird first-half performance from England. They were static and predictable when they attempted to play out. Where were the options? Tuchel wants time to instil them. He does not have it. England played with fire as Senegal brought the press. Tuchel’s men made errors on the ball. They went down, at times, desperately appealing for fouls. It was tough to watch.\nKane made a few nice moves as he dropped back and tried to ignite his team while Gordon blew a golden chance on 29 minutes, dragging wide of an empty net at the far post from a low Walker cross.\nSenegal were more cohesive and dynamic, and they deserved the equaliser, swept home by Sarr after he was sharper to react than Walker to Jackson’s hooked cross from the right. Sarr made up three yards on Walker, which really should not have happened, while Jackson had run away from Trevoh Chalobah, a debutant, on to a ball over the top. Senegal had other flickers in the first half. Sarr was left alone to work Henderson with a header and Gueye did likewise when he shot through a crowd.\nTuchel had demanded energy, exuberance. It was Senegal who continued to bring it after the restart. There was a reason why Tuchel introduced Gibbs-White just before the hour. The crowd needed a lift. So did England. By then, Senegal might have been ahead, Habib Diarra lifting high following an El Hadji Malick Diouf cross.\nIt was no surprise when Senegal took the lead. Lewis-Skelly was caught out by Kalidou Koulibaly’s ball up the inside right channel and Diarra was away, England wide open. The finish was steered through Henderson’s legs.\nGibbs-White was positive while Eze came alive as England tried to respond. There was an outrageous touch and layoff from the latter for Gibbs-White, who drilled too close to Mendy. The pair also combined to tee up Bukayo Saka; his shot was brilliantly saved by the goalkeeper. For a moment, it appeared that Bellingham would be England’s saviour. Instead, Sabaly twisted the knife.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "It was nothing more than a contractual obligation fulfilled. There was little to see here at Villa Park. Or get excited about. England beat Andorra, as they always do. They did not concede against them, as always. And Thomas Tuchel’s record in World Cup qualifying Group K now shows the maximum number of points from four ties – and four clean sheets.\nThe manager had talked about bringing greater aggression; more speed and penetration, helped by a cleaner and simpler approach. But it was not a game that demanded intense analysis. Rather it was one to tick off and move on from.\nIt was better than the away fixture against Andorra, which was played in Barcelona in June, when England grubbed home by the only goal after a flat performance, hearing boos at half-time and full-time. But long before this one was over, the thoughts of most supporters had begun to turn to the tie against Serbia in Belgrade on Tuesday. That promises to be hostile; the acid test of qualification.\nTuchel had likened the challenge of getting through Andorra’s low block to chewing gum. In other words, deeply monotonous, something to make your face muscles ache. Noni Madueke forced an own goal from the Andorra defender, Christian García, midway through the first half and Declan Rice made it 2-0 midway through the second.\nThe statistics showed that Andorra touched the ball four times inside the England area. The number was five in June. It was attack versus defence throughout, almost like a training session. The international break for England was always going to be all about Serbia.\nTuchel had sought to set the tone by going with his strongest possible lineup, one that featured players in their very best positions as he sees it, although there were exceptions. The manager had suggested Dan Burn and Marc Guéhi were in competition at left centre-half. He started both, Guéhi preferred to Ezri Konsa in the right-sided role. Rice and Elliot Anderson are the No 8s in the squad. Tuchel put them both in, too, giving the latter his debut as the No 6.\nIn possession, England were more 4-3-3 than 4-2-3-1, Eberechi Eze in a right-sided No 8 position, Rice to his left. No prizes for guessing how Andorra set up – in a resolute 5-4-1. Tuchel had actually described them on Friday as using a 5-5-0 system.\nHow do the people of Andorra live these ties? Do they even watch? Because there is literally nothing from their team; zero adventure. They have been managed by the same manager, Koldo Álvarez, for the last 15 years. He does what he does. They do what they do. Then again, this is a nation of 82,000 – roughly the same population as Ashford in Kent.\nEngland needed a goal before the half hour mark, the point at which it was possible to wonder whether the crowd might grow frustrated. They got it. Anderson was lively, looking to progress the ball and he sparked a move that got Madueke into a crossing position. The right winger floated it over towards Rice, who had made a late run for the six-yard box, and it came off the head of García to nestle inside the far corner.\nTuchel watched, at times, from a seated position on top of a Lucozade drinks cooler. Where was the energy, Thomas! But he celebrated the breakthrough with aggressively clenched fists. Relief was a part of it.\nMadueke has Bukayo Saka for competition; Saka is among the posse of injured players to miss this window. And Madueke was game, direct; he tried to make things happen. He had teed up Eze for a shot in the 15th minute, which ended up too close to the goalkeeper, Iker Álvarez. Eze saw another one cleared off the line on 23 minutes by Max Llovera after a cut-back from Rice.\nIt was thin gruel in the first half, England not sharp enough. The tempo was missing. It was sideways stuff, too often. At least they were not booed off by the sell-out crowd. The fans’ commitment was hugely impressive. It always is.\nEngland pushed after the restart and they looked more creative. Eze worked the goalkeeper after a Madueke burst while Marcus Rashford bent the follow-up wide. Anderson went close after Harry Kane had helped to force a turnover high up, a potential moment to cherish denied by Álvarez’s diving save. Eze lashed high when well placed but the offside flag had gone up – it was not his day – before Rice scored the second with a downwards header from Reece James’s cross.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Manchester City and the Premier League have settled their dispute over rules that limit the ability of top-flight clubs to sign sponsorship deals with companies related to their ownership.\nThe fight over so-called associated party transaction rules had been seen as a potential challenge to the entire Premier League rulebook, but both parties have now stepped back from the brink, with City agreeing to accept the legitimacy of the APT rules as they stand.\n“The Premier League and Manchester City FC have reached a settlement in relation to the arbitration commenced by the club earlier this year concerning the Premier League’s associated party transaction (APT) rules, and as a result have agreed to terminate the proceedings,” the parties said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon.\n“This settlement brings an end to the dispute between the parties regarding the APT rules. As part of the settlement Manchester City accepts that the current APT rules are valid and binding. It has been agreed that neither the Premier League nor the club will be making any further comment about the matter.”\nCity claimed victory in an initial battle over APT in October, after an arbitration panel found that certain aspects of the rules which then stood were discriminatory. Loans made by shareholders to their own club should have been included within APT rules, the panel adjudged, while there were also problems with the way in which clubs were given information on what might be “fair market value” in any given deal.\nAfter making adjustments to accommodate the panel’s ruling, the Premier League argued that any problems over APT had been resolved and its rulebook fit for purpose. City challenged the league’s adjustments, however, and began a new process of arbitration this year. It is this second process which has now been resolved. Both parties, however, remain involved in the lengthy and secretive disciplinary process in which the club have been hit with more than 130 charges of breaking the Premier League’s rulebook."

    "raw_text": "Manchester City have claimed success in their fight against the Premier League and its rules over associated party transactions (APT).\nIt is a claim disputed by the Premier League, and the verdict laid down by a panel of judges at an arbitration tribunal appeared to confirm the necessity of APT rules and the Premier League’s right to enforce them. Such a divergence in interpretation between the league and its champions suggests any hopes the verdict might restore calm to the competition and its off-field troubles are likely to be unfulfilled.\n“The Club has succeeded with its claim: the Associated Party Transaction rules have been found to be unlawful and the Premier League’s decisions on two specific MCFC sponsorship transactions have been set aside,” City said in a statement.\nThe unlawful aspects, as determined by the tribunal, relate to the exclusion of shareholder loans from APT rules and the process by which clubs were informed of “benchmarking” decisions when assessing fair market value.\nThese two subsidiary aspects of the regulations will have to change. City have also had APT sponsorship deals with Etihad and First Abu Dhabi Bank, rejected during the past year over a failure to achieve fair market value, set aside meaning they have a chance to be considered again under reformed rules.\nThe clearest victory for City came in the challenge to rules on loans made by shareholders to their clubs. Despite Uefa having regulations that require such loans to meet fair market value – ie that the loans be made at or close to market rates – the Premier League exempted such deals when the rules were redrafted this year.\nThe league argued the exemption was not discriminatory because any club could undertake such an activity. City argued that such loans, which could be made either at no or low interest, were discriminatory and distortive. The arbitration panel agreed with City. The rules distort competition, the panel argued, because “they permit one form of subsidy … but not another”.\nThe second victory for City related to a complaint that the league had not shared relevant benchmarking information at an appropriate point, denying the club the opportunity to feed back before a decision was made. This was upheld by the tribunal and will necessitate another rule change.\nThe Premier League argued it was the party to have emerged successfully from the process because the ruling “upheld the need for the APT system as a whole and rejected the majority of Manchester City’s challenges”. The league said it planned to “quickly and effectively” adjust its rulebook in discussion with its shareholder clubs.\nInformation revealed as part of the verdict showed the case had split opinion throughout the cohort of Premier League clubs.\nEverton, Newcastle and Chelsea were revealed to have given witness statements in support of City’s claim, while Liverpool, Manchester United, West Ham, Arsenal and Brighton made submissions in support of the league. The verdict ends a process which began this year after the league revised its rules over APTs. It has no direct connection to the legal process which has seen the league charge City with 130 breaches of its rules. City have denied wrongdoing and lawyers began hearing that case on 16 September, with a verdict expected in the new year.\nAPTs, in which clubs strike sponsorship or revenue deals with businesses linked to their owners, have been the subject of scrutiny from the league for some time.\nIn February clubs voted to approve tougher rules regarding how such deals are valued. A requirement to assess fair market value for APTs was challenged by City, who have argued it contravenes competition law.\nCity are understood to have asked for financial damages from the league for perceived losses from sponsorship deals that were halted by the rules. They argue that the league has not been able to prove that clubs get an unfair advantage from APTs and that it has previously failed to act with the same urgency to control big spending by dominant sides.\nThe takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund in 2021 had previously prompted hurried attempts by clubs to change APT rules.\nCity also allege the rules were designed to stymie owners from Gulf states – a claim rejected by the tribunal – and members of multi-club ownership groups and were established only because of the desire of rivals to “safeguard their own commercial advantages”."

    "raw_text": "Manchester City have initiated new legal action against the Premier League, as the champions challenge rules on associated party transactions (APT) for a second time.\nThe news comes as the two parties remain in dispute over an initial challenge to rules that control how much money can be generated through sponsorship from companies with connections to a club’s ownership.\nCity are also awaiting a verdict, expected in the spring, in relation to 130 charges brought against them for alleged breaches of Premier League rules. They have denied wrongdoing.\nCity have written to the league asking for arbitration over a new system of APT rules agreed by clubs before Christmas. The changes had been made in response to previous arbitration brought by City, which found aspects of the APT rules to be unlawful.\nIn a letter sent to clubs on Thursday the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, confirmed the arbitration request. “On 20 January, 2025, Manchester City FC began a further arbitration to challenge the APT rules,” he wrote. “As you will see, the new challenge relates to the amendments to the APT rules that clubs approved at the 22 November 2024 shareholders’ meeting. Manchester City FC seeks a declaration that the amendments approved by clubs in November (and therefore the current APT rules in force) are unlawful and void.\n“The Premier League remains strongly of the view that the amendments passed in November were lawful and the APT rules comply with all competition law requirements. We consider that the new arbitration must be resolved as soon as possible and, to that end, have agreed that the same tribunal should be appointed to hear the new case. The parties are currently corresponding in relation to further directions.\n“The APT rules remain in full force and effect and clubs remain required to comply with all aspects of the system.”\nCity, Aston Villa, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest voted against the new rules in November and Chelsea abstained. City had written to clubs before the vote arguing that the process was too hasty and Villa warned in a letter of more legal action from City.\n“It is now abundantly clear that any vote (if passed) will result in immediate further litigation by Manchester City FC and an associated defence by the EPL (English Premier League), incurring material further costs and unnecessary distraction and devotion of time to this issue,” the Villa letter said.\nCity and the Premier League have been approached for comment.\nMeanwhile, Pep Guardiola denied City invested £172m on four players in the winter window to mitigate against a potential transfer embargo if found guilty of the charges levelled against them by the league.\nCity historically sign very few players in the winter window but recruited Nico González, Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis. Guardiola was asked whether this was because of potential punishments.\nHe said: “I do not agree but my words will not convince people that our attributes are just being in a wealthy position. In the last five years, we are the last team in the top six for net spend.\n“Even after what we have spent in this transfer window, we are away from Chelsea, [Manchester] United, Arsenal, Tottenham. Even from Liverpool. The only reason why is because we sold a lot in the last seasons but even with that I know this club, it is always ‘just about the money’.\n“In one month I think there will be a verdict and a sentence and after we will see my opinion of what happened so far. Still, at the end, every club can do whatever they want. Because in the last 10 years we are third [for net spend], but in the last five even with what we won we are behind the top six teams, so I’m sorry for the comments and that is why I don’t agree.”\nGonzález, a midfielder, was bought because of the serious knee injury sustained by Rodri that is thought to be season-ending. Yet City have selected Rodri in their Champions League squad for the rest of the campaign. Guardiola was asked what chance the 28-year-old has of playing this term.\n“The rule is we can just add three players,” he said. “Vitor we cannot do it as he was the youngest [inexperienced] one. I would have loved to add all four to the Champions League [squad]. I would love to arrive in the latter stages of the Champions League and Rodri could help us but in my mind Rodri is for next season. Maybe he comes back earlier – that would be good for us.”"

    "raw_text": "What are the accusations against Manchester City?\nThe Premier League has charged the champions with 134 breaches of competition rules between the seasons 2009-10 and 2022-23. The charges cover four areas: a failure to give “a true and fair view of the club’s financial position”; a failure to “include full details” of player and manager remuneration; breaches of national and continental financial fair play regulations; and a failure to “cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations”. The counts will be heard by a three-person independent commission, starting on Monday, in what is thought to be a London location.\nDo we have specifics?\nThe Premier League has published only an extended charge sheet, with no details. The timeframes, however, suggest the charges line up with claims already in the public domain. First, that City inflated the value of sponsorship deals as a means of channelling more money from their owners into the club. Second, that secret payments were made to the manager Roberto Mancini and to the then agent of Yaya Touré. Third, that these acts left the club contravening financial rules. Fourth, that when the Premier League sought to investigate the claims, City obstructed it. City have always denied any wrongdoing.\nWhy do the charges matter?\nBecause of their seismic nature and implications, whatever the verdict. Because they are unprecedented in the domestic game. And because of City’s dominance. In the 14 seasons covered by the charges, City won seven Premier League titles, six League Cups, three FA Cups and the Champions League. Since then they have won another Premier League, the Uefa Super Cup and the Fifa Club World Cup. They have played in the Champions League every season from 2011-12. This has driven the global pre‑eminence of the Premier League and increasing transfer fees (City’s squad is worth £1bn-plus). There are arguments, too, that it has affected competitive balance here and across Europe, led to the near-development of a breakaway Super League (of which City were a part) and quickened the need for independent regulation of English football. In February 2023 when the charges were brought the La Liga president, Javier Tebas, called the English top flight a “doped market”. On Friday, he told Mundo Deportivo: “I have spoken with many Premier League clubs and most of them understand that City should be sanctioned.” If City are judged to have found success while breaking the rules, the game will come under greater scrutiny.\nWhat happens next?\nUnder Premier League instruction, Murray Rosen KC has selected three people to form the independent commission that will hear the charges, with one member of this panel required to be a financial expert. The hearings will be conducted privately and, though there is no formal timeframe, legal experts believe it will take a minimum of two months. When the commission publishes its verdict, either side can go to an appeals panel and, after this, arbitration. If all fails, either could attempt to find an argument to take to the high court. Under the rules of association of the Premier League there is no opportunity for either party to go to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) in Switzerland.\nIf guilty, what could the punishment be?\nAccording to rule W.51 in the Premier League handbook, a commission has the ability to levy a wide range of sanctions against any club found to have broken the rules. These include fines, the docking of points and suspension, or even expulsion, from the competition. In fact, subclause W.51.7 states that the commission can “impose upon the respondent any combination of the foregoing or such other penalty as it shall think fit”. That even leaves open the possibility of City being stripped of their titles.\nWhat do City say?\nThe champions are bullish. On the record the club says it “welcomes the review” and the opportunity to “impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position”. Club sources also say City were not informed of the charges before they were published online. Finally, they argue that the club has been under investigation for breaching financial rules before, and were cleared.\nHaven’t we been here with Uefa?\nIn 2020 Uefa suspended City from the Champions League for two years for “overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts” between 2012 and 2016, part of the same period covered by the Premier League’s charges. However, that sanction was overturned on appeal by Cas. In its ruling Cas found that a number of the claims brought by Uefa had fallen outside a five-year “time bar” which prevented historical charges. But the tribunal also argued that one key charge over payments relating to sponsorship by Etihad Airlines was “not established”. The panel said Uefa had submitted insufficient evidence and that, if its case had been correct, then City employees who had given testimony to Cas would have had to have been lying.\nIs this the result of ‘Football Leaks’?\nUefa found City in breach of its financial fair play regulations in 2014 but reached a settlement under which City paid a €20m (£17m) fine and submitted reduced squads to the Champions League. The revisiting of alleged irregularities came after the document hack known as “Football Leaks” exposed what appear to be official documents and email communication from inside City, alongside a number of other football organisations. The allegations against City were published in 2018. These documents are understood to also have prompted the Premier League’s investigation, a four-year process which has brought these charges. City have previously described Football Leaks as an “orchestrated campaign” and part of “an endless attempt to damage us”."

    "raw_text": "Manchester United enjoyed their night in Bilbao so much that they will surely be coming back. They remain the only unbeaten team among the more than 100 that have played this competition over eight long months, and even if they do fall to a first in seven days’ time, the margin of this victory means they should still be there on its final game in this same arena, the season given meaning and potentially a triumphant end, the Europa League their elixir and their escape once again.\nThey came to the stadium everyone calls the Cathedral and defeated Athletic Bilbao so convincingly that the second leg carries little threat. No one had won here this year in Europe and Athletic had conceded just 10 times in all competitions; United scored three in a quarter of an hour, an opening goal from Casemiro and two from Bruno Fernandes ending this before half-time. All the more so because the second came from the spot, accompanied by a red card for Dani Vivian, infuriating the home supporters and virtually ensuring that they will not play the final they host on 21 May.\nUltimately this was an efficient, impressive performance in which United looked something like the team they are supposed to be: one that can win a European title that has become their salvation and a glimpse, perhaps, of future hope, not least as it would give them Champions League access. One that ended up looking on a different level to their opponents, even if it hadn’t started that way.\nIn fact, Athletic began well, forcing the first corner and the first roar inside 90 seconds. United’s early possession was not so much a platform for them to do something as for Athletic to, ready to asphyxiate their opponents and accelerate with the robbed ball.\nThat front-footed approach, though, did expose them to the ball behind and just four minutes in, Manuel Ugarte released Alejandro Garnacho to finish. That was offside, but it was also a warning, an invitation to United to seek the same wing.\nAndré Onana had to save from Alex Berenguer, Iñaki Williams headed just over and when the Ghana international then raced up the right and pulled back, Victor Lindelöf made two decisive interceptions – the second on the line with Berenguer shooting from five yards.\nThat should have been the opener; instead, having resisted the pressure, it was United who got it just before the half hour. Ruben Amorim admitted that the first 25 minutes were not the same as the rest, the game changing with the opening goals and the red card.\nThe first goal was made by United’s unlikely hero doing unlikely things, more unlikely even than last time. Harry Maguire, the emergency striker who had completed that astonishing comeback against Lyon, smacking in a header on 121 minutes, now went all Stanley Matthews. If that had been latter-day Ronaldo, this was more like his teenage incarnation.\nFaced by Mikel Jauregizar on the right, Maguire turned one way and the next, went past his man and delivered the cross. Ugarte headed it on and, at the far post, Casemiro arrived to nod into the net.\nUnited doubled their lead two minutes later, and in a way that gave them even more of an advantage than the goal they scored. Again, it started on the right, where United had always identified opportunity.\nWhen the ball from Noussair Mazraoui came across the six yard box, Rasmus Højlund went down. Vivian accused him of diving but the defender was protesting too much. Højlund may have been quick to go to ground but there had been a clear hand on his shoulder and when the referee Espen Eskås came back from the VAR screen he pointed to the spot and pulled out a red card, double jeopardy doing for Athletic.\nVivian departed, Fernandes rolled in the penalty and this, it seemed, was done. Iñaki Williams did bend a shot wide but Athletic appeared gone and United added a third. Højlund scrambled for the ball, Ugarte provided the clever flick and Fernandes ran through to finish high. The lead might even have extended still further before half-time, when Mazraoui smashed one off the bar.\nThe protests which accompanied them off at the break increased early in the second when the referee was called to the screen to have another look at Maguire pulling down Maroan Sannadi.\nHe, though, decided that was no red card, any tiny hope that the numbers might be evened out – and a comeback would start – snuffed out. Instead, United controlled this, never in danger. They managed it with a certain comfort, a sense of superiority, and the threat, if not the need, of extending the lead still further.\nThere was another penalty appeal from Højlund, tangling with Yuri Berchiche. Ugarte and Casemiro both took aim from distance and the Brazilian put a header against the post. The frequency increased in the final 10 minutes, Julen Agirrezabala saving from Garnacho and Fernandes before Fernandes headed over and Højlund’s shot didn’t find the target.\nIñaki Williams had gone sprinting up the pitch, the noise from San Mamés rising as he ran, but Athletic were exhausted, defeated, and those chances were a reminder that this could still get worse.\nFor Manchester United, despite not adding the fourth, the night in Bilbao could hardly have been any better, and they will surely be back.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri have both insisted that protecting their teammates was central to McLaren’s use of team orders at the Italian Grand Prix and that they were focused on long-term success that would be fostered by doing the right thing, despite criticism after they were instructed to switch places at Monza.\nThe Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff, however, also noted McLaren’s adherence to such strongly held principles of fairness for their drivers may yet cause them serious headaches later in the season if Norris and Piastri end up toe-to-toe for the title.\nMax Verstappen won at Monza but McLaren’s use of team orders, having Piastri return second place to Norris after the British driver lost the position due to a slow pit stop caused by a faulty wheel gun, prompted no little controversy given the pair are in a two-horse race for the title, with Piastri now leading by 31 points.\nThe drivers and team principal Andrea Stella concurred that it had been the right thing to do as part of the agreed racing principles at McLaren but the drivers also emphasised that they felt it had also been part of a bigger picture looking to foster a positive environment within a McLaren team intent on going on to win further titles.\nBoth drivers were explicit in urging that they did not want any member of the squad to feel they had been responsible for having an impact on the result.\n“We’ve said many, many times now that we don’t want the chance of this success just for this year,” said Piastri. “We’re both at McLaren for a very long time and protecting the people around us that give us this opportunity is a very important thing. It’s easy enough to put yourself second at times like that.”\n“We want it for as long as possible and protecting the people includes the people doing the pit stops. It’s not a very nice feeling, I would imagine.”\nHis opinion was wholeheartedly backed by Norris.\n“The team is priority No 1 and drivers second,” he said. “That’s how it works. It’s only our second year of fighting for wins but the team gives us these opportunities. Without the team, then we’re just fighting for 10th and none of us want that. The spirit of the team is priority and we are below that.”\nWolff managed what became a fractious and bitter intra-team battle between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in 2016 which he described at Monza this year as “two lions in the den” who were “at each other’s throats”, but was intrigued how the McLaren commitment to fair play between its drivers would play out.\n“There is no right and there is no wrong,” he said. “I’m curious to see how that ends up. You set a precedent that is very difficult to undo. What if the team makes another mistake and it’s not a pit stop, do you switch them around?\n“We are going to get our response of whether that was right today towards the end of the season when it heats up.”\nHe also observed that how McLaren micro-manage the myriad potential variations for scenarios between the teammates will likely become only more complex.\n“What is a team mistake? What if next time around the car doesn’t start up and you lose a position or whatever, the suspension breaks,” he said. “What do you do then in the next one? So you could have a cascade of events that can be very difficult to manage.”"

    "raw_text": "Lando Norris bullishly dismissed criticism of McLaren for using team orders at the Italian Grand Prix, saying the team would continue to do what they felt was right “no matter what people say”. His teammate Oscar Piastri, who ceded his place to the British driver, also maintained he had no regrets in agreeing to do so.\nThe race was won by Max Verstappen for Red Bull, with the world champion enjoying enormous pace at Monza, while Norris and Piastri followed in second and third place. After Norris had held second almost the entire race, he dropped behind his teammate because of a slow pit stop caused by a wheel gun issue in the last laps and McLaren ordered the Australian to give the place back.\nPiastri did so and Norris went on to take second and three points out of his teammate’s championship lead, reducing it to 31 points. Both drivers accepted the decision on track and afterwards. Norris, who was booed on the podium, was forthright in his belief that McLaren had made the right call.\n“I don’t want to win this way, and the same with Oscar,” he said. “But we do what we think is correct as a team no matter what people say and what their opinions are and we will stick with that.\n“We are not idiots and we have plans for different things. If there were four cars between me and Oscar, of course he is not going to let me back past and that is correct. But if there is a situation where we are racing and you can be fair, you would expect to be fair as a team.\n“Today was not my fault. If I came flat out into my box and I hit all my mechanics I would not expect to get the position back. This was out of my control.”\nPiastri could have put three more points on his title rival by refusing to move over but agreed with Norris that he felt he had done the right thing according to the culture and racing ethos engendered at McLaren.\nWhen asked if he may have cause to regret the decision if he lost the title by three points, he was unequivocal.\n“I wouldn’t regret it, no,” he said. “It was a fair decision. Lando was ahead the whole race. It wasn’t through any fault of his own. For me, that’s fine. Ultimately, whoever wins the championship wants to have won it as much as they can through their own performances and things that they can control and today that wasn’t one of those things.”\n“Lando qualified ahead, was ahead the whole race and lost that spot through no fault of his own.”\nThe Australian said the drivers and team would review and discuss what had happened. Piastri had pointedly noted when given the order to move over that: “We said that a slow pit stop was part of racing,” suggesting the parameters of this situation had not in fact been entirely hammered out in advance and the team principal, Andrea Stella, also confirmed they would address them again.\n“We will review the case,” he said. “We will also review the situation whereby it was a slow pit stop in isolation. We already have our principles in relation to that. We will review our principles in relation to that and reinforce the direction if this is in agreement with our drivers.”\nNorris also took the booing from the fans, who had flooded on to the track beneath the podium, on the chin. “I heard them, but I don’t know what I am meant to do,” he said. “The cheers were louder than the boos, and that is the most important thing.”"

    "raw_text": "Max Verstappen took victory at the Italian Grand Prix with a dominant drive at Monza for Red Bull but, as the world champion hared across the finish line, the intra-team psychodrama at McLaren was playing out once more in his wake and its theatrical head‑to‑head was greeted with some disdain in motor racing’s colosseum.\nHaving fought a frenetic scrap on the opening laps, during which he lost and regained the lead, Verstappen went on to pound out a consummate run to the flag and in so doing beat the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri into second and third. The two title protagonists finished thus only after McLaren once more imposed orders on their drivers in the closing stages that proved controversial.\nThe debrief for McLaren will once more likely extend into the night, as the team pursued their goal of being scrupulously fair to both drivers. Some fans at Monza made their feelings clear, booing Norris as he stepped on to the podium, unhappy with how this particular brand of bread and circus had been stage-managed. Although of course the irony of Ferrari fans expressing displeasure at the application of team orders was of the particularly delicious variety.\nVerstappen was long gone up the road when it happened but his championship chances are similarly distant while Piastri and Norris are locked in a struggle for the title. Piastri led by 34 points going into the GP and Norris knows he must claw points back from his teammate at every opportunity.\nSo far so good then when he maintained his place in second in front of the Australian for the vast majority of the race, a minor swing of three points but what he required. The team had opted to keep Norris and Piastri out long to see if they could gain a free stop under the safety car but when none materialised they brought them in, choosing Piastri first but when Norris came in a lap later there was calamity once more.\nThe British driver, who was forced to retire at the last round because of an oil leak – ceding 25 points to his teammate – must be wondering which deity he has offended and quite how much blood-letting there must be before they are sated. On his stop it took two attempts to secure the left‑front wheel. Norris sat helpless until more than five seconds had passed and he could clear his marks. When he emerged from the pit lane, Piastri was in front, with Norris’s title chances seemingly reeling in another stroke of poor fortune. McLaren, though,wasted no time wading in.\nThey swiftly issued orders to Piastri to give the place back, telling their driver it was similar to the scenario in Hungary last year when Norris gave Piastri back the lead after he had gained it through stopping first from behind his teammate.\nPiastri remarkably and magnanimously took the decision on the chin, albeit while noting: “I mean, we said a slow pit stop was part of racing, I don’t get it.” He then duly gave Norris the place back with four laps to go. “I think we did the right thing,” Piastri’s engineer, Tom Stallard, told him.\nThe McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, explained later that it was the team’s commitment to fairness that had prompted the decision. They had wanted the positions to be unaffected by the pit stops and there was a two-point rationale to stopping Piastri first.\nThat it was to cover off Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc in fourth, although with the Monegasque driver 29sec in arrears this seemed over cautious but more importantly that if Norris was pitted first and a safety car or red flag followed he would have lost his place through no fault of his own. Erring then for caution and an effort to play it fair, Norris’s slow stop threw a spanner in the works.\n“The pit stop situation is not only a matter of fairness, it’s a matter of consistency with our principles,” Stella said. “However the championship goes, what’s important is the championship runs within the principles and the racing fairness we have at McLaren. The fact that we went first with Oscar, compounded by the slow pit stop with Lando, led to a swap of positions and we thought it was absolutely the right thing to go back to the situation pre-existing the pit stop and then let the guys race.”\nThey duly rectified it and both drivers accepted it – Piastri doubtless also considering the big picture. He lost only three points, still leads Norris by 31 and has established another major credit with the team that he may yet cash.\nHowever the methodology of quite how McLaren manages said accounts might be becoming somewhat labyrinthine. The risk is setting precedents that might become enormously complicated should the fight become tight at the end. Indeed, should it come down to as little as three points Monza will loom large.\nIt is hard to imagine almost any driver pairing that would take this with the same equanimity as Norris and Piastri, now or in the past. Indeed Verstappen’s reaction when he was told of the swap perhaps summed up what many were thinking. “Just because of a slow pit stop?” he said laughing with no little incredulity when told, as he powered to victory in front of the team who seem intent on taking the title with positively Stakhanovite evenhandedness.\nLeclerc finished fourth for Ferrari, with Lewis Hamilton putting in a credible run at his debut in Monza for the Scuderia, moving from 10th to sixth place, and George Russell taking fifth for Mercedes.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

Rather than dwelling on the pain of losing his US Open title and No 1 ranking, he was thinking about the future.\nSinner felt his game was too predictable, even one-dimensional, compared with Alcaraz, whose deep toolbox of shots left him uncomfortable and unable to find rhythm on the court. As a result of that discomfort, Sinner made a decision. The 24-year-old resolved to make significant changes to his game in pursuit of becoming a better, more complete tennis player and keeping up with his rival, even if he might suffer in the short term.\n“I’m going to aim to maybe even lose some matches from now on, but trying to do some changes trying to be a bit more unpredictable,” Sinner said. “Because I think that’s what I have to do, trying to become a better player.”\nIt was a remarkable admission, particularly considering Sinner’s own dominance in recent years. Over the past 52 weeks, the Italian holds a 51-1 record against opponents not named Alcaraz and is 74-1 against everyone but Alcaraz on hard courts since November 2023. He has spent the past two years destroying opponents, compiling 65 consecutive weeks at No 1. However, Alcaraz has now won seven of their past eight meetings. Only one player has forced him to make those changes.\nThis is firstly a reflection of his Spanish opponent’s greatness, already one of the best players in the game’s history, whose career continues to move at a historic pace. His first grand slam title at the US Open established him as the first teenage ATP No 1 in history, and now with his second success in New York he is the second‑youngest man to win six majors. At 22, he is also the fourth man to win multiple major titles on all three surfaces. He still has so much room for improvement.\nUnlike most of his other triumphs, there were no rollercoaster battles against lesser opponents or seemingly impossible comebacks against his toughest adversaries. He simply performed at a supreme level throughout the tournament, dropping his only set of the fortnight to Sinner. He was sublime in the final, letting rip with his forehand, which dictated the baseline exchanges throughout.\nHis peerless defensive abilities made the court feel so small for Sinner and, as the losing finalist admitted, his variety of shot just makes the Italian uncomfortable. “I feel I can do everything on court, to be honest: slices, drop shots, topspin, flat,” Alcaraz said.\nOne of the most significant factors in his success was his serve. For a long time, Alcaraz’s serve was the one ordinary part of his game. It was imprecise and inconsistent, particularly on important points, making it vulnerable against the best players. Alcaraz won his first US Open in spite of his serve, conceding 24 service games throughout the tournament. This time, he lost his serve just three times. Since 1991, only Pete Sampras at Wimbledon in 1997 has conceded fewer service games en route to a major title. It provided him with a platform for the rest of his game to flow and is a terrifying development for future opponents.\nSinner’s response to his defeat also showed why these two players will continue to tower over the rest of the tour for years to come. Although he did not feel he needed to make such significant changes to his playing style, Alcaraz’s reaction to losing against the Italian at Wimbledon was similar.\nAs soon as he left Centre Court, Alcaraz was also thinking about the improvements he needed to make in order to be better prepared for his next meeting with Sinner. “I spent two weeks before Cincinnati just practising some specific things about my game that I felt like I need to improve if I want to beat Jannik,” Alcaraz said.\nThis dynamic between them, the determination to outperform their rival, will also help them to stay ahead of everyone else. As was the case with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic before them, their increasingly frequent battles will mould them into better players as long as they are both at the top of the game. There is no room for complacency.\nAlthough they had already split the previous five grand slams between them, ahead of the French Open, Alcaraz and Sinner had never faced each other in a major final. They have now become the first men in history to contest three major finals in a calendar year. By New York, the prospect of a final between them felt inevitable, as if nothing but a freak injury or occurrence could stop it.\nMany things can happen in the future, but as things stand the gap is widening and for the rest of the players hoping to one day lift the biggest trophies in the sport, life is only becoming more complicated."

    "raw_text": "When Carlos Alcaraz is fully focused and his impossibly complete game is in full flow, nothing in the world can stop him. As he has spent the early years of his career collecting major titles at a breathless pace, this has been clear for a long time. On the biggest stage in tennis, he reinforced the sentiment with a stupendous performance against his greatest rival, completely outplaying Jannik Sinner, the No 1 and defending champion, to lift his second US Open title with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 win.\nAt the end of his most spectacular summer, Alcaraz will replace Sinner as world No 1, returning to the top ranking for the first time in two years. The 22-year-old also continues to mark himself as one of the greatest ever young players: he is the second-youngest man in the Open era to earn six grand slam titles, trailing only Björn Borg. He is also already the fourth man to win multiple grand slam titles on all three surfaces.\nThis match-up marked the first time the same men have competed in three major finals in the Open era in the same calendar year, with Alcaraz finishing the trilogy with a 2-1 lead. He now holds a 10-5 record over Sinner, winning seven of their past eight meetings.\nOn this occasion, Alcaraz could do anything he wanted with the tennis ball for the best part of three hours. He served brilliantly and struck his devastating forehand with total precision, but he also showcased his variation in full, constantly varying the pace, spin and trajectory of his shots. He kept Sinner off balance and unable to gain any rhythm with his destructive groundstrokes.\nThis was one of the most significant days of the tennis year, and yet the narrative was hijacked by the presence of Donald Trump, the US president. Overnight, Arthur Ashe Stadium was tightly encircled by airport-style security barriers and as fans began to queue up in order to enter the stadium, they were watched over by Secret Service agents. The men’s trophy was placed in the Rolex suite alongside Trump, which is not the usual protocol. When the US president was finally shown on the big screen at the end of the first set, most of the audience booed.\nAs 2pm approached, the embarrassment continued for the United States Tennis Association. Due to the dramatically heightened security, the queues to enter the stadium spanned across the tournament grounds and the start was delayed until 2.30pm. The final began with thousands of fans still waiting to take their seats. Hundreds were still outside during the second set.\nNobody, it turns out, was as excited for a rematch of the French Open and Wimbledon finals as Alcaraz himself. He was spellbinding from the beginning, every part of his prodigious game flowing. He continued the excellent serving form that has guided him through the tournament and he struck his destructive forehand with total freedom, dominating the baseline.\nAt the core of his performance, though, was the way he unfurled the various layers of his game, forcing Sinner to deal with skidding low slices, forays to the net, constant changes to the trajectory of the ball and drop shots. With the roof closed due to rain, the sterile indoor conditions were widely considered a positive for Sinner, but Alcaraz set the tone with a flawless opening set.\nAfter facing an hour of relentless pressure, Sinner dragged himself into the match on Alcaraz’s serve at 2-1, closing out a brilliant point after a masterful forehand drop volley to reach 0-30 before breaking serve to love. After hitting just two unforced errors in set one, Alcaraz’s growing error count allowed Sinner to grow into the match. Suddenly, Sinner was hitting his spots with his first serve and controlling many more of the exchanges with his destructive, metronomic ball striking as he efficiently levelled the match.\nLess than two months ago at Wimbledon, Sinner trailed Alcaraz by a set before bulldozing through the final three sets. There would be no repeat here. Alcaraz recovered, re-establishing his dominant serving, his variation and his control of the baseline. After snatching the opening break, he flitted through the third set to establish a two sets to one lead before immediately generating break points on Sinner’s serve.\nWith his back to the wall, Sinner fought desperately until the end. He won many of the frenetic, scattered cat-and-mouse points typical of this rivalry, including a stunning combination of volleys down break point at 0-1 in the fourth set that drew a finally full stadium to its feet. However, when he is in this mood, and everything is flowing so effortlessly, Alcaraz’s game can scale to heights that nobody else, including Sinner, can reach. Even now, six majors in, it feels as if he has only just begun.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Carlos Alcaraz described his US Open title run as the best tournament of his career after he defeated his rival Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 in New York to win his sixth grand slam title.\nAlcaraz’s victory caps off an incredible five-month run for the 22-year-old, who has reached the final of his last eight tournaments, winning six titles including the French Open and US Open. While many of Alcaraz’s previous triumphs included numerous five-set battles and dramatic comebacks – such as his recovery from triple match point down to defeat Sinner over five sets in Paris – this was by far the most efficient tournament of his career. Alcaraz dropped just one set in his seven matches and he lost his serve just three times in the entire tournament.\n“I feel like this is the best tournament [of my career],” said Alcaraz. “Since the first rounds to the end of the tournament, the best tournament so far that I have ever played. The consistency of my level during the whole tournament has been really, really high, which I’m really proud of, because it’s something that I’ve been working on, to be really consistent. I think this tournament I saw that I can play really consistent.”\nBy defeating Sinner, the defending champion and world No 1, Alcaraz will return to the top of the ATP rankings for the first time in two years. Since reaching No 1 for the first time in June 2024, Sinner had held the ranking for 65 consecutive weeks. Alcaraz described the No 1 ranking as one of his biggest goals of the season.\n“When you achieve the goals you set for yourself at the beginning of the year, it feels amazing,” said Alcaraz. “Since I got the chance to recover the No 1, it was one of the first goals that I had during the season, just to try to recover the No 1 as soon as possible or end the year as the No 1. For me, to achieve that once again, it is, as I said, it is a dream. Doing it in the same day as getting another grand slam feels even better. It’s everything I’m working for, and I’m really happy to be able to live these experiences.”\nWhile Alcaraz celebrated a victory that places him as the second youngest man to win six grand slam titles, behind only Björn Borg, Sinner was forced to digest his second grand slam final loss to Alcaraz this year. Sinner’s victory over Alcaraz at Wimbledon remains the only time Sinner has defeated Alcaraz in their last eight meetings.\nNinety minutes after the match had ended, Sinner had already begun to think about the improvements he wished to make in order to counter Alcaraz. He described himself as “very predictable” and he said he plans to make some changes to his game, even if it means losing more matches. “I was very predictable today, on court in the way of he did many things, he changed up the game,” said Sinner. “That’s also his style of how he plays. Now it’s going to be on me if I want to make changes or not, you know? We are definitely going to work on that.”"

    "raw_text": "Throughout this historic season, as he methodically climbed towards the top of his profession despite being a teenager in just his second full year on the ATP tour, Carlos Alcaraz was unfailingly clear about his objective: he was here to win grand slams. Not at some vague point in the future, or when he gained a little more experience, but now. He was ready.\nHe has backed up his intentions every step of the way and on Sunday evening he capped off his wild, thrilling ride to his maiden grand slam title by withstanding an intense challenge from Casper Ruud before powering on with his shotmaking and athleticism. He beat his Norwegian opponent 6-4, 2-6, 7-6, 6-3 to capture the US Open – and a grand slam title – for the first time in his young career.\n“It’s crazy for me. I’ve never thought that I was going to achieve something like that at 19 years old,” Alcaraz said. “So everything has come so fast. For me it’s unbelievable. It’s something I dream since I was a kid, since I start playing tennis.”\nHaving spent much of the past few years breaking age records, he will now take the most impressive one of them of all, one that could stand for a long time. Alcaraz will rise to world No 1 on Monday for the first time in his career, making him the youngest player to achieve the feat in ATP history. At 19 years and four months, the Spaniard is the first teenage No 1 the men’s game has ever had and more than a year younger than the previous record holder, Lleyton Hewitt.\nThe final marked the first time in the Open era that two players had faced each other with a maiden grand slam title and the No 1 ranking on the line. Alcaraz and 23 year-old Ruud, who reached the French Open final earlier this year, also contested the second-youngest grand slam final in the Open era in terms of player age, behind only the 1990 US Open between Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras.\nWhile he had played the best tennis at this tournament by a considerable distance, Alcaraz could not have faced a more difficult week leading up to the final. Before the start of his match with Ruud, he had spent 20 hours and 20 minutes on court, and had contested three consecutive five-setters. The Spaniard had been spectacular, but he consistently complicated his path. As the final began this year, the question was whether he would eventually reach his physical limits.\n“I always say that there’s no time to be tired,” said Alcaraz, smiling. “In the finals of the grand slam or any tournament. You have to give everything on court, you have to give anything you have inside.”\nAlcaraz started the match playing free, attacking tennis, unfurling his full array of shots, constantly sweeping forward to the net. Despite falling a set behind, Ruud was resolute. The Norwegian absorbed and retrieved everything he could, remaining steady, making high percentage decisions when he attacked.\nIn the process, Ruud came up with some sublime improvisational tennis, showing off his own hand skills in the cat-and-mouse points initiated by Alcaraz.\nBy the end of the second set, Alcaraz was struggling slightly, attempting too many failed drop shots and making questionable decisions as Ruud collected the set 6-2. As Alcaraz’s tennis seesawed at the beginning of the third set, Ruud began to serve well, injected more pace into his groundstrokes and imposed himself with his forehand. He made his move in a breathless game at 6-5, letting loose on his forehand from all parts of the court as he courageously generated two set points.\nWith his back to the wall, Alcaraz responded at the net, saving the first set point with a sweet forehand drop volley. Later in the game, a return from Ruud whizzed by Alcaraz as he tried to serve and volley, which produced a second set point. Without hesitation, the teenager attempted a serve and volley once again, this time executing a well-measured volley to save the set. It was audacious, and as he held serve with an overhead after a thrilling point, the crowd responded with a standing ovation.\nRuud had thrown everything into breaking serve and he was immediately deflated. He played a dire tiebreak, his backhand letting him down badly. He had no further answers for the supreme, dynamic shotmaking of Alcaraz as he surged to victory. As Alcaraz collapsed to the ground, he sobbed into his hands as he thought of his mother and grandfather back home in Murcia.\n“I’m hungry for more. I want to be in the top for many, many weeks. Hope many years,” said Alcaraz. “I’m going to work hard again after this week, this amazing two weeks. I’m going to fight for have more of this.”\nNot since the initial rise of Rafael Nadal, around the year of Alcaraz’s birth in 2003, has an arrival to the very top of the sport felt so certain. It has been even more spectacular than anticipated, with Alcaraz showcasing many layers of his greatness over the course of the last two weeks, from his athleticism to his endless toolbox of shots to his nerve and the sheer joy he takes from the game.\nIn a sport that often reduces teenagers to helpless cramping in their first years of contesting five-set matches, he has also shown a peerless durability throughout his 23 hours and 40 minutes on court. Alcaraz has given the world a thorough exhibition of his talent and potential, and there appears to be no limit to what he can achieve next.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "For most tennis players in history, a defeat as excruciating as Jannik Sinner’s brutal loss to Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final would have taken years to recover from. In Sinner’s case, the pain he endured simply made him stronger.\nOne month on from the toughest night of his life on a tennis court, Sinner turned the tables at the earliest possible opportunity, demonstrating his resilience by recovering from a set down to win his first Wimbledon title with a phenomenal performance, toppling the two-time defending champion, Alcaraz, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 6-4.\nSinner is the first Italian player to win a Wimbledon singles title and he now stands as a four-time grand slam champion. He breaks his overall tie with an assortment of famous names, including Arthur Ashe, Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka. Perhaps most important, he ends his great rival’s run of five consecutive wins against him, adding a new dimension to a rivalry that seems set to decide the majority of major tournaments in the near future.\nIn their own personal grand slam race, which still feels like it has only just begun, Sinner’s victory ensures that Alcaraz, who owns five major titles, remains within touching distance. This is also Sinner’s first slam title away from hard courts, after two victories at the Australian Open and last year’s US Open title.\nA month ago, Sinner stared blankly into space from his seat on Court Philippe-Chatrier while Alcaraz celebrated his triumph in their French Open final with his family in the stands. Sinner held three championship points, the match on his racket, in the fourth set before losing one of the greatest grand slam finals in history. It is a reflection of the Italian’s tenacity and mental strength that the 23 year-old has found his path again so quickly.\nThis is also Sinner’s first grand slam victory and overall title since his three-month doping ban between February and May. Sinner had tested positive for the banned substance clostebol last year before successfully arguing during his initial tribunal in August that the positive test had been a result of contamination, receiving no suspension. After the World Anti-Doping Agency chose to appeal the case, Sinner’s team and Wada eventually entered a case resolution agreement, essentially a settlement, agreeing on the three-month suspension.\nTheir three hours on Centre Court also showcased Sinner’s toughness. Despite how he frustratingly ended the first set, he kept on moving forward. Unlike a month earlier, Sinner played his best tennis in the decisive moments, serving brilliantly under pressure in the third set and maintaining his relentless aggression until the end, smothering the Spaniard with his constant pressure. Deep in the fourth set, as he faltered, this time Sinner held on.\nAside from his bizarre fourth-round match, where Sinner hurt his elbow and trailed by two sets to Grigor Dimitrov before the Bulgarian was forced to retire, Sinner had undoubtedly performed at a higher, more consistent level than Alcaraz throughout the tournament. For once, Alcaraz could not find a way back in through the sheer force of his competitive spirit.\nThings had not started so well for Sinner. After establishing a 4-2 lead in the first set, the Italian watched his lead evaporate as Alcaraz reeled off four consecutive games, closing it off with an angled backhand slice winner at the very end of his range.\nMinutes after demonstrating the stratospheric heights his game can reach, however, Alcaraz showed how quickly his level can fall. An unfocused start to the second set immediately left him trailing 0-40 and he eventually lost his serve. While his opponent’s level wavered, Sinner regained his rhythm on serve, which had faltered at the end of the first set, then he calmly continued to put Alcaraz under pressure on every point with his relentless aggression off both wings.\nThe essential third set was ultimately decided by their serving under pressure. While Sinner saved some of his best serving for key moments, following up a searing 117mph second-serve ace at 3-4, 30-30 with another service winner to hold, Alcaraz faltered. The Spaniard lost rhythm on his first serve at the end of the subsequent game as Sinner fearlessly connected with two brilliant second-serve returns, snatching the set’s decisive break.\nThe last time Sinner led two sets to one, all hell broke loose. He found himself at a similar crossroads while leading 4-3 in the fourth set as a series of nervous unforced errors sent him down 15-40. This time, he refused to let Alcaraz back in, digging himself out of a difficult hole and into the history books with the brand of bold, destructive shot-making that reinforced his status as the best player in the world.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "On a tranquil evening in Manhattan last week, Carlos Alcaraz was making his exit from an Italian restaurant with his sizeable support team when he unexpectedly found himself staring at a familiar face. There was Jannik Sinner, quietly enjoying his own dinner. This was the second occasion during the US Open Alcaraz and Sinner just so happened to be dining at the same restaurant at the same time. Neither player could hide their amusement as they greeted each other warmly.\nConsidering the frequency of their meetings it would not be unreasonable if they were starting to get sick of each other: “On court we like to see each other, because it means that considering our ranking, we are doing well in the tournament,” said Sinner.” Off court we bump into each other at times. I don’t know if we are happy or not.”\nThere is at least one more meeting to come in New York. The first US Open final of their rivalry also represents a historic moment. It is the first time in the Open era that two men have faced each other in three grand slam finals in one season, and in consecutive major tournaments. It also marks their fifth consecutive final, their most recent meeting coming in Cincinnati last month, when Sinner retired trailing 5-0 due to illness. As if the stakes are not already high enough, Sinner’s ranking is also on the line. If Alcaraz wins, he will replace the Italian as the world No 1.\nNot only are they so much better than the rest, but the gap is widening. While the Alcaraz-Sinner era had long been under way, with the two splitting all four major titles between them in 2024, until June they had not faced each other in a grand slam final.\nAfter they faced each other in the final of the Italian Open, Sinner’s comeback tournament from his three-month doping ban, a rematch at the French Open seemed likely. At Wimbledon, it was difficult to envision anything other than another final between them.\nBy the US Open, though, while they had six matches to win and the difficulty of navigating a grand slam draw should never be underestimated, this final seemed inevitable barring injury. It has made for an odd tournament over the past few weeks, with so much anticipation of this match from the first round.\nA month after Alcaraz demonstrated his peerless ability to produce his best in the most difficult moments by plotting one of the greatest comebacks of all time at Roland Garros, Sinner’s revenge win at Wimbledon broke a run of five victories for Alcaraz and showed Sinner a blueprint for success.\nThe Italian suffocated Alcaraz with his destructive, relentless ball-striking off both wings. He also served well and kept Alcaraz’s offensive return position at bay by injecting more pace into his second serve. The Spaniard admitted he had been outplayed. He did not have enough time on the ball to disrupt Sinner’s game.\nIt is for this reason that, although grass courts are supposed to be Alcaraz’s turf in this rivalry and Sinner has begun an era of dominance on the surface, Alcaraz may come to prefer facing Sinner on a medium-hard court. In addition to having slightly more time on the ball, this surface aids his kick-serve and the heavy topspin on his forehand, which are essential to his aim of constantly varying the trajectory of the ball to disrupt Sinner.\nAt Wimbledon, under such suffocating pressure on the baseline, Alcaraz’s serve let him down. In New York, his improved serve has been one of the key reasons why he has been able to roll through the field, reaching a grand slam final without dropping a set for the first time. It is obvious he will need to serve extremely well against the most effective returner in the game. Every match is an opportunity to adjust and it remains to be seen what Alcaraz has learned from his most recent defeat.\nThree years on from Alcaraz’s 2:50am, five-set win over Sinner after saving a match point, an instant classic that positioned this rivalry as the future of the sport, the pair will close that circle in New York.\nAs they walk down the tunnel and on to the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium, it is worth sparing a thought for others. After years of being punching bags for Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer it was believed the demise of the big three would lead to a transitional era where, at least for a short time, many more would have the chance to win the biggest titles.\nInstead, two new legends have emerged and though they are adversaries on the court they have also conspired to ensure nobody else has a chance."

    "raw_text": "Major League Soccer has suspended striker Luis Suárez three league games for his role in the mass brawl between his Inter Miami side and the Seattle Sounders after the Leagues Cup final. Suárez was at the center of the confrontation, first putting Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas in a headlock before being dragged away. Later, TV cameras caught Suárez yelling at, and spitting on, Sounders security director Gene Ramirez.\nSounders team psychologist Steven Lenhart, himself a former MLS player who was known for confrontations and physical play, has also had his credential revoked for the remainder of the 2025 season. Lenhart was among a large group of Sounders players and staff who joined the melee along with Inter Miami players and staff.\nNotably, Inter Miami midfielder Sergio Busquets escaped punishment, despite cameras showing him raising his hand to Vargas’ face, which escalated the fracas along with Suárez’s actions.\nThe ban means Suárez will miss Miami’s upcoming games at Charlotte FC on 13 September, at home in a rematch against the Sounders three days later, and another home game against DC United on 20 September.\nTogether, the suspensions from MLS are far less severe than those meted out by the Leagues Cup itself, which has its own disciplinary process and committee despite it being co-run by MLS. The Leagues Cup suspended Suárez for six games, Busquets for two, Lenhart for five, with an additional three-game ban for Miami defender Tomás Áviles.\nIt is entirely possible that, given the ages of Suárez (38) and Busquets (37) and the fact that both players’ contracts are up at the end of this season, neither will be made to serve any of their Leagues Cup suspensions. The MLS suspensions, meanwhile, will keep Suárez out of three crucial games as Miami aim to improve their playoff seeding. As of now, the Herons sit sixth in the East, four points out of a spot that would get them home field advantage in the first round of the playoffs, and 10 points back of the Supporters’ Shield.\nSuárez’s ban is roughly in line with past MLS suspensions for spitting, though in every recent case the spitting action itself was isolated and took place during the course of play. Héctor Herrera was suspended two games for being caught on VAR spitting at a referee in the Houston Dynamo’s final game of last season, while Real Salt Lake’s Jasper Löffelsend was given a similar suspension for spitting in 2023.\nSuárez posted an apology on Instagram four days after the final, saying that “It was a moment of great tension and frustration, where right after the match things happened that shouldn’t have happened, but that doesn’t justify the reaction I had … I was wrong and I sincerely regret it.”\nInter Miami posted a statement saying the club “condemns” the scenes that erupted after the final, but stopped short of apologizing."

    "raw_text": "The Seattle Sounders defeated Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday, and the time between the final whistle and the trophy lift offered eyebrow-raising scenes all their own.\nLuis Suárez, who got into a few minor altercations but was frustratingly goalless through the intense, physical match, took time after the final whistle to confront Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas. In that interaction, Suárez put his arm tightly around Vargas’s neck before being pulled away by Sounders players as players and staff from both teams joined the melee.\nAt one point, after being pulled away from a large group confrontation, Suárez was shown on camera berating Sounders director of security Gene Ramirez, then spitting on Ramirez as he was pulled away by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari and a Sounders staff member.\nThe incident is the latest controversy in a long career full of them for Suárez, including biting opponents on three separate occasions, numerous high-profile instances of simulation, and other moments of overly physical play or violent conduct.\nIn the past, MLS has handed down multi-game suspensions for spitting. Last season, Héctor Herrera was given a three-match ban for spitting in the direction of a referee – one game for the red card he received after VAR intervention, and two more from the league office. In 2023, Real Salt Lake’s Jasper Löffelsend was suspended for two games for spitting on an opponent.\nAfter the incident on Sunday night, Suárez collected his runners-up medal along with Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets, and the rest of the Miami team who were kept out by a stingy Sounders side that took advantage of their opportunities in front of goal.\nMiami, by contrast, spurned their own chances. Messi and Suárez combined in Miami’s best move of the night, but the Argentinian surprisingly put his effort from just a few yards out over the bar. Tadeo Allende, also could have equalized for Miami in the second half.\nOsaze De Rosario, the son of former MLS great Dwayne de Rosario, struck first in the 26th minute, and Seattle sealed the trophy with two goals in the game’s closing stages as Miami pushed numbers forward.\nOf chief importance in Seattle’s resistance was Vargas, the 20-year-old Alaska native who plays for Mexico’s national team. The defensive midfielder broke up numerous Miami attacks in central midfield, successfully intervening to snuff out runs from Messi and ensuring that Suárez rarely had the service he needed.\nThe flashpoint between Vargas and Suárez led to the larger confrontation between the teams that could see some key players banned for upcoming games in the stretch run of the MLS season. In that gathering, cameras showed Busquets put his hands to the face of Vargas, while multiple Sounders staff members seemed to escalate the situation by forcefully pulling Miami players away.\nWith the win, Seattle qualify directly to the round of 16 of next year’s Concacaf Champions Cup, while Miami qualify for the earlier stage of that tournament by virtue of making the Leagues Cup final. The trophy is Seattle’s ninth major honor since joining MLS in 2009."

    "raw_text": "In a change to his regularly scheduled programming, Mark Goldbridge took a break from blowing steam out his ears at another Andre Onana howler and venting his shouty exasperation at Manchester United’s latest calamity to talk – and watch – all things Gegenpressing and Ballbesitzfußball with his audience of over one million YouTube subscribers.\nThis was after the Deutsche Fussball Liga (DFL) struck an agreement with Goldbridge to broadcast 20 live Bundesliga matches on his That’s Football YouTube channel this season. Bayern Munich’s opening weekend win over RB Leipzig raised the curtain on the new deal, with nearly 500,000 viewers watching along with Goldbridge.\nMajor League Soccer is in the middle of its own streaming deal, but the league probably isn’t reaching such numbers for a single-game broadcast on MLS Season Pass. While the league has been coy on viewership since saddling up with Apple TV two years ago, Don Garber recently put the average number of viewers per match at 120,000, considerably lower than the 343,000 average viewers MLS was reportedly getting per match on ESPN in 2022.\nGarber would, and has, argued MLS is now judging its viewership numbers differently. “The media and pundits just don’t get it yet,” the commissioner told Front Office Sports. MLS was on linear TV for years and was never able to leverage that exposure into anything meaningful. While MLS attendance figures are among the strongest in the world, the league has long struggled as a TV product. The 10-year, $2.5bn Apple TV deal was an opportunity to move the goalposts.\nIn the time since MLS Season Pass launched, though, the broadcast landscape has shifted. Leagues are increasingly focused on drawing as many eyeballs as possible, wary of how disappearing behind a paywall can put them out of sight, out of mind. The Bundesliga clearly just wants to be seen, hence its deal with the (red) devil.\nOf course, the Bundesliga’s hiring of a chuntering rage baiter is controversial, especially when the rage baiter in question once said “the German league is shit.” However, his audience of young, Gen Z fans is clearly hard to ignore, as is the fact YouTube boasts over 122 million daily active users. Unlike MLS, the Bundesliga has gone to where the audience already is; it hasn’t asked fans to come with them to a new (and niche) streaming service.\nThe Apple TV deal has had some benefits for MLS. The league has, in a literal sense, never looked better. The Athletic reported that last season, no match was broadcast using fewer than 10 cameras. Whereas previously it wasn’t even a guarantee that matches would be broadcast in 1080p, now all games are bright and beautiful, albeit dependent on the strength of your wifi connection.\nFor the fan who wants a broad view of the league, it’s handy to have everything all in one place. Gone are the days of frantically searching for a game before kick-off only to find coverage had been delayed due to a college basketball game that had overrun. MLS’s RedZone-style whiparound offering – MLS 360 – is also an entertaining, if slightly anxiety-inducing, watch every Saturday evening.\nIn many other ways, though, MLS is handcuffed by Apple. Could MLS 360 ever be broadcast on YouTube, where so many live streams have found success? As long as Google is a direct competitor to Apple, it seems unlikely (even if highlights are currently uploaded to YouTube).\nOther leagues that have launched a streaming service of their own like MLS Season Pass have enjoyed some success. Most notably, Ligue 1’s new Ligue 1+ service attracted 600,000 subscribers in its first week, going a long way to reaching its target of one million by the end of the 2025-26 season.\nThe Premier League has also hinted at the potential launch of a Netflix-style service in some countries and territories. The English Football League operated a centralised streaming platform called iFollow for a number of seasons until Sky Sports took over rights last year.\nThese, however, are leagues in countries where soccer is an easier sell, where the sports landscape isn’t as competitive as it is in the US. MLS isn’t just up against the Premier League and Liga MX and every other soccer league around the world, but the NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLB and NHL too – all of which have more linear TV exposure than MLS, and by a lot.\nThe docuseries Onside: Major League Soccer was the league’s attempt at replicating Drive To Survive, which has been transformational for the fortunes of Formula 1. The eight-episode first season was interesting enough, providing a glimpse behind the scenes that did something to round out the likes of Riqui Puig and Pat Noonan as personalities.\nBut with this too, MLS missed the boat. There’s a golf Drive To Survive. There was a tennis one too. Amazon’s All Or Nothing series has focused on several teams from the Dallas Cowboys to Manchester City and the Brazilian national team. Welcome To Wrexham has made an impact, turning a lower league Welsh club into a global brand, but countless other teams and leagues have chased the Drive To Survive effect without much success.\nWhile MLS’s deal with Apple TV once felt admirably radical, it has since fallen behind the curve. MLS Season Pass is essentially the same product now in its third season as it was on the day it launched, the only major differences being that some commentary is now done remotely (a downgrade) and the creation of Sunday Night Soccer (a welcome development).\nSome MLS clubs are so desperate to be back in the public eye that they have struck agreements with local networks to show matches on a tape delay. The league still has some linear TV exposure through a sub-licensing arrangement with Fox, but those matches often feel like an afterthought.\nWill we ever see, say, Soccerwise broadcast a live MLS match on YouTube like Goldbridge will for the Bundesliga 19 more times this season? Could MLS do anything more to plug itself into the vibrant online community around American soccer? Could it go where the fans already are?\nMaybe, but MLS needs Tim Cook’s permission first."

    "raw_text": "Thomas Tuchel has said that England’s youngsters will have no fear against Serbia and backed his team to make a statement in their daunting World Cup qualifier in Belgrade.\nSitting in a small room overlooking the pitch at the imposing Rajko Mitic Stadium, there was a sense of Tuchel geeing himself up as he looked outside and took in his surroundings before previewing the clash on Tuesday between the two strongest sides in Group K.\nEngland’s head coach is under pressure to produce a standout performance despite starting qualifying with four wins from four. The football has been uninspired at times – England underwhelmed in attack during their 2-0 victory over Andorra at Villa Park last Saturday – but Tuchel believes facing Serbia in a ferocious atmosphere can ignite his reign.\n“It is always the opportunity and I’ll always see it like this,” the German said. “This game is the opportunity and I think it will bring out the best in us that we are here in Belgrade.”\nHarry Kane and Tuchel both mentioned the intimidating nature of the tunnel, which is the longest in Europe at 240 metres. “The tunnel is not so agreeable,” Tuchel said. “But that’s what it’s all about now. It’s nice, you’re in this country, this sporting nation, full of emotional people, full of quality in every sport – especially in sports that have a ball.\n“They are so talented and determined. That’s the beauty of it and if you want to go to a World Cup and to play for the national team, experiencing this is the beauty. Tomorrow is one of these nights. And we’re up for it.”\nEngland, who top the group by five points, are missing a host of key players and are short on experience. There could be another start in midfield for Elliot Anderson, who impressed on his debut against Andorra, while Morgan Rogers, Tino Livramento, Morgan Gibbs-White and Myles Lewis-Skelly do not have many caps between them. Yet Tuchel, who said that Marc Guéhi has shaken off the groin issue that forced him off against Andorra, believes his players will rise to the occasion.\n“Afraid of nothing,” Tuchel said. “The group was excellent throughout the week and everyone deserves to play. It is good, we have some difficult choices and some narrow decisions to make. We will have a strong bench and age is not decisive.”\nTuchel hopes that Jordan Henderson can play a vital leadership role even if the veteran midfielder is not in the starting lineup. “Jordan has played here, Harry [Kane] has played here and they have talked already about it,” he said. “The spectators will be emotional, they will be loud.”\nThe expectation is that England will face another deep five-man defence. Tuchel is working on creative solutions. He is without Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka but believes that their replacements will not be weighed down by anxiety.\n“When the chance comes you have to take it or other guys will come and take your place,” Tuchel said. “That is the nature of elite sport. I think it has been an excellent camp with an excellent group. They are all very confident and eager to play.”\nThis is England’s first trip to Belgrade since facing the old Yugoslavia in 1987. Tuchel’s players have held a meeting about the possibility of racist abuse from the crowd. The stadium’s capacity has been reduced by 15% because of fan behaviour when Serbia faced Andorra in June.\nBranko Radujko, general secretary of the Football Association of Serbia, has used his programme notes to urge spectators not to spoil tonight’s occasion. “In addition to the spectacle we expect on the pitch, let me draw attention to something just as important: behaviour of all of us in the stands,” he said. “This match of truth also carries great responsibility.\n“We are still under special monitoring of Uefa. Every inappropriate reaction, insult or incident could cost us dearly on our path to the USA, Mexico and Canada, including the possibility of having to play a decisive match with Albania behind closed doors.\n“That is the reason I sincerely and seriously call on you: let us cheer from the heart but let it be fair. We can be loud but dignified. Let our support be a source of strength, not a risk for the national team.”"

    "raw_text": "Over what range will you fire? Probably not more than 400ft. Will the gentleman be moving? Stationary. What about the chances of a second shot? Well, I might get the chance. But I doubt it.\nTen months before the epic landscapes of World Cup USA 2026, the Day of the Jackal seems a pretty good cinematic model for the mission Thomas Tuchel is facing. As England trundle through the familiar autumn rhythms of a tournament preamble, it is probably time for some real talk about the sui generis one-shot task the Football Association has devised for its head coach.\nIt is of course still necessary to take a view on Andorra at home and the more urgent test of Serbia away on Tuesday night, because they are happening now, because this is content and the football brain demands its chemical hit. But Andorra was dull. Senegal at home and Andorra away were poor. We know how this works, the background throb of social media, radio chat, England angst channelled reflexively into dark talk about progress, signs, culture, finding your best team.\nAt which point it is also necessary to take a step back from these well-grooved anxieties, because the task at hand is also very different this time. First because the goal that has been set for Tuchel – win the World Cup or die – is both absurd and bracingly aspirational. England have a good team. Reaching a final is possible, because finals have been reached before. Why not try something different now, crank the lever to 11, apply a little wild short-term pressure?\nBut it is also important to accept that this changes what needs to happen now. We can already say with some clarity the success or failure of the Tuchel project is likely be defined by a single passage of football, half an hour in New Jersey or San Francisco next summer. The mission is agreeably stark: can you beat Spain, France or similar in a knockout game? Can you find that moment, the mid-match tactical rejig, clarity under pressure?\nA game of walking-football in early autumn has always been an entirely separate thing to the sharp end of a tournament, at best a chance to finesse and think about the future. It is now entirely irrelevant. For the first time being England manager is overtly not about making something. Tuchel is not president of the republic, out there building a culture. He is instead the Jackal. The mission is a one-off hit, a headshot from the balcony, using only the tools within his reach.\nUnderstanding the nature of that mission is key at this stage, for Tuchel himself, but also for those on the sidelines. We are hardwired to look always for wider progress. Recent history tells us World Cups are won by building things. The French academy system. The German academy system. Argentinian genius-ball. We remember the Gareth days, which were all culture, the sense that a kindly anteater in a waistcoat is going to repoint your entire house even if it kills him in the process. As far back as the Graham Taylor era there was a sense of trying to express some half-understood form of Englishness, a benevolent nativism, like trying to cure knife crime with trolleybuses and Morris dancing.\nTuchel is being asked to do the exact opposite. Building a culture, finding an entirely un-English form of self-expression against the nihilism-ball of Andorra. This is a distraction. The job is to find tactical hacks for when England are playing a totally different kind of game, when the ball has suddenly disappeared, the midfield been suffocated, when victory is about shifting the energy against a better team.\nIt is vital to know what the Tuchel era is not. Do not build a team in your own image. What’s the point? There’s a team already there. England managers always need a thing, a gimmick. Don’t have one of these. There isn’t time. Don’t experiment too much or reach too high. It was perhaps a good thing Tuchel was missing six key players against Andorra, players who will be vital to the actual test, the high‑end stuff next July. The fix, if there is to be a fix, will be the simplest, shortest route, uncluttered by more complex notions of team building.\nNo doubt Tuchel himself appreciates this. Although before Andorra there were still some slightly worrying noises. What, for example, is this?\n“We tried to give solutions in the first two camps through the structure. We played different structures in the buildup and put players in new positions. Maybe I underestimated the effect that it has. Maybe we translated it a little too much from club football and we need to take a step back to speed up our game with a bit more freedom and less changes within the structure. Maybe the solution comes from running more, from more energy than the structure.”\nNo, Thomas. Just no. This is all valid, complex, finely tuned chat. But it’s also culture stuff. It’s anti‑clarity at this stage. This is macro-management, not the one‑shot killer with a mercury bullet in his Zimmer frame. You don’t ask the Jackal to explore the mechanics for democratic change. And if you did the Jackal would become distracted, would lose his sniper sight case on the bus. You ask him for one clean shot and leave the future to other people.\nTuchel said other culture-based things. He questioned whether England’s players actually loved or just liked representing the national team. Do you really want to open that box, to unravel those unravellable feelings? Remember Gary Cooper. The problem with Gary Cooper? They got him in touch with his feelings. In the end they couldn’t shut him up. Eleven months. Four proper games. We don’t have time for resets, for anything more than target practice.\nWith this in mind it was good to hear Tuchel again after Andorra, when he was broadly encouraged, but seemed uninterested in drilling down into the details. And Tuesday night does at least present something more urgent, at this stage the most useful pre‑World Cup assignment of the entire Tuchel project.\nThe only other games in the book right now are Wales at home, Latvia away, Serbia at home and Albania away. There will be friendlies in the new year, but no high-grade tactical test of the type Tuchel will face when the moment arrives.\nArguably the best possible preparation would be to end up in a playoff, to be tested in March in a way that is at least analogous to next summer and the need for winning on the fly, feeling the tactical moment in your body and blood, to borrow from Fabian Hürzeler after Brighton’s comeback against Manchester City last week.\nWith any luck the Red Star Stadium (now known as the Rajko Mitic Stadium) will be the right kind of hostile. Serbia are good enough to have periods of domination. In an ideal world England would concede first, or struggle with their shape, demand a mid-match rejig.\nSuccess at the World Cup is likely to come down, as ever, to the midfield balance, a search for players brave enough to keep the ball in knockout games against elite opponents. Elliot Anderson seems likely to get a chance in Belgrade. He is clearly a calm, technically gifted option. Ideally he too will struggle, battle with the occasion, and give the manager some evidence that he can also overcome this.\nFor now this is the only kind of practice that matters, not another turgid night watching English footballers struggle with the idea of free expression against a low block. Come the day of the Tuchel, the target will be stationary, the mission parameters defined, a one‑off shot from the balcony. Until then everything else is just noise."

    "raw_text": "Lamar Jackson has admitted he should have held his feelings in check after he shoved a fan who slapped him during his team’s loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday night.\nThe Baltimore Ravens quarterback was celebrating a touchdown in front of the home crowd in Buffalo when a fan in a Bills jersey slapped Jackson and teammate DeAndre Hopkins on their helmets. Jackson shoved the fan, who was ejected from the stadium. ESPN later reported that the fan has been banned from all NFL stadiums.\n“He slapped me, and he was talking – so, I just forgot where I was for a little bit,” Jackson said after the game, which the Ravens lost 41-40 in the final seconds. “You have to think in those situations. You have security out there; let security handle it. But I just let my emotions get the best of me. Hopefully, it doesn’t happen again. I learned from that.”\nJackson, a two-time NFL MVP, said he enjoys interacting with fans and plans to continue doing so.\n“I’ve never seen our fans do that,” Jackson said. “So, I’ll probably do it again when we score a touchdown. It’s not nothing against the fans. I’m just celebrating when my teammates get a touchdown.”\nJackson had an excellent game against the Bills, one of the Ravens’ long-time rivals in the AFC. He threw for 209 yards and two touchdowns, and rushed for another. His touchdown pass to Hopkins put the Ravens up 34-19 with 1:09 left in the third quarter but the Bills scored 16 points in the final four minutes to seal a thrilling victory."

    "raw_text": "Josh Allen led Buffalo to three scores in the final four minutes, the last a 32-yard field goal by Matt Prater as time expired, and the Bills rallied from 15 points down to stun the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in a season-opening Sunday night thriller.\nBuffalo scored 16 points in the last 3:56, with Prater’s kick capping a nine-play, 66-yard drive over the final 1:26.\n“Our team doesn’t quit,” Allen told NBC. “There’s people that left the stadium. And that’s OK, we’ll be fine. But have some faith next time.”\nAllen went 33 of 46 for 394 yards with two touchdowns and scored two more rushing in a matchup of the NFL’s past two MVPs. He spoiled a strong performance by Lamar Jackson, the 2023 MVP who went 14 of 19 for 210 yards and two scores while adding 70 yards rushing and another TD. Derrick Henry rushed for 169 yards and two touchdowns for Baltimore but also contributed to the loss by fumbling with 3:06 left.\nAfter the Bills got within 40-32 on Allen’s 10-yard touchdown pass to Keon Coleman, Henry lost the ball and the Bills capitalized, with Allen scoring on a one-yard run. The two-point conversion attempt failed, but Buffalo got the ball back and Allen led his team to a memorable victory.\nThis prime-time matchup lived up to the preseason hype as a rematch of Buffalo’s 27-25 win over Baltimore the divisional round of last season’s AFC playoffs.\nThe Ravens scored on seven of their first eight possessions and went ahead 40-25 on Henry’s 46-yard run with 11:42 left.\nThe fans even got involved, with Jackson shoving back at a man in the end zone while celebrating DeAndre Hopkins’ 29-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter. The fan struck Hopkins in the helmet, and attempted to do so to Jackson, who responded by pushing the man back into his seat.\nAllen oversaw last-minute scoring drives to close each half, with Prater hitting a 43-yard field goal on the final play of the second quarter.\nThe 41-year Prater, who didn’t have a team at the end of August, made his Bills debut, replacing the injured Tyler Bass.\n“It wasn’t me. It was everybody,” Prater said. “Offense setting it up. The snap, the hold. They were money all day. So I just had to come in and swing my leg ... I was just fortunate to be in the opportunity to kick it.”\nDetroit Lions 13–27 Green Bay Packers\nJordan Love threw a pair of touchdown passes and Micah Parsons produced a sack in his Green Bay debut as the Packers delivered an exceptional defensive performance in their victory over the Detroit Lions. The Packers won their 13th consecutive home opener. The Packers scored points on their first three drives to pull ahead for good. The Packers’ convincing win over the two-time defending NFC North champions represented a fresh start after they went 1-5 in divisional games last season.\nPittsburgh Steelers 34-32 New York Jets\nAaron Rodgers threw four touchdown passes in his Steelers debut, leading Pittsburgh to an enthralling victory over the New York Jets. Chris Boswell kicked a go-ahead 60-yard field goal with just over a minute remaining. The Jets, who lost in coach Aaron Glenn’s debut, had a chance to drive for a potential winning field goal when they got the ball back with 56 seconds remaining. On fourth-and-three, Justin Fields connected with Garrett Wilson for what could have been a first down – but Jalen Ramsey smacked into the Jets receiver, who couldn’t hold on to the ball. Fields, also playing against his former team, ran for two touchdowns and threw for another. Rodgers was 22 of 30 for 244 yards with four TD passes.\nMiami Dolphins 8–33 Indianapolis Colts\nDaniel Jones threw one touchdown pass and ran for two more in his Indianapolis debut to lead the host Colts to a comfortable victory over the Miami Dolphins.\nJones, who won the job over Anthony Richardson in preseason, completed 22 of 29 passes for 272 yards, and the Colts forced three early turnovers to score 30 unanswered points. The Colts scored on all seven of their possessions while the Dolphins turned the ball over on three of their first four possessions leading to 17 Indianapolis points. Tua Tagovailoa was responsible for all three of those giveaways, throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble on a strip sack by Kenny Moore II that was recovered by former Dolphins safety Xavien Howard.\nSan Francisco 49ers 17–13 Seattle Seahawks\nThird-string tight end Jake Tonges caught a deflected pass for a touchdown with 1:34 remaining, and the San Francisco 49ers rallied for a narrow season-opening win. He finished with three catches in relief of injured All-Pro tight end George Kittle and came down with a 50-50 ball from a scrambling Brock Purdy for a four-yard TD. Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen got a hand on the ball but it bounced off him and Tonges grabbed it. Sam Darnold moved the Seahawks into position to win his debut with the franchise but was strip-sacked by Nick Bosa on the San Francisco nine-yard line.\nNew York Giants 6–21 Washington Commanders\nJayden Daniels threw for 233 yards and a touchdown, Deebo Samuel scored in his Washington debut, and the Commanders kept the New York Giants out of the end zone in a comfortable victory. Last seen allowing 55 points to Philadelphia in the NFC championship game, Washington’s defense had a much better time of it against the Giants. New York managed only 231 yards of offense and was particularly ineffective running the ball. Daron Payne had a sack and batted down a third-down pass, and the Commanders never let Russell Wilson look comfortable in his first start with New York. Wilson went 17 of 37 for 168 yards.\nCincinnati Bengals 17–16 Cleveland Browns\nCincinnati’s defense secured a narrow win over the Cleveland Browns. The Bengals, under new coordinator Al Golden, forced two second-half turnovers, including DJ Turner’s interception with 1:24 left. Cincinnati won an opener for the first time since 2021. New Cleveland kicker Andre Szmyt missed two crucial kicks, including a potential game-winning field-goal attempt. Joe Burrow completed 14 of 23 passes for 113 yards and a touchdown. The Browns outgained the Bengals 327-141 but fell short on the day. Joe Flacco passed for 290 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.\nTennessee Titans 12–20 Denver Broncos\nBo Nix overcame three turnovers as the Denver Broncos spoiled Cam Ward’s debut with a win over the Tennessee Titans. Nix threw a touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton, and rookie RJ Harvey’s 50-yard run set up JK Dobbins’ 19-yard touchdown. Ward finished with no touchdowns or interceptions. Quarterbacks taken first overall are now 4-14-1 in season openers since the start of the common draft era. Tennessee had a chance to tie late but went three-and-out.\nHouston Texans 9–14 Los Angeles Rams\nMatthew Stafford threw for 245 yards and a touchdown while becoming the 10th quarterback in NFL history with 60,000 yards in the air, and Braden Fiske recovered a fumble forced by Nate Landman with 1:43 to play in the Los Angeles Rams’ victory over the Houston Texans. Puka Nacua had 10 catches for 130 yards for the Rams, who went ahead on Davis Allen’s TD catch on the opening drive of the third quarter. Neither team scored again in a choppy opener. CJ Stroud passed for 188 yards for the Texans with several sharp throws despite playing behind a struggling offensive line.\nLas Vegas Raiders 20–13 New England Patriots\nGeno Smith threw for 362 yards and a touchdown, rookie Ashton Jeanty rushed for his first career touchdown and the Las Vegas Raiders rallied to beat the New England Patriots. Tight end Brock Bowers had five catches for 103 yards before leaving in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. Jakobi Meyers added eight catches for 97 yards. Maxx Crosby and Malcolm Koonce also added sacks to help give Pete Carroll his first victory as Raiders coach.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers 23–20 Atlanta Falcons\nRookie Emeka Egbuka caught two touchdown passes, including a go-ahead 25-yarder with 59 seconds remaining, and Tampa Bay recovered after losing the lead on a marathon drive by Atlanta to beat the Falcons in a dramatic game. Following Baker Mayfield’s 25-yard pass to Egbuka, Chase McLaughlin’s missed extra point gave the Falcons an opening to force overtime with a field goal. Michael Penix Jr moved the Falcons into field goal position in the final minute. Younghoe Koo was wide right on the 44-yarder.\nCarolina Panthers 10–26 Jacksonville Jaguars\nTrevor Lawrence threw a touchdown pass, Travis Etienne ran for 143 yards and the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Carolina Panthers to give their new regime a debut victory. Brian Thomas Jr also ran for a score for Jacksonville, who controlled both lines of scrimmage and kept Lawrence upright all afternoon. The game was delayed for nearly 90 minutes because of nearby lightning strikes. Bryce Young turned in another season-opening stinker. He had a TD pass to Chuba Hubbard, two interceptions and a fumble. He also made a head-scratching throw out of the back of the end zone on a fourth-down play.\nArizona Cardinals 20-13 New Orleans Saints\nKyler Murray threw two touchdown passes and the visiting Arizona Cardinals spoiled Kellen Moore’s debut as an NFL head coach.\nMurray passed for just 163 yards while completing 21 of 29, but his scoring passes to Marvin Harrison Jr and James Conner made the difference for the Cardinals, who were 8-9 last season. Spencer Rattler completed 27 of 45 for 214 yards with no touchdowns for Moore, who was hired by New Orleans after being Philadelphia’s offensive coordinator during the Eagles’ Super Bowl title run last season. The Saints, who were 5-12 last season, were penalized 13 times for 89 yards as their NFL-leading streak of six consecutive wins in season openers came to an end.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "As revenge games go, this one was pretty sweet. Aaron Rodgers led the Steelers to a 34-32 win over the Jets, his former team, and over a coaching staff that fired him before they had the decency to check out his crystal collection.\n“I was happy to beat everybody associated with the Jets,” Rodgers said on Sunday, after throwing for 244 yards and four touchdowns in his Pittsburgh debut.\nRodgers spent two bleak seasons with the Jets. First came the torn achilles that ended his first campaign almost before it began. Then, he slogged his way through a second year of mismanagement, playing for a franchise that effectively waved the white flag before Halloween. In Sunday’s comeback, he offered a glimpse of what could have been.\nThis was not vintage Rodgers. He is not the same as he was during his final years in Green Bay. At 41, he’s a little stiffer, more cautious, happy to dump the ball off to avoid getting hit. The four-time MVP is no longer the artist he was at his apex, the backfield ballerina who could create magic out of nothing. These days, he takes sacks in slow motion, unable to avoid the oncoming rush. But he is still has a supercomputer between his ears, a high-powered arm and a preternatural feel for how to punish defenses.\nAsk Rodgers to be the driving force of an offense in 2025, and you’re heading nowhere. But slot him in a role as the league’s pre-eminent quarterback-as-point-guard, with weapons at receiver and a complementary defense, and he can carry a franchise far.\nThere were times on Sunday when Rodgers’s flaws were exposed. He was sacked on his first play from scrimmage and was fortunate not to throw the game away with a late fourth-quarter misfire. But beyond the stat line, Rodgers showed a willingness to reimagine his game, to accept the player he is today rather than what he was during his MVP years. And the Steelers have built an offense around that reality.\n“I love the organization. I love them taking a chance on bringing me in,” Rodgers told CBS after the game. “There’s a lot of garbage being talked about myself or [offensive coordinator Arthur Smith] or how we would coexist.”\nWhether or not Rodgers would subsume himself to the Steelers’ offense or force his own ideals on the coaching staff was an open question. Those were answered on Sunday. He was happy to hand over the reins in a way he never did in New York, playing with a quick trigger and shuffled outside the pocket on Smith’s designed rollouts and bootlegs. When needed, he proved he can still thread the ball into tight windows.\nThe Steelers still needed help. The team’s vaunted pass-rush drew a blank against the Jets’ offensive line, giving Justin Fields time to carve them up for 266 yards and three touchdowns combined through the air and on the ground. Jets linebacker Quincy Williams helped bail out a Steelers stalled drive with an avoidable unnecessary roughness penalty, which Rodgers punished with his third touchdown. And when DK Metcalf somehow hauled in a late reception that bounced fortuitously off two players, Chris Boswell nailed the 60-yard game-winning field goal.\n“Our kicker is a serial killer,” Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said. “He has a low pulse rate … and he cannot wait to deliver.”\nWinning shootouts is not a formula for winning a playoff berth, not at this stage of Rodgers’s career. But the foundations of something are there: Rodgers refusing to turn the ball over and then turning the game over to his defense and kicker.\nFor the Jets, the loss will sting. Rodgers spent much of his two years in New York vacillating between off-field distraction and on-field liability. He sulked and moped. He pointed fingers. The franchise caved to most, if not all, of his demands: coaching hires, the structure of the offense, questionable free-agent signings, trades and unexcused absences. By the end, the headache was no longer worth the production. His final meeting with new Jets coach Aaron Glenn was quick, cold and combative, according to Rodgers. Given Fields’ first start, Glenn is probably happy with his call.\nIt remains to be seen if Rodgers can hold up to the rigors of a 17-game regular season and the promise of the playoffs – or if the honeymoon phase will wear off. But there are few things in sport as intoxicating as seeing the old guy who still has it. At least for four quarters, Rodgers showed that it is foolish to bet against a Hall of Famer having one great season left in him.\nMVP of the week\nJosh Allen, QB, Buffalo Bills. So … that was intense. There were moments during the Bills’ 41-40 instant classic victory over the Ravens when Allen looked like the greatest player of all time. There were moments when Lamar Jackson looked like the greatest player of all time. There were moments when Derrick Henry looked like the greatest player of all time (until his fourth-quarter fumble that changed the momentum of the game). And when 41-year-old Matt Prater, who wasn’t even on the Bills a few weeks ago, kicked the winning field in the final seconds, there were plenty in Buffalo who would have sworn he was the greatest player of all time. But Allen gets the plaudits for leading his team back from 15 points down in the four minutes – his final line for the evening included 394 passing yards, two passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns – displaying a compelling blend of calm, physicality and football smarts.\n“Our team doesn’t quit,” Allen told NBC in a post-game interview. “There’s people that left the stadium. And that’s OK, we’ll be fine. But have some faith next time.”\nConsider yourself told.\nStat of the week\nThe Colts won a Week 1 game for the first time since 2013. Welcome to the Danny Dimes era, Indianapolis. The Colts clubbed the Dolphins 33-8 to open the season, with Daniel Jones becoming just the fifth quarterback in NFL history to throw for 250-plus yards and run for two or more touchdowns in a season opener. Jones also became the first quarterback to lead a scoring drive on every single possession in a single game, according to NFL Research. That’s right! Jones, in his first week as the Colts starter, put together a performance unmatched by Patrick Mahomes, Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Nathan Peterman or … anyone.\nJones dismantled a dismal Dolphins defense, playing with a confidence he has rarely displayed since his rookie season. In New York, Jones became tentative, falling apart under pressure and chasing checkdowns rather than attacking defenses down the field. In his debut for the Colts, Jones drilled throws to all levels, completing 10 of his 13 attempts for 160 yards and a touchdown outside the numbers. In the red zone, he showed off his wheels and toughness, extending plays and scoring on two quarterback sneaks. He won’t face Miami every week, but Jones showed he can be a viable starter in Shane Steichen’s system.\nVideo of the week\nDid we get a catch of the year contender in garbage time of week one? You bet.\nThere’s Lions rookie Isaac TeSlaa, offering up his best Odell Beckham impression in a blowout 27-13 defeat to the Packers. The Lions have plenty of questions swirling around them after a heavy defeat. But TeSlaa is not one of them; he is an immediate star.\nElsewhere around the league …\n-- The Micah Parsons era in Green Bay has begun. Ten days after being traded by the Cowboys, Parsons was on the field for the Packers, terrorizing the Lions. Dealing with a back injury, Parsons played fewer than 50% of Green Bay’s defensive snaps. But his impact was immediate, commanding the attention of the Lions’ offensive line and allowing the rest of the Packers’ defense to feast. Parsons finished the game with three pressures. The results of those pressures: a two-yard loss on a completion, an interception and his first sack as a Packer.\n-- It may be time for Mike McDaniel to go condo shopping. Expectations for the Dolphins were low this season, but their performance against the Colts in the opener was putrid. Miami looked unprepared, undisciplined, and overmatched in their loss to the Colts. The franchise has poured a ton of resources into its defensive front, which couldn’t sniff Jones on Sunday. The secondary, an afterthought all offseason, confirmed itself as the weakest group in the league. And that’s before you get to the offense, McDaniel’s speciality, which was a disjointed mess. It’s one week, but everything is already on the table in Miami: McDaniel’s job, Tua Tagovailoa’s starting role, and Tyreek Hill’s future.\n-- The Bengals have made a habit of stumbling out of the gate under Zac Taylor, and this year was no exception. Cincinnati edged past Cleveland 17-16 on Sunday, but only thanks to the assistance of rookie Browns kicker Andre Szmyt. Joe Burrow and the Bengals’ offense struggled to find rhythm, eking out just seven yards of offense in the second half. Yet the Browns couldn’t capitalise. Szmyt missed two big kicks on his NFL debut, including a 36-yarder that would have given Cleveland the lead late in the fourth quarter.\n-- If you had Jake Tonges deciding a critical division game in Week 1, congratulations. Tonges, a third-string tight end and career special teamer, entered Sunday with zero career receptions. But he caught the game-winning touchdown against the Seahawks in a 17-13 win for the 49ers, replacing the injured George Kittle.\nBrock Purdy had a brutal season opener for San Francisco, throwing two interceptions and almost coughing up a couple more. But when the Niners needed Purdy to deliver most, he did. On third down, he scrambled around and threw a jump ball to Tonges, who snagged the ball before Riq Woolen could pick it off.\n-- We have a fun quarterback rivalry brewing in the NFC South. Baker Mayfield and Michael Penix Jr exchanged clutch drives in the Bucs’ 23-20 win over the Falcons. Penix, making just his fourth career start, led his third fourth-quarter go-ahead drive, capping it with a gravity-defying rushing touchdown to put the Falcons ahead with 2:17 remaining. But Mayfield had the last word, finding rookie receiver Emeka Egbuka for his second touchdown of the day with 59 seconds left. Tampa missed the extra point, handing Atlanta one last chance, and Penix drove the Falcons into field-goal range. But Younghoe Koo pushed his kick wide, and the Bucs escaped with the win.\nPenix was again denied an early career-defining performance by his defense and special teams. But the small sample size is growing larger each week; Penix has the tools to be a franchise quarterback. “I told him after the game, he’s going to be a problem in this league for a long time,” Mayfield said of Penix post-game. “I think he’s a great player. He’s young, but he’s got it.”\n-- He may not act it, but Pete Carroll became the oldest head coach in NFL history on Sunday. At 73 years and 357 days, in his debut with the Raiders, Carroll oversaw a 20-13 win over the Patriots. The win also made Carroll the first coach to win his debut with four different franchises. Vegas struggled to run the ball and had multiple coverage breakdowns on defense, the antithesis of everything Carroll preaches. The good news: the Raiders may have the most explosive passing game in the league. Geno Smith threw for 362 yards and a touchdown with one interception, averaging 10.6 yards per attempt in his Raiders debut. Smith spread the ball around to eight different receivers, four of whom averaged more than 20 yards a catch.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "It’s been telling how much of the coverage around England recently has focused on how they must improve before the World Cup finals next summer. It’s true, of course: they’ve been in the final of the last two Euros, played well in getting to the quarter-final of the last World Cup and have a fleet of extremely gifted players but have not really impressed since beating Greece in the Nations League under Lee Carsley last November.\nWhat’s never considered, though, is the thought that they may not get to the 2026 World Cup at all.\nEngland travel to face Serbia on Tuesday, having won four out of four without conceding a goal. But three of those four games have been at home and two of them have been against Andorra. They still have to go not only to Belgrade but also to Tirana to face Albania. Serbia could only draw away there, which offers a little breathing space, but were England to lose on Tuesday, they would be under pressure. The home game against Serbia in November could end up as a shootout for who takes the group’s sole automatic qualification slot and who is forced into the playoffs. It’s a jeopardy to which England as a whole, having not missed out on a World Cup since the last one staged in the USA, in 1994, have perhaps not quite adjusted.\nFor the major nations of western Europe, the assumption seems to have been that the expanded World Cup would mean guaranteed qualification – and understandably so. This is not 1978 when there were only 16 qualifiers and England and Italy faced off in a four-team qualifying group with only one to make it to Argentina. It’s not even like 1994, a 24-team tournament, when England were grouped with the Netherlands, a very good Norway and a decent Poland, plus Turkey and San Marino, with two qualifying from that cohort. Even after expansion to 32 sides, England found themselves in groups with Italy (for 1998) and Germany (for 2002), with one to qualify directly and the other to face a playoff. The current qualification group with Serbia, Albania, Latvia and Andorra was potentially awkward rather than daunting.\nAnd yet England are not the only side with a reasonable chance of winning the tournament facing up to the fact that their presence in North America next summer may not be a fait accompli. South American qualifying is as good as done – that 10-team megagroup is now a flawed splurge of largely meaningless content when there are six qualifiers and a playoff spot on offer. Brazil had a real wobble in autumn 2023, losing three games in a row, yet still qualified with ease. All that remains to be settled there is whether Venezuela or Bolivia will take the playoff spot. New Zealand predictably took the Oceanian slot. The usual suspects – Japan, South Korea, Iran and Australia – have qualified from Asia, but so too have the first-timers Jordan and Uzbekistan, with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Oman and Indonesia to contest the final three places.\nIt’s in Europe and Africa, though, where perceived giants could be in trouble. Morocco, semi-finalists in 2022, have already secured their place. Senegal, though, trail DR Congo by a point with three games to go and face a monumental game in Kinshasa on Tuesday. Lose that and, if they finish as one the best four (of nine) runners-up, they will play off for the right to be Africa’s representative in the intercontinental playoffs (two qualifiers from six). Cameroon, similarly, are a point behind Cape Verde, whom they face in Praia on Tuesday. Nigeria are in an even worse position. They kept hopes alive with an unconvincing 1-0 win over Rwanda on Saturday but lie behind both South Africa and Benin, both of whom they have still to play, in their group.\nEurope’s qualifying is not so far advanced and the picture less clear, but Germany’s 2-0 defeat in Slovakia on Thursday added a frisson of anxiety. A home victory over Northern Ireland was necessary but far from comfortable; next month’s game in Belfast looks unexpectedly critical. Belgium’s draw away to North Macedonia in June has them looking anxiously at next month’s game away to Wales, even after comfortable wins this month over Liechtenstein and Kazakhstan.\nBut it’s Italy, four-time world champions, who, having missed out in 2018 and 2022, are in the biggest trouble. They were beaten 3-0 away to a Norway side finally beginning to play to the level of their best individuals in June and, after drawing 0-0 at home after 45 minutes to Estonia on Friday, there seemed a possibility they might not even take the playoff slot. Five second-half goals changed the mood, but Monday’s fixture against Israel (to be played in Debrecen, Hungary) represents a major test. Lose that, and although they’d have a game in hand, they’d be six points off second.\nEven with 48 teams qualifying, in Europe and Africa, World Cup qualification cannot be taken for granted.\n-\nThis is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from the Guardian US at the game in Europe and beyond.

    "raw_text": "Tostão picks up the loose ball and nudges it back to Wilson Piazza just outside his own box. The ball is moved in a slow triangle through Clodoaldo to Pelé and Gérson and back to Clodoaldo. His touch is slightly heavy, enticing an Italian challenge. Clodoaldo skips round him and then two other tackles. He sidesteps Antonio Juliano and rolls the ball to Rivellino on the left. Rivellino sweeps a 40-yard pass down the line to Jairzinho and the rhythm has suddenly changed.\nJairzinho runs at Giacinto Facchetti and, as he turns inside, Pierluigi Cera advances to close him down. Jairzinho pokes the ball on to Pelé, perhaps 27 or 28 yards out. Tarcisio Burgnich stands between him and the box, but Pelé pauses, turns casually to his right and lays a pass into the path of Carlos Alberto, surging forward from full-back. Just inside the box the ball bobbles so it sits up perfectly. Carlos Alberto doesn’t have to break stride as he lashes a shot hard across goal, the force of the strike lifting him high off the ground as the ball flies into the bottom corner. With four minutes of the 1970 World Cup final remaining, Brazil lead 4–1.\nFor many, it’s the greatest goal scored by perhaps the greatest team in the greatest World Cup, a glorious synthesis of team play and individual technical excellence. Yes, it came right at the end of the final and Italy were exhausted by then, accepting their defeat, but it was a goal that encapsulated the joy and virtuosity of that side, that left the world with a shorthand for what the Brazil of 1970 meant.\nAnd if by the time it was scored it was almost a goal without an opposition, an exhibition, that felt appropriate too, for Brazil by then had come to feel as though they were about more than games or results, more even than winning the World Cup: they were about an expression of football in its most beautiful form, about pushing the boundaries of human capability.\nThe impact of Brazil’s victory on the global imagination was profound. This felt thrillingly modern. For those who had colour television, who witnessed those vibrant yellow shirts and the shorts of cobalt blue playing with a dash and a verve in iridescent heat on the sun-bleached grass of Mexico, the impact is hard to overstate.\nThe tournament revelled in the sense of progress, naming the official ball the Telstar, after the satellite that made live global transmission possible. And Brazil, after all, had undergone a Nasa-approved training course before the World Cup. When the Jornal do Brasil claimed that “Brazil’s victory with the ball compares with the conquest of the moon by the Americans” the previous year it didn’t seem ridiculous.\nJust as the moon landing could be regarded as a triumph of human ingenuity, so Brazil’s artistry seemed to transcend the tournament, the petty squabble of nation against nation. Much of what posterity has remembered of Pelé in that tournament – the lob from the halfway line against Czechoslovakia, the header that drew the stunning save from Gordon Banks, the dummy on the Uruguay goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz in the semi-final – didn’t lead to goals, as though this was about more than the bureaucracy of the scoreboard; it was about the greater glory of the game.\nEver since, there has been a sense of football trying to recapture the spirit of 1970, that feeling of rapturous and perhaps impossible excitement. By the time of the 1974 tournament in West Germany, João Havelange had been elected president of Fifa and a new age of commercialism had begun.\nIt’s not to present Stanley Rous’s tenure as Fifa president as anything other than flawed to suggest that, when a former schoolteacher was replaced by the son of an arms dealer, a certain financial innocence was lost. The 1970 World Cup looks different to every subsequent World Cup because not every surface is covered in advertising. The marketing was not slick, the presentation imperfect, and in that ramshackle aspect there was perhaps a charm: the football, by and large, came first.\nAnd the football in 1970 was thrilling. The contrast to the physicality of the two previous World Cups and England’s cautious, mechanistic win in 1966 was obvious and for many those two facets became fused: this tournament was modernity and it had been won by Brazilian artistry, therefore such artistry was modern. But it was not. It had been made possible by the heat and altitude of Mexico that, with the fitness of players as it then was, effectively made pressing impossible. By 1974 in West Germany, pressing was back.\nBrazil’s World Cup victory in 1970 still has a mythic quality, their performance still used as a shorthand for the best that football can be: it’s what gave Pelé’s “beautiful game” cliche currency. That it became fused in the popular imagination with the technology that made it possible to witness the tournament live across the globe is natural: the Telstar was both satellite and ball, ball and satellite, and Brazil’s mastery over one was disseminated by the other. Their attacking football was brilliant, but this was a tournament just as tawdry, just as mired in political chicanery, and just as blighted by poor refereeing as any other.\nThe aptest analogy for the 1970 World Cup from the previous year, then, is perhaps less the moon landings than Woodstock, a festival of love and artistry that has come to embody a moment of lost possibility. Like Woodstock, the future offered by the 1970 World Cup was perhaps always implausible.\nThe popular conception of Woodstock – great crowds high on the prospect of peace and love, listening to Jimi Hendrix, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Joan Baez – stems largely from the over-idealised Michael Wadleigh documentary, released three months before the 1970 World Cup. The reality was chaos: several acts performed hours late; a fence was broken down by anarchists leading to potentially dangerous overcrowding; two people were killed, one of them run over by a tractor; and a worn electric cable combined with persistent rain raised the possibility of mass electrocution.\nThe 1970 World Cup, similarly, once you peer beyond the brilliance of Brazil’s football, becomes a much more sinister event. Mexico’s governing PRI was repressive and capable of extreme violence. And in Brazil, along with short-term economic growth, victory in Mexico, and its associated modernity, was presented as part of President Emílio Garrastazu Médici’s “Brazilian miracle”.\nThe result is that the 1970 World Cup stands amid the darkness as a fragile vision of perfection and possibility, of what football can be, what it could have been. It is, in effect, the equivalent of that epiphanic pause before Pelé lays the ball right in the 86th minute of the final. But where that pass was followed by the explosive fulfilment of Carlos Alberto’s shot, football itself went awry. That World Cup is the scene in Easy Rider, another cultural touchstone of 1969, in which Wyatt (Peter Fonda) tells Billy (Dennis Hopper): “We blew it.”\nLike Wyatt and Billy, Fifa took the money and, while much was gained, much also was lost.\nThis is an edited extract from The Power and the Glory: A New History of the World Cup by Jonathan Wilson, published by Abacus, £25.

But the qualifiers for the 2030 World Cup will begin in 2027, when he is 40.\nThe Argentina captain scored in the 39th and 80th minutes. He was denied a hat-trick in the dying moments when his effort was ruled out by an offside flag. Lautaro Martínez added a goal in the 76th.\nMessi has 36 goals in South American World Cup qualifiers and remains the all-time scoring leader. His Inter Miami teammate Luis Suarez has 29 goals in continental qualifying, but he has retired from international duty.\nLooking ahead, Messi clarified that he will only compete in next year’s World Cup if he feels physically fit.\n“Same as I said before about the World Cup that I don’t think I’ll play another. Because of my age, the most logical thing is that I won’t make it,” he said. “But well, we’re almost there so I’m excited and motivated to play it. Like I always say, I go day by day, match by match. That’s it, taking it day by day, going by how I feel.\n“Day by day, trying to feel good and above all, being honest with myself. When I feel good, I enjoy it, but when I don’t, honestly, I don’t have a good time, so I prefer not to be there if I don’t feel good. So we’ll see. I haven’t made a decision about the World Cup.\n“Match by match, I’ll finish the season, then I’ll have preseason, and there will be six months left. So we’ll see how I feel. Hopefully I’ll have a good preseason in 2026 and finish this MLS season well and then I’ll decide.”\nAlready qualified, the World Cup champions extended their tally to 38 points and will remain atop the South American qualifying standings regardless of what happens in the last round next Tuesday.\nDefeat for Venezuela confirmed Uruguay, Colombia and Paraguay joined Argentina, Brazil and Ecuador as the automatic qualifiers from South America.\nColombia and Uruguay marked their qualifications with 3-0 wins over Bolivia and Peru respectively, while Paraguay and Ecuador drew 0-0. Brazil beat Chile 3-0 in the night’s other match.\nVenezuela have a one-point lead over Bolivia with one match remaining in the fight for a play-off spot"

    "raw_text": "Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, has suffered his worst electoral defeat since taking office, as he faces his administration’s most serious corruption scandal and signs that the economy is slowing.\nIn local legislative elections on Sunday for Buenos Aires province – home to almost 40% of the country’s electorate – the coalition led by the self-styled anarcho-capitalist was beaten by the opposition by 47% to 34%.\nThe result might have been trivial had Milei himself not given national weight to the vote and even the air of a plebiscite on his government, having previously described it as a “life-or-death battle” against the opposition.\nAnalysts say that beyond public dissatisfaction with the economic squeeze, Milei was heavily damaged by the recent revelation of an alleged corruption scheme involving the president’s powerful sister, Karina.\n“This is not yet the worst moment of the Milei government, but the beginning of its worst moment,” said sociologist Juan Gabriel Tokatlian, noting that on 26 October the president will face an even greater challenge, in midterm elections to renew half the lower house and a third of the senate.\nThe president acknowledged the “clear defeat” and admittedto having made non-specific “political mistakes” that “we will accept, process and correct”.\nBut he said he would not “retreat by a single millimetre in government policy. The course is not only confirmed: we will accelerate and deepen it even further.”\nIn Sunday’s elections, only seats in Buenos Aires province were at stake – not including the capital of the same name. It had held its elections in May, which were won by the president’s party.\nMilei has slashed public spending, dismissed tens of thousands of public employees and led a major deregulation drive since taking office in December 2023. But in recent months, things have begun to go wrong for him.\n“The economy has not advanced sufficiently, inflation has not been brought down in any significant way, and wages have been practically frozen,” said Tokatlian, a professor of international relations at the Universidad Torcuato Di Tella in Buenos Aires.\nThe government faced a cryptocurrency debacle after the president promoted an obscure token called $Libra, which soared in value following his endorsement before collapsing dramatically, prompting dozens of criminal complaints alleging fraud.\nMilei also vetoed bills that would have increased pensions and disability benefits, but last week, the national congress took a step not seen in more than 20 years and overturned the president’s veto.\nSigns of Milei’s growing unpopularity were already evident when, nearly two weeks ago, he was pelted with stones by demonstrators while campaigning for Sunday’s election.\nAlejandro Daniel Pons, 57, an architect from Mar del Plata, voted for Milei in the 2023 presidential election but chose not to vote on Sunday because he did not want to back either the president’s party or the opposition.\n“[Milei] should keep governing because he does know about economics, but he went too far in squeezing ordinary people. That mistake has now come back to haunt him at the polls,” Pons said.\nTurnout was nearly 65% – about 10% lower than in the previous local polls. According to Tokatlian, those who stayed away were precisely the voters who, in 2023, had backed Milei over Peronism – the name given to Argentina’s main leftwing movement, in reference to former president Gen Juan Domingo Perón and his wife, Eva.\n“This time the anger is with the government,” he said.\nUniversity student Valentina Villagra, 27, who lives in the district of Hurlingham, said that finding work has become extremely difficult, and the jobs that do exist offer very low wages.\n“Faced with a government that is determined to purchase power and wipe out all the human and social rights we have built … the only possible response was Peronism,” she said."

    "raw_text": "Argentina’s president Javier Milei is facing his administration’s worst alleged corruption scandal – involving none other than his hugely influential sister, Karina – less than two months before key legislative elections.\nFor more than a week, news in the country has been dominated by audio recordings in which a former government official is heard discussing the alleged payment of bribes linked to the purchase of medicines for people with disabilities.\nIn the recordings, Diego Spagnuolo, the head of the National Disability Agency and a former Milei lawyer, claimed that the sister of the self-styled anarcho-capitalist allegedly pocketed 3% from each contract.\nSpagnuolo initially denied it was him in the tapes, but later admitted it and was dismissed by the government after the furore.\nAfter days of silence, Milei appeared alongside his sister – an influential figure in his administration – at a campaign rally, asking the crowd to give her a “big ovation”.\nAfter a summer in which the wild-haired president was celebrated even by the British right, political analysts in Argentina see the case as the most damaging blow yet to Milei.\n“It’s the biggest scandal his administration has faced,” said Juan Courel, an expert in political communication from Alaska Comunicación.\nThe scandal first emerged on 19 August, when the streaming channel Carnaval released the first audio recordings, the source of which is still unknown.\nIn the recordings, Spagnuolo claimed the alleged scheme was channelled through the pharmaceutical firm Suizo Argentina, which allegedly demanded 8% kickbacks from other companies seeking government contracts.\nThe scheme reportedly generated between $500,000 and $800,000 per month in bribes, with 3% of that amount allegedly going to Milei’s sister, Karina, who is the secretary general of the presidency – a role she was able to assume because Milei scrapped a decree barring relatives from public office.\nSpagnuolo also said he had warned the president about the supposed fraudulent dealings: “I said to him: ‘Javier, you know they are stealing, that your sister is stealing’.”\nAs the scandal spread, lawyer Gregorio Dalbón filed a criminal complaint against Milei, Karina, Spagnuolo and others named in the recordings. Dalbón has represented former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner – Milei’s main political adversary who was herself banned from politics for life and put under house arrest in June after the supreme court upheld a six-year sentence for corruption.\nDalbón described the allegations against Milei’s government as “the greatest corruption scandal since democracy was restored in 1983”, adding: “I don’t rule out that this could be this government’s Watergate.”\nA federal judge ordered an investigation and police raids at dozens of addresses. At the home of one of Suizo Argentina’s owners, $266,000 in cash was seized.\nDuring a campaign event last Saturday, Karina did not mention the case directly, but said: “We are ready to fight, to keep watch so they [the opposition] don’t steal from us any more.”\nThe president also avoided addressing the case directly, but reposted on his social media a statement from Suizo Argentina, in which the company said it was “fully available” to the courts to “clarify the facts under investigation, fully convinced it had acted in complete compliance with current rules and laws”.\nOpposition lawmakers filed a motion to establish an investigative commission to probe the corruption allegations. “So far, there have been no convincing explanations about what happened,” said Esteban Paulón, the socialist deputy who introduced the bill. “And that is serious because it undermines the government’s credibility.”\nOn 26 October, Milei will face his first midterm election, with half the seats in the lower house and a third of the senate up for grabs.\nAccording to Lara Goyburu, a political scientist and executive director at the consulting firm Management & Fit, the scandal could affect voter turnout and poses a greater risk to Milei than the cryptocurrency debacle.\nIn February, the president promoted an obscure token called $LIBRA, which soared in value after his endorsement before collapsing, prompting dozens of criminal complaints alleging fraud.\nGoyburu said the “audio scandal” resonates more with the public because it occurred “in an organisation that works with a vulnerable sector of the population” and because it appears closer to the “old-fashioned corruption” Milei had promised to fight."

    "raw_text": "The president of Argentina, Javier Milei, has been pelted with stones while campaigning near the capital Buenos Aires by demonstrators protesting about allegations of corruption involving his influential sister.\nThe far-right leader, who was whisked from the scene by his security detail, sustained no injuries after his motorcade was attacked, presidential spokesperson Manuel Adorni wrote on X.\nAs Argentina prepares for legislative elections in October, Milei’s campaigning has been overshadowed by his administration’s worst alleged corruption scandal .\nFor more than a week, the country’s news agenda has been dominated by the repercussions of leaked audio recordings in which a former government official can be heard discussing the alleged payment of bribes linked to the purchase of medicines for people with disabilities.\nIn the recordings, Diego Spagnuolo, head of the National Disability Agency and a former Milei lawyer, claimed that Milei’s powerful sister, Karina Milei, pocketed 3% from each contract.\nOn Wednesday, Milei and his sister were riding in the back of a pickup truck and greeting supporters in Lomas de Zamora, 20km (12 miles) south of Buenos Aires, when protesters began throwing plants, rocks and bottles at their vehicle.\nThe vehicle quickly left the scene. Afterwards, scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the libertarian leader.\nShortly afterwards, Milei posted on his social media a photo showing a stone flying just above his head, accompanied by the words: “CIVILISATION OR BARBARISM. KIRCHNERISMO NEVER AGAIN,” a reference to the opposition led by former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner.\nThe justice minister, Patricia Bullrich, wrote on her social media that the attack had been organised by Fernández’s supporters.\nBut others suggested that the stone-throwing was a reaction to the alleged corruption scandal.\nMinutes after the incident, the Buenos Aires governor, Axel Kicillof, a former economy minister under Kirchner, said at another campaign event: “Milei, the people have already seen through you: fraudster, liar” – though he did not mention the stone-throwing.\nShortly before the attack, Milei broke his silence on the corruption allegations, telling reporters: “Everything [Spagnuolo] says is a lie … We are going to bring him to justice and prove he lied,” referring to the man who, according to Argentine media, was once close to Milei and a frequent visitor to the Casa Rosada.\nKarina Milei has not addressed the allegations. The president’s sister assumed the post of secretary general of the presidency after Milei scrapped a decree barring relatives from public office, and she is widely seen as the “chief architect” behind her brother’s rise to power.\nKnown as El Jefe (the male boss) by insiders including the president himself, Karina Milei is said to decide his agenda, political alliances and which journalists he will or will not speak to.\nThe scandal allegations, which public prosecutors are investigating, represent what could be a major threat for Milei in the run-up to the provincial legislative elections in Buenos Aires – which account for almost 40% of the electorate – on 7 September, and the national elections on 26 October.\nThe vote will be the first big test of his support since the libertarian economist took office in December 2023 on a promise to revive Argentina’s ailing economy.\nLara Goyburu, a political scientist and executive director at the consulting firm Management & Fit, said the scandal could affect voter turnout because it appears closer to the “old-fashioned corruption” Milei had promised to fight."

    "raw_text": "A majority of people across the EU’s five biggest member states believe the European Commission sold citizens out when negotiating a “humiliating” tariff deal with Donald Trump that “benefits the US” far more than Europe, a survey has shown.\nThe poll, by Cluster17 for the European affairs debate platform Le Grand Continent, found 77% of respondents – ranging from 89% in France to 50% in Poland – thought the deal would benefit above all the US economy, with only 2% believing it would benefit Europe’s.\nAcross the five countries, which accounted for about 60% of the bloc’s population, an average of 52% described the deal agreed in July by Trump and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, as a “humiliation”.\nUnder the deal, the EU is to remove tariffs on all US industrial goods and provide preferential market access for a wide range of US seafood and agricultural goods. Most EU goods entering the US, however, will be subject to a 15% baseline tariff.\nIn addition, EU firms are to invest an extra $600bn (£443m) in the US, and the bloc must buy $750bn of US energy and dramatically increase spending on US defence exports – requirements viewed negatively by more than two-thirds of poll respondents.\nVon der Leyen hailed the agreement as “a huge deal” that brought “stability” and “predictability”, as well as avoiding Trump’s threatened 30% tariff rate. However, commentators have argued that the EU gave up far more that the US, and in effect capitulated to Washington’s bullying.\nThat is a view shared by most Europeans, judging by the poll, which was published on Tuesday. An average of 75% of respondents said von der Leyen had defended European interests “very” or “fairly” badly.\nAlmost 70% said they would be willing to boycott US goods over the terms of the deal; 44% considered Trump “an enemy of Europe”; 47% felt he had “autocratic tendencies”; and 36% said he “behaves like a dictator”.\nMore than three-quarters of those surveyed said they were very or fairly dissatisfied with the EU’s approach to the Trump administration, with almost 40% saying they felt the bloc should stand up and oppose the whims of the US president.\nDays before von der Leyen is scheduled to deliver her 2025 “state of the union” address, a clear majority of respondents (60%) across the five countries said they would view the commission chief’s resignation “very” or “fairly” favourably.\nIn a clear message to Brussels, although majorities ranging from 85% in Spain to 61% in France felt their country should remain an EU member, 37% said that if the bloc failed to protect its citizens from geopolitical risks, quitting “should be envisaged”."

    "raw_text": "Surrender is always one way to end a war. The capitulation of the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to Donald Trump’s demands for a grossly lopsided trade deal in which most EU goods exported to the US will face far higher tariffs than US products face in the EU is not only humiliating; it also does not prevent a transatlantic trade war.\nIndeed, to paraphrase the Prussian military thinker Carl von Clausewitz, it is merely the pursuit of a trade war by other means. After six months of bullying by Trump, the Europeans have acquiesced to a provisional settlement that penalises their exporters and commits the world’s largest trade bloc to buying hundreds of billions of dollars of US fossil fuels and weapons for the duration of his presidency, rather than risk the blanket 30% tariffs he had threatened from 1 August.\nThis was far from the zero-for-zero tariff deal that the European Commission pitched at the start of the talks. The 15% across-the-board tariff von der Leyen ended up accepting was worse than the 10% rate – similar to the UK’s deal – that Brussels officials thought they had secured only two weeks ago.\nThe deal marks Trump’s second humiliation of his European partners in two months, following a Nato summit at which allies yielded to his demands that they spend 5% of their economic output on defence, with 3.5% on core military expenditure. Both were marked by undignified fawning by European officials to the US president’s outsized ego, and by their unwillingness to challenge or correct even his most blatant falsehoods during excruciating joint media appearances.\nThe commission president declared that the deal creates “certainty in uncertain times” and delivers stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the world’s biggest trading relationship, worth $1.7tn. Yet even that claim seems doubtful, since uncertainty remains around the status of pharmaceuticals, which she insisted were covered by the 15% tariff but Trump said would not be part of the deal.\nVon der Leyen’s statement that this was “the second building block, reaffirming the transatlantic partnership” put a brave face on the fact that it was the second time Trump had wielded threats and bluster to extort protection money from timorous European countries desperate to avoid a complete US disengagement in the face of Russia’s threat to the continent.\nYet aside from the disadvantages that European manufacturers now face in the EU’s biggest export market, it is not clear that the deal will buy an end to transatlantic trade friction, or make Trump take a tougher stance against Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine.\nSunday’s meeting at Trump’s golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, was a display of raw power. As one wag described it, the commission chief’s posture should henceforth be known as “von der Lying Down”.\nThe optics could hardly have been more humiliating for the representative of 450 million Europeans. Von der Leyen had to fly to Scotland and wait until the president and his son had finished their round of golf, then endure his boasts about the magnificence of the gilded Donald J Trump ballroom in which they met.\nShe sat in silence as Trump claimed that only the US was providing emergency food assistance to starving Palestinians in Gaza, although the EU is the one of the biggest providers of humanitarian aid. She did not challenge his narrative on Israel’s months-long prevention of UN food deliveries to displaced people in the war-ravaged region.\nWorse, she felt obliged to parrot Trump’s narrative that EU-US trade was unbalanced and that the objective of the negotiation was to “rebalance” the relationship, without referencing the large US surplus in services trade with Europe. Neither leader mentioned the EU’s digital regulations, which remain a potential landmine in transatlantic relations that could blow up within weeks if the commission slaps fines on US tech giants judged to have breached the Digital Markets Act.\nFar from bringing peace in our time, Sunday’s deal leaves some crucial loose ends that have yet to be worked out, including which tariffs on agriculture the EU drops and whether alcoholic drinks are exempted from tariffs. On steel and aluminium, Trump insisted the 50% US tariff would continue to apply globally, whereas von der Leyen said the two sides would revert to historical quotas at lower tariffs.\nThis was at most a damage-limitation exercise to avoid a bigger immediate hit to European business. “We should not forget where we would have been on 1 August,” the commission chief said in defence of the agreement. “We would have been at 30% and it would have been much more difficult to get down to 15%.” The deal appears to protect the interests of German carmakers better than those of Mediterranean food and drink producers, although von der Leyen said she had made clear that some EU agricultural tariffs would stay.\nWhat would have been the alternative? Some European officials, especially in France, say the EU should have been tougher from the outset, implementing retaliatory measures as soon as higher tariffs clicked under Trump’s “liberation day” announcement in April and invoking its anti-coercion instrument to threaten action against US services companies and investments in Europe.\nBrussels was unable to make stronger use of its trade powers because of divisions among the 27 member states, with Germany, Italy and Ireland urging restraint to protect their economic interests, while France and Spain supported a more robust EU stance. The result was a deal that will undoubtedly hurt the European economy – the Axa Group chief economist Gilles Moec calculates that it could knock 0.5% off the bloc’s GDP – but averted potential tit-for-tat trade measures that could have exacted a higher price.\nEurope must now accelerate the conclusion of trade deals with other partners around the world to mitigate the damage from Trump’s policies. At best, this humiliation could stimulate the EU to build an alliance of like-minded, rules-based trading nations and blocs without the US. But that would take more courage and more unity than the bloc has shown in handling Trump.\n-\nPaul Taylor is a senior visiting fellow at the European Policy Centre\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "-\nRussian president Vladimir Putin has awarded a medal for courage to the overall commander of Russia’s war in Ukraine, who is the subject of an international arrest warrant over alleged crimes against humanity in connection with the invasion of Ukraine. Army general Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces and one of the most powerful men in the Russian military, is credited as the chief architect of Russia’s modern warfare strategy. The US sanctioned him the day after Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, saying he was among those directly responsible, and in June last year the international criminal court (ICC) at The Hague issued an arrest warrant for him – as well as former defence minister Sergei Shoigu – for alleged war crimes in Ukraine. The two are accused of the war crimes of directing attacks at civilian objects and of causing excessive incidental harm to civilians or damage to civilian objects, and are also accused of crimes against humanity. The ICC wrote that there “are reasonable grounds to believe that the two suspects bear responsibility for missile strikes carried out by the Russian armed forces against the Ukrainian electric infrastructure from at least 10 October 2022 until at least 9 March 2023”. Russia, which is not a party to the ICC, has said electrical infrastructure in Ukraine represents a legitimate military target and has denied targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure. Gerasimov turned 70 on Monday. The Order of Courage, a prestigious state decoration, was given to him “for courage, bravery and dedication displayed in the fulfilment of military duty”, according to a decree published on Russia’s official legal acts website late on Monday.\n-\nThe EU’s most senior sanctions envoy is holding talks in Washington with US officials after Donald Trump said he was ready to take further action against Russia over the war in Ukraine. David O’Sullivan, the EU sanctions envoy, was meeting US counterparts on Monday, as Europe and the US look for tougher measures against Moscow’s war machine after Russia launched its largest-ever air attack on Ukraine over the weekend, reports Jennifer Rankin. Ahead of those meetings, the head of the European Council, António Costa, hailed transatlantic cooperation over sanctions against Russia and said it was clear the US remained engaged in supporting Ukraine.\n-\nGermany and France are pushing to target Russian oil giant Lukoil as part of a new round of EU sanctions over the war in Ukraine, diplomats say. In a joint proposal circulated last week, Germany and France suggested blacklisting privately-owned oil major Lukoil and its trading subsidiary Litasco, diplomats said on Monday, speaking anonymously. The two countries were also pressing to target refineries in third countries involved in exporting Russian oil to the EU and trading firms dealing with Russian oil, they said.\n-\nRussia used an Iskander ballistic missile in an attack that damaged a Ukrainian government building in Kyiv at the weekend, a Ukrainian official said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said he discussed Sunday’s attack – the first of its kind in the war – with US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Monday. While visiting the building, the European Union’s ambassador to Ukraine, Katarina Mathernova, noted the “gaping hole” left by the impact and missile remnants and said: “It’s only because the missile was unable to fully detonate that the entire building wasn’t turned into ruins.” The Iskander has been widely used by Russia against other targets in Ukraine.\n-\nThe Russia-installed head of occupied parts of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region claimed late on Monday that Ukrainian forces had launched heavy drone and missile attacks on two cities in the area, killing two people and injuring 16. Denis Pushilin said on Telegram that Ukrainian forces had struck targets in the region’s main city, also called Donetsk, and in Makiivka, an industrial town further north. There was no comment from Ukrainian officials on the attacks. Russian news agencies quoted security officials in the occupied areas as saying at least 20 drones had been deployed in the two assaults and that air defence units were in action.\n-\nEstonia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned the Russian embassy’s charge d’affaires to lodge a protest after a Russian helicopter violated its airspace. The Russian MI-8 aircraft entered the airspace of the country – a Nato member and strong ally of Ukraine – on Sunday near the island of Vaindloo in the Gulf of Finland. Estonian foreign minister Margus Tsahkna said on X it was “the third such incident this year, a serious breach of international law”.\nUkraine war briefing: Putin awards ‘courage’ medal to Russian general sought by ICC over alleged crimes against humanity in Ukraine\nArmy chief of staff Valery Gerasimov is accused of war crimes for directing attacks against civilians and civilian objects in Ukraine under an arrest warrant from the international criminal court.

    "raw_text": "The international criminal court (ICC) at The Hague has issued arrest warrants for Russia’s ex-minister of defence and current army chief of staff for alleged war crimes in Ukraine after a missile campaign targeting Ukrainian power plants and other civilian infrastructure during the full-scale invasion.\nEx-minister of defence Sergei Shoigu and the chief of the general staff of the Russian armed forces, Valery Gerasimov, are accused of the war crimes of directing attacks at civilian objects and of causing excessive incidental harm to civilians or damage to civilian objects. They are also accused of crimes against humanity.\nThe Hague issued warrants for their arrest, but they are unlikely to be able to serve them as the pair are in Russia, which is not a party to the ICC and has denounced the court. Ukraine is not a member of the ICC but has given the court jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes committed on its territory since 2022. Shoigu was removed as the minister of defence last month but has remained a senior government official as the head of Russia’s security council.\nThe court has previously issued warrants for the arrest of Vladimir Putin and Russia’s human rights ombudsman, Maria Lvova-Belova, for their role in the forcible deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia. A number of the children have been adopted by Russian officials or put up for adoption under false identities.\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, said the ICC’s decision to issue the warrants against Shoigu and Gerasimov was “a clear indication that justice for Russian crimes against Ukrainians is inevitable”.\nHe wrote on Telegram: “Every criminal involved in the planning and execution of these strikes must know that justice will be served. And we do hope to see them behind bars.” He added that he looked forward to “more arrest warrants in order to deprive Russia of its sense of impunity”.\nAnnouncing the warrants, the court wrote there “are reasonable grounds to believe that the two suspects bear responsibility for missile strikes carried out by the Russian armed forces against the Ukrainian electric infrastructure from at least 10 October 2022 until at least 9 March 2023. During this timeframe, a large number of strikes against numerous electric power plants and substations were carried out by the Russian armed forces in multiple locations in Ukraine”.\nThe court said it had “reasonable grounds to believe that the suspects intentionally caused great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health, thus bearing criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of other inhumane acts”.\nRussia has argued that electrical infrastructure in Ukraine represents a legitimate military target. The strikes have led to rolling blackouts across Ukraine, and have threatened crucial supplies of heating to the population in winter when temperatures fall below freezing.\nZelenskiy said this month that Russia had damaged or destroyed more than half of Ukraine’s power generation, causing the worst rolling blackouts since the invasion began in 2022.\nIn its statement, the court said it believed the strikes were “directed against civilian objects, and for those installations that may have qualified as military objectives at the relevant time, the expected incidental civilian harm and damage would have been clearly excessive to the anticipated military advantage”."

    "raw_text": "The EU’s most senior sanctions envoy is holding talks in Washington with US officials after Donald Trump said he was ready to take further action against Russia over the war in Ukraine.\nDavid O’Sullivan, the EU sanctions envoy, is meeting US counterparts on Monday, as Europe and the US look for tougher measures to weaken Vladimir Putin’s war machine after Russia launched its largest-ever air attack on Ukraine over the weekend.\nAhead of those meetings, the head of the European Council, António Costa, hailed transatlantic cooperation over sanctions against Russia and said it was clear that the US remained engaged in supporting Ukraine.\nA European Commission spokesperson also confirmed that its president, Ursula von der Leyen, spoke to the US vice-president, JD Vance, over the phone on Friday, and “the only topic during the call was Ukraine”.\nAsked by a reporter at the White House on Sunday if he was ready to move to “the second phase” of sanctions against Russia, Trump responded: “Yeah I am,”without elaborating.\nTrump also said that “certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday individually” and that he would speak to the Russian president soon.\nTrump has previously threatened tougher measures against Putin, but each time has allowed deadlines to pass without action.\nSpeaking in Helsinki on Monday, Costa said the EU and US were “coordinating our efforts to align our sanctions, to be more effective” and to increase pressure on Putin to join peace negotiations with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nHe said the EU needed to increase sanctions on Russia, “but also secondary sanctions” on countries buying gas and oil from Russia.\nThe German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, condemned Russia’s attacks on Ukraine, “which show further escalation”, a German government spokesperson said on Monday. The spokesperson also said Germany would welcome the US joining Europe in pushing for more sanctions against Russia.\nIn a coordinated move, France and Germany have proposed further sanctions targeting Russia’s energy revenues, including listing non-sanctioned oil majors, such as privately owned Lukoil, as well as going after refineries in foreign countries that re-export Russian oil to the EU. The EU’s two key players also propose increasing pressure on Russia’s civilian economy, via measures targeting civil aviation and engineering. “Russia continues its stalling tactics and persists in refusing a ceasefire,” said a Franco-German paper that calls for increased pressure.\nOver the weekend, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, suggested the US and EU could impose tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil. Bessent said the US was preparing to increase pressure on Russia and urged Europe to do more: “We need our European partners to follow us, because if the US and EU can do this together … we are in a race now between how long the Ukrainian military hold up versus how long can the Russian economy hold up.”\nThe Trump administration has imposed 50% tariffs on goods from India in response to its purchases of discounted Russian oil, but declined to take such punitive action against other large buyers of Russian energy, such as China.\nThe issue of secondary sanctions, which would apply penalties to third countries that trade with Russia, could be difficult for the EU, which is racing to sign new trade deals, including with India, by the end of the year to counter Trump’s tariffs that are roiling international relations.\nThe US focus on Russian energy also puts an uncomfortable spotlight on Hungary and Slovakia. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, and the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, favour Trump’s agenda but are also friendly to Putin and have opposed EU plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2028.\nThe US energy secretary, Chris Wright, told the Financial Times that if Europe ceased to buy Russian fossil fuels, that would “absolutely” have a positive influence on the US adopting more aggressive sanctions against Russia. The EU has pledged to buy $750bn of US oil, gas and nuclear products by 2028.\nThe EU has approved 18 rounds of sanctions against Russia since the full-scale invasion of February 2022, with further proposals expected in the coming days.\nThe last set of EU sanctions, agreed in July, lowered the price cap on Russian oil, closed loopholes to reduce trade in Russian petroleum products and banned vessels carrying Russian energy from European ports.\nSpeaking alongside Costa, Finland’s prime minister, Petteri Orpo, said cooperation with the US on sanctions was crucial. The latest attacks on Ukraine showed, he said, “that Putin will not stop killing, he will not go to the negotiation tables. That is why we have to cooperate with and negotiate with the US to find a way to do more sanctions, stronger sanctions, do more military support to Ukraine, and build security arrangements to Ukraine.”\nOn Sunday Russia launched its largest-ever barrage on Ukraine, setting the main government building in Kyiv on fire, and killing at least four people, including a woman and her baby.\nZelenskyy said Putin was testing the world to see “whether they will accept or tolerate this” and he urged Ukraine’s allies to impose more sanctions and “tough tariffs” on Russia.\nThe Kremlin said on Monday that no sanctions would ever force Russia to change course on Ukraine.\nEurope and Ukraine are doing everything they can to draw the US into their orbit, said the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov."

    "raw_text": "-\nAsked by a reporter at the White House on Sunday if he was ready to move to “the second phase” of sanctions targeting Russia, Donald Trump responded: “Yeah, I am.” The US president stopped short of saying he was committed to such a decision or what a second phase might entail. The White House did not immediately respond to an email on Sunday asking what steps Trump was contemplating. Trump said on Sunday night that “certain European leaders are coming over to our country on Monday or Tuesday individually” and he would also speak to Vladimir Putin soon.\n-\nThe US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Sunday that the US and the EU could put “secondary tariffs on the countries that buy Russian oil”, pushing the Russian economy to the brink of collapse and bringing Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. China is a major buyer of Russian energy exports. Trump has placed a 50% tariff on Indian goods – ostensibly because it imports Russian oil, although the US president harbours other grievances involving India, reportedly including its prime minister’s refusal to nominate him for a Nobel peace prize.\n-\nDonald Trump gave Vladimir Putin what he wanted by hosting the Russian president in Alaska, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has told the US network ABC. “And it’s a pity … Putin doesn’t want to meet with me, but he wants very much to meet with the president of the United States, to show everybody video and images that he is there.” The ABC presenter Martha Raddatz put to Zelenskyy “[Putin] said he will meet if you come to Moscow,” to which the Ukrainian president responded scornfully: “He can come to Kyiv,” adding: “I can’t go to Moscow when my country is under missiles, under attacks each day … he understands it.” Putin’s stance was a ploy to postpone their meeting, Zelenskyy said, adding that he was “ready for any kind of meeting – but not in Russia – any kind of meeting, bilateral [only with Putin], trilateral [adding Trump]”.\n-\nSeparately the Ukrainian president said he was counting on a strong US response to the largest ever Russian barrage on Ukraine. A mother and her baby were among the dead, and for the first time a key government building in Kyiv was hit, writes Kate Connolly. “It is important that there is a broad response from partners to this attack today,” said Zelenskyy on Sunday. “We are counting on a strong response from America. That is what is needed.” Trump’s Ukraine war envoy, Keith Kellogg, said on Sunday that the Russian attack “was not a signal that Russia wants to diplomatically end this war”.\n-\nIn other areas of Ukraine, a teenage girl was injured when Russian mortars hit homes in Kupyansk, Kharkiv region, officials said; and a woman was hurt in a drone strike on Sumy city, said the head of the regional administration.\n-\nUkraine’s military said it attacked the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia’s Bryansk region, inflicting “comprehensive fire damage” during an overnight attack on Sunday. It is part of a strategy to target Russia’s energy industry, which is the backbone of its economy and helps fund the war. Recipients of oil from the pipeline include Hungary and Slovakia whose prime ministers are friendly to Vladimir Putin.\n-\nUkraine’s defence ministry said a new meeting of Kyiv’s allies was being planned and air defences and supplies for Kyiv’s deep strikes on Russia would be discussed."

    "raw_text": "Russia has launched its largest ever air attack on Ukraine, hitting a key government building in Kyiv for the first time and killing at least three people, including a mother and her baby, and drawing widespread condemnation, including a fresh threat of further US sanctions.\nThe bombardment of the capital with a large number of drones and missiles injured at least 18 people and set scores of buildings on fire. Explosions were also reported in the cities of Odesa, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kryvyi Rih. Authorities triggered a countrywide air-raid warning at 6.06am local time and later accused Russia of deliberately striking civilian targets.\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called the attack “a deliberate crime and prolongation of the war” when “real diplomacy could have already begun long ago”. He later said he was counting on a “strong response” from the US.\nThe US president, Donald Trump, who met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a summit in Alaska last month, said without elaboration in response to questioning on Sunday that he was ready to move to a second stage of sanctions against Russia over the conflict. Trump has threatened to penalise countries that buy Russia’s oil, but has so far only hit India with so-called secondary sanctions and stepped back from previous warnings of tougher financial action against Moscow.\nThe Ukrainian air force said 805 combat drones were deployed by Moscow, as well as nine Iskander-K cruise missiles and four Iskander-M ballistic missiles. Of these, four cruise missiles and 747 drones were intercepted by Ukrainian forces, authorities said.\nSmoke was seen billowing from the roof of the Kyiv building that houses the offices of Ukraine’s cabinet ministers, as firefighters fought flames pouring out of an upper storey, although it was not immediately clear whether the fire was the result of debris or a direct hit, which would mark an escalation in Russia’s air campaign. Government buildings in the city centre have previously not been targeted by Russia.\n“For the first time, the government building was damaged by an enemy attack, including the roof and upper floors,” said Ukraine’s prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko. “We will restore the buildings, but lost lives cannot be returned.”\nShe urged the world to react to the destruction and said the pressure of sanctions must be increased, especially against Russian oil and gas.\nZelenskyy said he had spoken to his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, after the strike. “We coordinated our diplomatic efforts, next steps, and contacts with partners to ensure an appropriate response,” Zelenskyy said on the Telegram app.\nThe British prime minister, Keir Starmer, condemned Russia’s onslaught. He called the attacks “cowardly” and said they proved that Putin was “not serious about peace”.\nThe US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said before Trump’s comments on sanctions that Washington was prepared to “increase pressure” on Russia, but that Europe must also act. “If the US and the EU can come in to more sanctions, secondary tariffs on the countries that buy Russian oil, the Russian economy will be in full collapse,” he told NBC’s Meet the Press.\nSunday’s attack was the largest Russian drone strike since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, with nine missile hits and 56 drone strikes in 37 locations across Ukraine. Debris from shot-down drones and missiles fell on eight locations.\nKyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said early on Sunday the drone attacks had killed an infant and a young woman, while a pregnant woman was among the five injured who were admitted to hospital.\nLater in the day, it emerged that the mother and her baby had been killed after they were thrown on to the street by a pressure wave caused by a drone explosion in Kyiv, according to the Kyiv Independent.\nKlitschko said an elderly woman had died in a bomb shelter in the Darnytskyi district to the east of the Dnipro River.\nLocals were left stunned by the attacks, emerging from their homes on to the streets in the early hours of Sunday to watch as firefighters fought the blazes and searched buildings for victims with thermal cameras. They reported a large amount of falling debris from damaged buildings, including glass and window blinds.\nIn the western district of Sviatoshynskyi, several floors of a nine-storey residential building were partly destroyed, Klitschko and emergency officials said.\nFalling drone debris set off fires in a 16-storey apartment building and two other buildings, the mayor added.\nSmoke billowed out of apartment buildings, some with floors partly collapsed and facades crumbled, in social media photographs posted by emergency officials.\nRussia was “deliberately and consciously striking civilian targets”, the head of the capital’s military administration, Timur Tkachenko, said on Telegram.\nDozens of explosions also shook Ukraine’s central city of Kremenchuk, cutting power to some areas, its mayor, Vitalii Maletskyi, said on Telegram. Russian strikes on Kryvyi Rih in the same region targeted transport and urban infrastructure, Oleksandr Vilkul, the head of the military administration, said on Telegram, but with no injuries reported.\nIn the southern city of Odesa, civilian infrastructure and residential buildings were damaged, with fires breaking out in several apartment blocks, the regional governor, Oleh Kiper, said on Telegram.\nOne person was killed in an attack on the north-eastern region of Sumy, according to local authorities. An attack on Saturday on the outskirts of the village of Putyvl also resulted in injuries including of a nine-year-old child, the region’s military governor, Oleh Hryhorov, said on Telegram.\nIn Zaporizhzhia in south-eastern Ukraine, at least 15 people were injured in a drone strike, some of whom had to be hospitalised, said Ivan Fedorov, the head of the region’s military administration. He published photos of residential buildings that had been destroyed.\nAccording to Russian sources, a Ukrainian drone strike led to a fire at the Ilsky oil refinery in the Krasnodar region, in the south, which was quickly extinguished, according to a regional administrator. The reports could not be independently verified."

    "raw_text": "EU officials are meeting their US counterparts to discuss what could be the first coordinated transatlantic sanctions against Russia since Donald Trump returned to the White House. The US president, who has previously stepped back from financial threats to Russia, has this week said he is ready to move to a second stage of sanctions. Their form, if they were to come, is however not yet clear.\nWhat sanctions has the west so far agreed against Russia? Since Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv’s western allies have sanctioned more than 2,500 people and entities, including Putin himself, ministers, oligarchs, military commanders, propagandists, state and private companies aiding the war. Soon after the Russian tanks rolled in, western allies froze an estimated $335bn (€300bn) of Russian central bank assets; cut many Russian banks out of the international financial system via a ban on use of the Swift messaging service; froze sales of military equipment or anything that could be repurposed for making war; ended exports of numerous consumer goods and – eventually – banned imports of Russian diamonds.\nThese sanctions followed earlier western restrictive measures after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. They have been followed by separate sanctions (travel bans and asset freezes) against individuals culpable of human rights abuses in Russia, such as the jailors of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\nWhat are the gaps? Measures so far have not proved nearly enough to induce Moscow to stop the war. Russia has vital lifelines via energy sales and middlemen in non-western countries that sell on sanctioned goods. While western countries quickly banned imports of Russian coal – which could be easily replaced – oil and gas proved more problematic, especially for the EU.\nThe EU has banned most Russian oil imports, but granted an exemption to Hungary and Slovakia , and still gets 3% of oil imports from Russia. The bloc gets 13% of gas imports from Russia, compared with 45% in 2021, but has pledged to phase out all Russian fossil fuel imports by 2028 .\nWealthy G7 countries and the EU imposed a price cap on Russian oil , meaning that ships transporting crude oil cannot use western ports or shipping services, such as insurance. In response, Russia has increased sales of discounted oil to China and India, creating a shadow fleet of poorly maintained, unregistered vessels to transport the fuel at prices above the western cap. EU officials have imposed sanctions on 444 shadow fleet vessels, but concede that new boats are appearing constantly, keeping the trade alive.\nMore broadly, plenty of individuals and companies in non-western countries, such as Turkey, the Caucasus and China, have proved willing to help Russia get round sanctions, by acting as a middleman to sell sanctioned goods.\nWhat is the impact of western sanctions? Sanctions have inflicted real pain on the Russian economy, fuelling inflation, eroding the national wealth fund and threatening a long-term decline in living standards. But the economy has not collapsed, nor has the Kremlin halted its aggression against Ukraine. The Russian economy continues to grow, as a result of massive war spending, albeit at lower levels than before. Proponents of sanctions argue they are working, by forcing Russia to make trade-offs and increase costs, reorienting to a war economy at the expense of social welfare.\nThe Stockholm Institute of Transition Economics (Site), which has studied the Russian economy, has also cast doubt on the accuracy of Russia’s official economic data, suggesting the picture is worse than it appears, that inflation and deficits are understated and GDP overstated. In May, Torbjörn Becker, Site director, forecast that by mid-2026 Russia will struggle to sustain the war at the current level. But in the meantime, Russia is escalating its war on Ukraine, as shown by weeks of deadly air attacks.\nWhat has been the Trump effect? Before his re-election last year, many European capitals feared that the return of Donald Trump to the White House could lead to the US lifting its sanctions on Russia overnight, causing damaging cracks in the western alliance against Russia. After failing to end the war in 24 hours, Trump has repeatedly threatened sanctions, as he grows more impatient that his peacemaking efforts are yet to pay off.\nThe US president said in March he was “pissed off” with Putin and threatened to impose sanctions if there was no truce within a month. The deadline passed without action. By July, Trump was “very unhappy” with Putin and threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries buying Russian oil if no ceasefire deal was reached in 50 days – a deadline he later shortened. The deadline came and went with no action taken.\nAfter his Alaska summit, the US imposed 50% tariffs on India , ostensibly for its purchases of Russian oil, but has declined to take the same action on other buyers, such as China. After the latest massive attacks on Ukraine, Trump was asked if he was ready to move to the second phase of sanctions against Russia. “Yeah, I am,” he said, without elaborating.\nWhat will happen now? EU leaders hope Trump will make good on his threats, amid indications of greater cooperation on sanctions against Russia since the departure of Joe Biden. The EU’s sanctions envoy, David O’Sullivan, was meeting US officials in Washington on Monday to discuss actions against Russia. Meanwhile, senior US administration figures have made clear they would like the EU to go further on sanctions, especially in ending purchases of Russian fossil fuels.\nSenior EU and US officials have argued in favour of tougher secondary sanctions, measures against countries that help Russia circumvent sanctions. That could open further transatlantic tensions. Following the US lead on India will be difficult, as Brussels seeks a trade deal with New Delhi. The EU has sanctioned a few Chinese companies, but stopped short of sweeping measures against one of its largest trading partners, as it seeks to carve out an independent stance on China, compared with the US.\nThe EU is expected to propose further ideas for sanctions against Russia in the coming days. But with a US president who has elevated unpredictability to a foreign policy doctrine , nobody knows what Trump will do."

    "raw_text": "The European Union has agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels.\nThe president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a “remarkable achievement”, after tweeting on Monday night that sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, “cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine”.\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the ban “will effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year” because Germany and Poland had committed to renounce deliveries via a pipeline to their territory.\nMichel added that the package also included removing access to Swift payments for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against “individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine”.\nVon der Leyen called the agreement on a sixth sanctions package was “an important step forward” and said the bloc had agreed a “massive investment in renewable energy” in order to compensate for the diversifying away from Russian oil.\nThe EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, later tweeted: “A landmark decision to cripple Putin’s war machine. Our unity is our strength.”\nVolodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. At a summit in Brussels, EU leaders had been attempting to find a way to placate the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has been holding up a deal on the latest sanctions against Putin’s war machine.\nUnder a compromise plan that was discussed at the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo.\nIn a press conference on Monday night, Michel acknowledged talk of a lack of European unity, adding: “I think that more than ever it is important to show that we are able to be strong, that we are able to be firm, that we are able to be tough in order to defend our values and our interests.”\nMichel said the European Council and G7 was also ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid its post-war reconstruction and immediate liquidity needs. However, von der Leyen warned that Ukraine needed €5bn a month just to maintain basic services and “... to give Ukraine a fair chance to rise from the ashes”.\nThe EU had stalled over its latest sanctions against Russia for nearly four weeks since the Von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil by the end of the year.\nArriving at the summit, Orbán said “the pipeline solution is not bad” but insisted his country needed guarantees it could get oil from other sources if there was an “accident” at the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through war-torn Ukraine. In typically pugnacious style, Orbán attacked the commission for what he called its “irresponsible behaviour” and blamed it for creating a “difficult situation”.\nThe bloc has come under increasing criticism for slow progress in agreeing the latest sanctions package, the sixth, including from Zelenskiy, who addressed the gathering on Monday by video link.\nUkraine’s president called on leaders to end their disputes, which “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”, according to an extract of his speech published on Telegram.\nThe German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said earlier he was confident there was a “good solution” on the oil embargo. Germany, along with Poland, has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Officials close to the talks say the decision of these two large economies to forgo oil from the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline means the EU oil embargo would cover 93% of Russian oil supply by the end of the year.\nAs yet there is no end date on the exemption for the southern leg of Druzhba, covering Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil.\nLatvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said he intended to warn his fellow leaders not to get “bogged down” in details. “The big picture is that we have to starve Russia, Moscow, of the funds to continue the war,” he said. “If each European country only thinks about itself then we will never move forward.”\nItaly, the Baltic states, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries that import oil on tankers had initial reservations about an exemption for pipeline oil that would give an advantage to those countries that can continue to import cheaper Russian oil. But there was growing willingness to accept an imbalance on the EU’s internal market to secure agreement on sanctions.\nBeyond sanctions, EU leaders are expected to approve €9bn in emergency support for Ukraine, although there is no decision yet on whether the funds will be low-interest loans or non-repayable grants.\nUkraine will need hundreds of billions to rebuild destroyed schools, hospitals, residential buildings and infrastructure. The European Commission has proposed a jointly managed reconstruction body to be organised by Ukraine and the EU, with contributions from international institutions.\nAs EU talks went on, it emerged Russia would cut off gas supplies to the Netherlands on Tuesday, in the latest escalation of the energy payments row with the west. The Dutch-backed trader GasTerra revealed the move after the company refused to meet the Kremlin’s demand of paying Gazprom in roubles. About 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia.\nSome EU leaders are already talking about a seventh round of Russia sanctions targeting gas. But some argue the EU rushed too quickly into an oil embargo. “We talked about oil, under pressure from [the] Baltics and Poland before having done our homework,” a senior EU diplomat said. “Under the pressure of this war we have maybe taken some steps too soon and we are now facing the consequences.”\nAdditional reporting by Pjotr Sauer"

    "raw_text": "The European Commission has insisted there will be no return to Russian gas, as it published plans to phase out fossil fuel imports from its eastern neighbour by 2028.\nThe EU energy commissioner, Dan Jørgensen, said a proposed ban on Russian gas imports would remain, irrespective of whether there was peace in Ukraine.\nEU officials recalled when Russia cut gas supplies in 2006, 2009 and 2014, as well as the deliberate reduction in flows in 2021 before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which contributed to a huge rise in energy prices and surging inflation across the continent.\nUnder the proposals, European companies would be banned from importing Russian gas or providing services at EU liquified natural gas terminals to Russian customers. Any contracts entered into from today would have to be wound up by 1 January 2026, but companies with pre-existing agreements have a final deadline of 1 January 2028.\nThe proposal is facing a backlash from Hungary, Slovakia and Austria, but these countries are not thought to have enough support to block the plan from becoming EU law.\nJørgensen said plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels were not a response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “This is a ban that we introduce because Russia has weaponised energy against us, because Russia has blackmailed member states in the EU, and therefore they are not a trading partner that can be trusted,” he said. “That also means that, irrespectively of whether there is a peace or not – which we all hope there will be of course – this ban will still stand.”\nEU importers will be required to provide customs officers with detailed information about the source of gas to prevent any attempts to sell Russian imports under a new flag.\nAbout 13% of EU gas imports is expected to come from Russia in 2025, compared with 45% in 2021. While Europe has cut supplies of pipeline gas from Russia, in 2024 it bought record amounts of Russian LNG, raising questions about the EU’s commitment to Ukraine and climate goals.\nThe commission expressed confidence that European companies terminating long-term gas contracts would not be liable for damages. Jørgensen said the EU ban was beyond any individual company’s control. “It is not them who are breaking the contract, it is indeed force majeure.”\nThe EU also wants to end imports of Russian oil by 2028, compared with 3% today and 27% in 2021.\nBut the latest proposal does not remove an exemption from the EU’s oil embargo granted to Hungary and Slovakia. When the EU agreed an oil import embargo in March 2023, the central European countries secured an opt-out that allowed them to continue to be supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline. This carve-out, agreed under the EU’s sanctions regime, cannot be touched by this legislation, which has a different legal basis.\nHungary and Slovakia have sharply criticised the EU plans to phase out fossil fuels. Péter Szíjjártó, the Hungarian foreign minister, claimed Hungarian consumers could pay four times more for utilities, and he posted a video on social media on Monday in which he spoke over a dramatic action movie-style soundtrack. EU officials reject suggestions that prices would go up.\nIn more muted criticism, Austria’s energy ministry told the Financial Times that the EU should be open to resuming gas imports from Russia if there was a deal to end the war in Ukraine.\nHowever, Lena Schilling, an Austrian Green MEP and former Fridays for the Future activist, called the stance shortsighted and morally irresponsible. “Have we learned nothing from bombed hospitals, abducted children and a war of aggression in the heart of Europe?” she asked."

    "raw_text": "The EU executive has called for lowering the price cap on Russian oil as it seeks to tighten energy and financial sanctions against the Kremlin’s ability to wage war.\nThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed that western countries reduce the price at which Russian oil can be sold to $45 (£30) a barrel, down from the current $60.\nThe $60 price cap was agreed through the G7 in December 2022, when oil traded at well over $100 a barrel, with the aim of reducing Russia’s revenues from fossil fuels.\nHowever, experts have said the falling price of oil, which hit a four-year low of $59.77 in April, had rendered the cap “meaningless”. The price of a barrel of Brent crude has since recovered to about $67.\nVon der Leyen told reporters on Tuesday that lowering the cap would “restore its effectiveness”. Oil exports, she added, represented one-third of Russian government revenues. “We need to cut this source of revenues.”\nShe expressed confidence the G7 would adopt the lower oil price cap, despite uncertainty about Donald Trump’s appetite to impose sanctions on Vladimir Putin. G7 leaders, including von der Leyen, are due to discuss the proposal in Canada next week.\nReferring to her recent discussions with the Republican senator Lindsey Graham, von der Leyen said: “We are very much aligned in the aim to urge Russia by those massive sanctions to come to the negotiation table and to be serious about negotiations that lead towards a just and lasting peace … And therefore I am very confident that we will achieve this goal [the $45 price cap].”\nGraham is the author of a bill that he says would impose “bone-breaking sanctions” on Putin including a 500% tariff on goods from countries importing Russian oil.\nAs part of the EU’s proposed 18th round of sanctions against Russia, the commission also wants to tighten up measures against the country’s “shadow fleet”, hundreds of old and poorly maintained tankers that enable the Kremlin to export oil to countries such as India at a price above the western-imposed cap.\nFor the first time Brussels is targeting sanctions against the captain of a shadow fleet tanker, an Indian national, according to an unpublished draft sanctions proposal. Officials hope this will have a chilling effect, discouraging others from crewing the vessels, which fly under a flag of convenience.\nThe commission also proposes listing 70 more shadow fleet vessels on its sanctions list, bringing the total under designation to more than 400. One EU diplomat estimated last month that the fleet now stood at about 800 tankers, up from just 100 two years ago.\nThe EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, claimed sanctions on the shadow fleet were having a marked impact. “When sanctioned, Russia’s shadow fleet tankers cannot dock in ports and Russia has to find new vessels. This costs some more and runs down their profits.”\nAfter the EU adopted the last round of sanctions in May, which included banning a further 189 shadow fleet vessels from EU ports and accessing services, such as insurance, Kallas said Russia’s oil revenues exports via the Black Sea and Baltic Sea routes had declined by 30% in a week.\nAs previously trailed by von der Leyen, the EU executive also wants to impose restrictions on doing business with the companies involved in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines.\nNord Stream 1 was rendered unusable after a series of underwater blasts for which no one has ever claimed responsibility; Nord Stream 2 never received a licence. However, Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. EU officials say the measure is necessary to dissuade investors from going back to business as usual.\nThe latest proposals, which would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU’s 27 member states, would also impose restrictions on doing business with 22 banks, cutting them off from the Swift financial messaging system.\nEuropean leaders last month vowed to impose “massive” sanctions on Russia if Putin did not agree to a 30-day ceasefire within days. “We are ramping up pressure on Russia because strength is the only language that Russia will understand,” von der Leyen said."

    "raw_text": "Donald Trump has said he is “pissed off” with Vladimir Putin over his approach to a ceasefire in Ukraine and threatened to levy tariffs on Moscow’s oil exports if the Russian leader does not agree to a truce within a month.\nThe US president indicated he would levy a 25% or 50% tariff that would affect countries buying Russian oil in a telephone interview with NBC News, during which he also threatened to bomb Iran and did not rule out using force in Greenland.\n“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, which it might not be, but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said.\n“That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States. There will be a 25% tariff on all … on all oil, a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil.”\nThe abrupt change of direction came after Putin had tried to attack the legitimacy of Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday, Trump said. Appearing on Russian television, Putin had suggested Ukraine could be placed under a temporary UN-led government to organise fresh elections before negotiating a peace deal.\nTrump has previously called the Ukrainian president a dictator, but on Sunday he said: “I was very angry, pissed off” when Putin “started getting into Zelenskyy’s credibility, because that’s not going in the right location, you understand?”\nHe said “new leadership means you’re not gonna have a deal for a long time, right” and that he wanted to exert pressure on the Kremlin, which has thrown up a string of questions about a peace settlement and only agreed to limited maritime and energy ceasefires so far.\nTrump repeated that “if a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, I’m going to put secondary sanctions on Russia”, but then indicated he would quickly back down if there was progress on a ceasefire.\n“The anger dissipates quickly” if Putin “does the right thing”, Trump said, adding that he expected to talk to his Russian counterpart this week.\nLater, speaking to a group of journalists, Trump pointed to similar tariffs imposed on Venezuela, which he said “had a very strong impact”.\n“You know that every ship just got out and they left. A lot of them left. They dropped the hoses right into the ocean and they left,” he said.\nAsked by the Guardian if his relationship with Putin had fallen to its lowest point, Trump responded: “No, I don’t think so, I don’t think he’s going to go back on his word … I was disappointed in a certain way. Some of the things that he said over the last day or two having to do with Zelenskyy … he’s supposed to be making a deal with him, whether you like him or you don’t like him. So I wasn’t happy with that.”\nThe US president also used the earlier NBC interview to tell Iran that if “they don’t make a deal” to curb their nuclear weapons programme, “there will be bombing. It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before”. Officials from both countries were engaged in negotiations, he added.\nHe also mentioned fresh economic sanctions as an alternative. “There’s a chance that, if they don’t make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them,” Trump said. “I am considering putting on secondary tariffs on Iran until such time as a deal is signed.”\nSecondary tariffs are a novel idea. The US introduced a 25% tariff last week on countries that buy crude oil and liquid fuels from Venezuela, the largest of which is China, after Trump accused the Latin American country of sending criminals and gang members into the US under the cover of migrants.\nRussian oil exports are already subject to a range of sanctions from the US, UK, EU and other G7 countries, leaving China and India as the two largest buyers, according to the International Energy Agency. What is not yet clear is whether the measures proposed would be effective once they come into force.\nFinland indicated it may have had a role in Trump’s intervention. A day before the interview, Trump spent time with his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The two men had breakfast and lunch and played a round of golf on an unofficial visit, Stubb’s office said.\n“My message in the conversations I have with the president is that we need a ceasefire, and we need a deadline for the ceasefire, and then we need to pay a price for breaking a ceasefire,” Stubb told the Guardian.\n“So, number one, we need a ceasefire date, and I would prefer that to be Easter, say, 20 April, when President Trump has been in office for three months. If by then it’s not accepted or is broken by Russia, there needs to be consequences. And those consequences should be sanctions, maximum sanctions, and we continue the pressure up until the 20th and then we’ll see what happens.”\nDuring a previous interview with NBC on Saturday, Trump said: “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%” and argued that while there’s a “good possibility that we could do it without military force … I don’t take anything off the table.”\nDuring the election campaign, Trump had said that he could end the Ukraine war within 24 hours, comments he more recently claimed were “a little bit sarcastic”. That has proved elusive and his tactics to force Russia and Ukraine into agreeing a ceasefire have so far been focused on bullying and pressurising Kyiv.\nTrump and his vice-president, JD Vance, berated Zelenskyy at the Oval Office a month ago, which was followed by Washington cutting off intelligence and military aid. Kyiv then signed up to the principle of a 30-day ceasefire if the Kremlin would reciprocate in return for intelligence and aid being restored.\nPutin said earlier this month that although he was in favour of a ceasefire, “there are nuances” and any halt in fighting should “remove the root causes of this crisis”, a sweeping but vague demand.\nThe Russian president and his allies have called for the demilitarisation of Ukraine, insisted that the presence of western troops as peacekeepers would be unacceptable and demanded the full annexation of four regions, three of which it only partially occupies.\nTwo people were killed and 25 were injured in and around Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, in Russian attacks on Saturday night and Sunday morning. A military hospital was among the buildings struck. Ukraine’s general staff denounced what it said was a “deliberate, targeted shelling”, a rare acknowledgement of military casualties.\nTrump also claimed to journalists on Sunday that Ukraine’s president was trying to back out of the minerals deal.\n“And if he does that he’s got some problems. Big, big problems. We made a deal on rare earth and now he’s saying, well, you know, I want to renegotiate the deal,” Trump said. “He wants to be a member of Nato. Well, he was never going to be a member of Nato. He understands that. So if he’s looking to renegotiate the deal, he’s got big problems.”\nZelenskyy last week told reporters the US was “constantly” changing the terms of a proposed minerals deal, but he did not want Washington to think he was against it.\nTrump’s interventions follow a difficult week for the White House, during which senior administration officials were criticised for discussing attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen on the Signal messaging app, which is not authorised by the Pentagon.\nThe highly sensitive discussion, which included bombing plans, leaked because a journalist from the Atlantic magazine was mistakenly added to the chat by the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz."

    "raw_text": "What might the impact be on India’s economy? Washington added an extra 25% duty on top of the 25% imposed earlier this month, citing India’s refusal to stop buying Russian crude and defence hardware.\nThe duties, which are 16 percentage points higher than China, 31 points higher than most south-east Asian countries and 35 points above South Korea, have pushed US tariffs on Indian goods to levels that the investment house Nomura likened to a “trade embargo”.\nThe US is India’s largest export market, worth $86.5bn (£64.1bn) a year. Around two-thirds of shipments are covered by the 50% tariff, threatening jobs and growth across sectors reliant on US demand.\n“No Indian product can stand any competitive edge under such heavy import taxes,” said Garima Kapoor of Elara Securities. Economists say the tariffs could erase up to one percentage point from India’s GDP growth this fiscal year.\nUnemployment is a worry. India’s overall jobless rate stood at 5.6% in June, rising to 7.1% in cities. A major drop in US exports could hit millions of workers, economists say.\nWhere will the biggest impact be felt? India’s giant generic pharmaceuticals sector and its electronics and petroleum products are exempt from the tariffs. Aluminium, steel and copper remain at 25%, but job-heavy sectors such as textiles, jewellery, seafood and leather are squarely in the line of fire.\nExports from affected sectors could plunge 70%, from $60.2bn to $18.6bn, while overall shipments to the US could fall by 43%, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative, a Delhi-based thinktank .\nCompanies rushed shipments ahead of the 27 August cut-off. With the tariff wall now up, exporters must either swallow costs, which will be impossible for many, or cede market share to countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico.\nIndia’s $179bn textiles industry includes $37.7bn in exports, with the US buying nearly $10.3bn. Mithileshwar Thakur, of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said Indian exporters now faced a 30% cost disadvantage compared with Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia. “This is an earthquake,” said Kirit Bhansali, chair of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.\nEven if tariffs are lowered later, competitors may have already locked in US market share. “Competitors like China, Vietnam, Mexico, Turkey, and even Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala and Kenya stand to gain, potentially locking India out of key markets even after tariffs are rolled back,” Srivastava said.\nCan India wean itself off Russian oil? India, the world’s third-largest oil consumer and top buyer of Russian seaborne crude, could wean itself off Russian oil over time. But right now it views Russia as an all-weather friend – a vital defence and energy ally amid the trade turmoil that Trump has unleashed. Russia supplies about 40% of India’s oil needs, up from less than 1% before the Ukraine war. Even though discounts on Russian crude have narrowed from $20–$25 below benchmark Brent crude in 2022 to about $2.50 a barrel now, India continues buying because it secures energy reliably and relatively cheaply.\nA sudden reduction could also leave India vulnerable to global price swings. It will continue buying oil from wherever it gets the best deal and take measures to protect its national interest from US tariffs, India’s ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, told TASS at the weekend. He also said India was able to pay for Russian oil in rupees, which meant it didn’t have to use its US currency reserves. “Now, we have a working system of trade settlement in national currencies. There is no problem now in payment for oil imports,” he said.\nIndian firms are calculated to have saved $17bn by buying cheaper Russian oil since the start of the war in Ukraine, but that could be dwarfed by the impact of tariffs on exporters, which could cut India’s US exports by nearly $37bn this financial year, said Srivastava.\nWhat is India doing to mitigate the impact? Narendra Modi’s government has urged Indians to buy domestically made goods. “I appeal to the citizens of our country to prioritise purchasing goods that are made in India,” the prime minister said this week. The government also plans to shake up the nationwide goods and services tax, cutting most rates to 5% or 18% to boost spending.\nEssentials such as food, textiles and cement will become cheaper, while luxury goods remain pricey. The government is reportedly assembling a multibillion-dollar package to free up cash for exporters.\nIndia has been seeking to diversify its markets and recently signed a free trade deal with the UK. But exporters say much more is needed. The Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) has called for a state-supported one-year moratorium on repaying the principal and interest on loans to free up cash for diversifying markets. “We are staring at a crisis which will force shutdowns and cause unemployment,” said the FIEO’s president, SC Ralha. The AEPC has appealed for interest relief to counter high borrowing costs of between 8% and 12%, compared with 3% in China and Malaysia.\nIndia is also cautiously warming up to Chinese investment as part of a strategic pivot in response to escalating US tariffs. Modi is making his first visit to China since relations went into a deep freeze following a brutal clash along their disputed border in 2020 to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.\nHe said this week the world was living through an era of “economic selfishness” in which countries pursue their own interests first. “No matter how high the pressure, India will continue to build its strength to withstand it,” he added. “India is ready to pay a very heavy price to protect its interests.”"

    "raw_text": "After taking six months to conclude that Vladimir Putin may not be a kindred transactional authoritarian leader but an ideological nationalist seeking the return of what “belongs to Russia”, the deadline Donald Trump set for the Russian president to agree a Ukraine ceasefire or face US sanctions on oil exports arrives on Friday.\nWhat Trump – who some had claimed was a Russian asset – does next to punish Putin could define his presidency.\nIt is a remarkable turnaround and one that seasoned Trump watchers such as Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, said they had never expected. Only months ago the debate was about what further inducements Trump would offer Putin to end the fighting. His administration has not introduced any sanctions against Russia, compared with at least 16 sets of actions in every prior six months back to February 2022, according to a report submitted to the Senate banking committee by top Democrats this week.\nTrump first set Putin a 50-day deadline then cut weeks off it. “Secondary sanctions and tariffs against China, India and Brazil, which buy Russian oil, are the obvious next step in an attempt to stop the conflict,” the US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, predicted on Tuesday.\nBut as the deadline approaches, there is lingering scepticism about how far Trump will go. He has dispatched his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to Moscow for the fifth time for last-minute talks and on Friday Trump admitted he did not think sanctions would have much impact as Russians are “wily characters and pretty good at avoiding sanctions”.\nHe has also given himself maximum room for political manoeuvre by ensuring the US Senate did not pass legislation before its summer recess that would have empowered him to slap bone-crushing 500% tariffs on exports from countries that import Russian oil, principally India, China, Brazil and Turkey.\nTrump had argued that the congressional legislation was unnecessary as he can act through executive orders, mentioning instead 100% tariffs on economies that import Russian oil – a whopping number, even if lower than the 500% floated by the Republican senator Lindsey Graham.\nIt is striking that in the run-up to Witkoff’s talks in Moscow that Trump, normally keen to tout his leverage before a negotiation, has given only sketchy detail of the punishments the importers of Russian energy may face, either in terms of US sanctions on foreign refineries importing Russian oil or US tariffs on countries importing Russian oil.\nSome of Trump’s warnings this week to the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, that he would raise tariffs on India because its government did not care “how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine” do not yet seem to fit into a wider strategy. The tensions appears as much about Trump’s previous complaints with India’s trade practices as its purchases of cheap Russian oil. They are due to start on August 27.\nRachel Ziemba, an adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for a New American Century, said if India was to receive a penalty but China – the largest buyer of most Russian crude – did not, the Russian oil trade may just go further underground. Some of Trump’s advisers, notably the Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, warned China last week of tariff hikes related to Russia energy purchases, but it is hard to see such threats as credible given Trump’s eagerness for a trade deal with China and the risks associated with a sudden stop to trade between China and the US. In 2024 China accounted for 32% of Russian petroleum and oil exports.\nMcFaul told Foreign Policy magazine about a possible boomerang effect if generalised increases in tariffs turn into a full trade war.\nTrump has wavered about the impact of economic pressure on Putin. Many academics say that sanctions on oil reshape economic relationships and change markets rather than produce changes in state behaviour.\nThree years of sanctions on Russia have so far been – at best – a slow burn. Russia chalked up economic growth of 4% in 2023 and 2024, kept unemployment to an astonishing 2%, and even reduced social inequality by sustaining real wage growth that has disproportionately benefited Russians at the lower end of the economic ladder, a recent report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based thinktank, found. The authors predicted that Russia’s economy can withstand the current level of sanctions for at least three more years.\nBut the report also pointed to developing vulnerabilities in Russia. Interest rates are at 18%, inflation stubbornly high and growth is stalling. Russia has had to rework its 2025 budget as oil revenues slipped, largely because of a fall in prices and the discounts importers such as India could demand. As a result, government revenues from Russian oil and gas in May-June were 35% lower than the same period in 2024, the Kyiv School of Economics said in its July review. Russian oil export revenue is projected to drop 16% from $189bn (£142bn) in 2024 to $163bn in 2025 and $151bn in 2026.\nThe federal budget deficit reached 3.7tn rubles ($40.4bn) in the first half of 2025 – 97% of the full-year target of 3.8tn rubles. This is more than five times larger than the deficit in the first half of 2024 and 57% higher than the largest first six-month deficit in recent years (2023). Oil prices are unlikely to recover significantly, meaning Russia will miss its budget target by a wide margin, increasing reliance on its national welfare fund (NWF) and domestic debt issuance.\nThe NWF’s liquid assets are also under pressure, with Russia expected to draw heavily on these reserves by year end. In a report this week, Oxford Economics predicted that Russia “may tip into recession”.\nThe overall reason is simple: the level of military spending, including the cost of voluntary recruitment is distorting the economy. The economist Janis Kluge, who conducts research on Russia at the Berlin thinktank SWP, thinks overall Russian military spending is 8 to 10% of GDP once all expenditure including regional recruitment is included.\nThe pressure could grow. The EU’s most recent sanctions package included a ban from next January on buying oil products made from Russian crude. The package for the first time put sanctions on a big Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, causing Microsoft this week to suspend software services. Other refineries could be placed under sanction – with the UK likely following suit – but the question then arises as to how the supply gap created by the loss of Russian oil can be filled.\nMoreover, if Trump is joining sanctions, the US and Europe will have to come to a joint decision on the continuing value of the elaborate oil price cap, a Biden-era device designed to squeeze Russian oil profits while keeping the global price of oil low.\nThe cap was introduced across the G7 in December 2022 and operates by withdrawing insurance from any shipping company that has not obtained a certificate that it is selling Russian oil below $60 a barrel, but a multitude of problems have arisen.\nIn recent months, as the price of oil has fallen, it’s become evident the $60 cap was set too high. The cap has also led to the birth of a shadow fleet of oil tankers operating without formal insurance that are now being sanctioned by the EU, the US and the UK. The UK and the EU have agreed to lower the price cap from 2 September to $47.60 a barrel, but Trump is keeping the US cap at $60 a barrel, a recipe for circumvention.\nThe one prerequisite is that Trump must not back off, McFaul said. “Making threats and not carrying through with them is one of the biggest mistakes you can make in diplomacy.” The former ambassador recalled George Shultz, the great Reagan-era US secretary of state, saying “never point a gun at anyone unless you are prepared to shoot”."

    "raw_text": "The UK has exposed 18 Russian spies and their units responsible for cyber-attacks in Britain and hacking one of the victims of the Salisbury poisonings, David Lammy, the foreign secretary, has said.\nAnnouncing individual sanctions, Lammy said Russia had targeted media, telecoms providers, political and democratic institutions and energy infrastructure in the UK in recent years.\nHe also said two of the spies had been involved in planting X-Agent spyware on a device used by Yulia Skripal, the daughter of the former spy Sergei Skripal, five years before they were poisoned with novichok in Salisbury in 2018.\nThe Skripals survived the attack on British soil but a woman, Dawn Sturgess, was killed after her boyfriend stumbled across the poison in a perfume bottle.\nX-Agent is believed to be linked to the hacking group Fancy Bear, which has ties to Russia’s GRU military intelligence unit 26165, which is being hit with sanctions.\nThe government said some of the agents from the unit were also involved in targeting the bombing of the Mariupol theatre in Ukraine, where hundreds of civilians, including children, were killed, and carrying out wider cyber-operations in support of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin.\nLammy said the UK was exposing Russian spies and hackers to increase security.\n“GRU spies are running a campaign to destabilise Europe, undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty and threaten the safety of British citizens,” he said.\n“The Kremlin should be in no doubt. We see what they are trying to do in the shadows and we won’t tolerate it. That’s why we’re taking decisive action with sanctions against Russian spies.\n“Putin’s hybrid threats and aggression will never break our resolve. The UK and our allies’ support for Ukraine and Europe’s security is ironclad.”\nThe names of the alleged spies were published online. Sanctions typically involve asset freezes and travel bans.\nThe government said it was also imposing sanctions on an entity called African Initiative that it said was responsible for printing disinformation about health in west Africa.\nThe decision to target spies with sanctions is an escalation of the UK’s strategy, which has previously focused more on politicians, financial institutions and military leaders.\nThe UK announced in May that further sanctions would target dozens of entities “supporting Russia’s military machine, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund Putin’s invasion of Ukraine”.\nThe Foreign Office said at the time: “Putin has so far not put in place the full, unconditional ceasefire that President Trump has called for, and which President Zelenskyy endorsed over two months ago.”\nThe Foreign Office estimated in June that sanctions against Russia had deprived the Russian state of at least $450bn (£340bn) in war funds between February 2022 and June 2025.\nSince taking office last year, Lammy has deployed a tough stance against Russia, saying the post-cold war era is “well and truly over” and arguing that keeping the British people safe means standing up against “Putin’s mafia state”."

    "raw_text": "The EU and the UK have agreed to lower the price cap on Russian oil in a move to further clamp down on the Kremlin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine.\nThe EU has agreed to lower the cap on seaborne oil exports to $47.60 from $60 a barrel as part of what its foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called “one of [the] strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date”.\nThe package includes restrictions on Russian pipelines and banks, as well as tech exports to the country.\nKallas said: “We are putting more pressure on Russia’s military industry, Chinese banks that enables sanctions evasion, and blocking tech exports used in drones.”\nThe EU said it will ensure the moving cap is always 15% lower than the average market price for Urals crude, the main Russian export blend. EU member states bought an estimated €21.9bn (£18.1bn) of Russian oil and gas in 2024.\nThe new cap will apply from 3 September, meaning that companies – insurance brokers and shippers inside the EU and the UK – cannot act to facilitate sales above the cap.\nThe EU’s European affairs ministers applauded at a meeting in Brussels when the latest sanctions against Russia were finally agreed on Friday, after Slovakia gave up its veto. The central European country had been blocking the measures because it objected to EU plans to phase out Russian fossil fuels.\nThe UK announced soon after that it was joining the new lower cap. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is attending a meeting of G20 finance ministers in South Africa, said: “The UK and its EU allies are turning the screw on the Kremlin’s war chest by stemming the most valuable funding stream of its illegal war in Ukraine even further.\n“This decisive step to lower the crude oil price cap will target Russia’s oil revenues and ramp up the pressure on Putin by exploiting his biggest vulnerability – while keeping energy markets stable.”\nThe UK government said it is “taking decisive action to cut off Putin’s oil supply pipeline” and that it has so far sanctioned more than 250 ships responsible for transporting Russian energy supplies.\nThe original cap was introduced in December 2022 by the G7 group of countries, but Donald Trump’s government is not willing to sign up.\nThe EU has also introduced a ban on investing in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines.\nNord Stream 1 was rendered unusable in September 2022 after a series of underwater blasts for which no one has claimed responsibility.\nNord Stream 2 never received a licence. However, Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. The pipelines were added to the sanctions list to dissuade European investors from returning to the projects.\nThe EU also imposed new measures targeting Russia’s shadow fleet – poorly maintained tankers that enable the country to sell oil to countries such as India in defiance of western restrictions. After the G7 and EU introduced the original price cap, European shipping companies sold dozens of old vessels that could be re-registered abroad.\nAs part of the latest sanctions package, a further 105 vessels were banned from accessing EU ports and services, such as insurance, in an attempt to stop the trade, bringing the total of sanctioned vessels to 447.\nUkraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, welcomed the measures as “essential and timely, especially now, as a response to the fact that Russia has intensified the brutality of the strikes on our cities and villages”.\nReuters reported Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying: “We have repeatedly said that we consider such unilateral restrictions illegal, we oppose them.\n“But at the same time, of course, we have already acquired a certain immunity from sanctions, we have adapted to life under sanctions.”"

    "raw_text": "The UK and Europe have announced major sanctions against Russia as it became clear that Monday’s call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin had failed to deliver any meaningful concessions from Moscow.\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Tuesday accused Russia of “trying to buy time in order to continue its war and occupation” as Putin declined to support the US-proposed 30-day unconditional ceasefire already agreed to by Ukraine.\nThe UK said its sanctions would target dozens of entities “supporting Russia’s military machine, energy exports and information war, as well as financial institutions helping to fund Putin’s invasion of Ukraine”.\n“Putin has so far not put in place the full, unconditional ceasefire that President Trump has called for, and which President Zelenskyy endorsed over two months ago,” the Foreign Office said.\nShortly afterwards the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the EU had approved sanctions targeting Russia’s shadow fleet of about 200 vessels and that more sanctions were in the pipeline. “The longer Russia wages war, the tougher our response,” she said.\nWestern countries imposed an embargo on Russia’s oil industry after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and banned services for ships transporting Russian crude. In response, Moscow began relying on a so-called shadow fleet - tankers with murky ownership and often without proper insurance - to continue exports\nZelenskyy on Tuesday welcomed the EU sanctions. “It is important to severely restrict the Russian tanker fleet, which serves to finance killings, as well as all schemes that Russia uses to build up its military industry,” he wrote on his social media channels.\nZelenskyy also said Ukraine had no doubt the war “must end at the negotiating table” but added that there must be clear and realistic proposals on the table and called for more pressure on Russia.\n“We are working with partners to put pressure on the Russians to behave differently. Sanctions matter, and I am grateful to everyone who makes them more tangible for the perpetrators of the war,” he said.\nTrump had indicated on Monday following his call with Putin that the US was not ready to join European sanctions efforts.\nResponding to the new sanctions, Russia’s foreign ministry accused Europe of trying to prevent the resumption of direct dialogue, adding: “Russia never responds to ultimatums.”\nThe announcement of the new sanctions underlined the failure of Trump’s attempted mediation in the war, as it became clear in Kyiv and other European capitals that Trump had in effect accepted Putin’s defiance of calls for an immediate ceasefire.\nInstead, Trump placed the onus on Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate between themselves, perhaps under the auspices of papal mediation. Trump was at pains on Monday to emphasise the “excellent” call he had with Putin, suggesting that talks between the two sides would begin “immediately”, but it quickly became clear that he had backed away from any demand that Russia declare an immediate ceasefire.\nDescribing future talks, Trump said: “The conditions will be negotiated between the two parties, as it can only be, because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of.”\nTrump’s comments appeared to reflect a waning enthusiasm for engagement with attempts to end the war in Ukraine, after comments from the White House that he was “weary and frustrated”, and he again threatened that he was “just going to back away” after the call with Putin. Trump appeared to again defer to Moscow by backing Putin’s call for negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.\nAccording to a report on the Axios website, European leaders – including the leaders of Germany, France, Italy, Finland and the European Commission – who joined a subsequent call with Zelenskyy were “surprised” by Trump’s depiction of his conversation with Putin. It reported that according to its sources “Trump seemed relatively content with what he heard from Putin, and presented it as a new development, even though the Russian leader did not seem to have changed his position at all.”\nRussia has continued to insist both before and after the call that agreements on its long-held and maximalist demands are a precondition for a possible temporary ceasefire.\nThat was underlined by the remarks of the Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, that there was “no timeline” for preparing a memorandum for future talks. “It’s clear that everyone wants to do this as quickly as possible, but of course the devil is in the details,” he told reporters after the call.\nOn Tuesday, Russia appeared to put up yet another hurdle, saying that having suggested working on a memorandum to end the war it was up to Ukraine to cooperate with the peace accord Moscow was proposing.\nAt a press briefing on Monday night, Zelenskyy confirmed reports from last week’s inconclusive talks in Istanbul between the two sides that Russia was demanding that Ukraine withdraw its forces from five regions, including territory not occupied by Russia.\n“It’s our land, we won’t withdraw our troops from our territory … it means that they don’t want peace … if they demand what they know we won’t agree to,” Zelenskyy said.\nThe inconclusive outcome of the call underlined growing concern among senior officials in Kyiv that the US has been consistently out-gamed by Putin with his clear vision of his objectives, not least since Trump took office.\nTrump’s failure to put pressure on Putin has confirmed the fears of officials in Kyiv that Trump is more interested in future business deals with Russia than using US influence to secure a quick ceasefire.\nWith the US at best semi-detached, Ukraine is focusing its efforts on persuading Europe to match its rhetoric against Moscow with more sanctions and military aid."

    "raw_text": "Gen Keith Kellogg, Donald Trump’s somewhat estranged special envoy on Ukraine, is said by some US diplomats to like to joke that the president did indeed say he would solve the Ukraine crisis in 24 hours, he just never specified which 24 hours.\nDark humour may be all that is left to Europeans as they absorb not just Trump’s refusal to impose the promised “bone-crushing sanctions” over Russia’s rejection of a 30-day ceasefire but also the increasing signs that the administration will wash its hands of Ukraine and instead focus on forging a new economic partnership with Russia.\nThe mood among the European leaders who heard Trump’s description of his two-hour phone call with Vladimir Putin on Monday – a call that brought a ceasefire no closer – was said to range from despondent to apoplectic. Accounts vary of whether Trump told the European leaders that Putin did not want peace, or simply that Putin thought he was winning. Either way, no sanctions were imposed.\nYet, only 24 hours before, Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president and sometime Trump golf partner, had spoken optimistically of Trump losing patience with Putin’s prevarications and of the possibility that the US Senate would start the process this week of imposing sanctions drawn up by the president’s close ally Lindsey Graham that would penalise countries that buy Russian oil. The seven hours Stubb had spent in March on Trump’s golf team nursing a tournament victory seemed to have been to no avail.\nTrump blamed big egos and said the conditions for a deal could only be agreed by the warring parties, “because they know details of a negotiation that nobody else would be aware of”. He said he still thought “something might happen, and if it doesn’t happen I’ll simply step aside and they’ll have to move on”. He continued: “Once again, this was a European matter and it should have remained a European matter.” The vice-president, JD Vance, simply said: “This is not our war.”\nBut days before, Kellogg had referred to a 20-point US peace plan starting with a ceasefire that had been shared with the Europeans, completely contradicting Trump’s claim that only the warring parties could have a view on Ukraine’s future.\nThe episode raises what is now the holy grail of modern diplomacy: how best to influence the US president’s thinking, whether it is over Ukraine, Gaza, Iran or China.\nA former US diplomat close to the Ukraine talks urged Europeans to be patient with Trump. “He has gut instincts, those instincts are OK, they are not always wrong, he zigzags, and in the case of Ukraine he is most governed by the tactics he needs to get a ceasefire,” the former diplomat said.\n“He is quite aware and not naive in this. He knows the only reason there is not a ceasefire is because Vladimir Putin wants to wage war. So he knows his target is to pull Putin in tactically. He is dangling rewards – the G8, resource deals, lifting sanctions, summit meetings.\n“Putin does not want to do this. He has no interest in a ceasefire. He has an interest in eliminating Ukrainian national identity and taking it over. He is playing this out deliberately. He is playing games. He is moving the goalposts almost every day and trying to get everyone to follow him … Trump has continuously made excuses for him, but in the hope he can pull him in.”\nThe former diplomat said Trump had four basic objectives in Ukraine. “Trump genuinely wants a ceasefire and the killing to stop. He wants reciprocity so he will be able to tell the US taxpayer ‘you are not throwing your money away on Ukraine’. He wants to deter Putin from doing it again, but he wants Europe to take the lead in preventing him attacking again. I find that acceptable.\n“The US and Ukraine are more in alignment on the ceasefire than they have been at any point since Trump took office. Trump has said on several occasions he will not throw Ukraine under the bus as an independent state.”\nThat judgment was confirmed by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who told a Senate hearing this week: “Russia wants what they do not currently have and are not entitled to, and Ukraine wants what they cannot regain militarily. And that’s been the crux of the challenge.”\nAs to the possibility of Trump fulfilling his threat first made in March to hit Russia with punishing sanctions, the Europeans have few options but to wait. They have invested heavily in Graham, a South Carolina Republican senator and someone to whom Stubb talks most days. Graham spoke this week to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.\nThe former US diplomat said: “Congress cannot force Trump to do anything, but they can be in a position to say we can pass legislation on sanctions to strengthen Trump’s position. The Republicans on the Hill are not portraying this as an alternative to Trump but saying ‘this is how we support his strategy’.”\nAs such, the 80 senators who support Graham’s bill imposing tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil must also wait for Trump’s green light. Of course, that light may never turn green. Rubio told the Senate foreign relations committee: “If you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking.”\nMoreover, Russian accounts of the two-hour call between Putin and Trump dwell on its warm personal nature and Trump’s praise for Russian sacrifice in the second world war. In return, Putin offered to pen a memorandum on a possible peace accord. No deadlines were agreed.\nAs a result, Europe’s nightmare – Trump walking away from Ukraine – draws nearer. But there are many ways to walk away. Would he turn off the intelligence, unilaterally lift sanctions on Russia and block even lend-lease agreements that would allow Ukraine to buy US weaponry? In the slow transition to Europe taking the lead in supporting Ukraine, Trump can cooperate or be disruptive. “It can be a managed process or chaotic and fractious,” said Jack Watling, of the defence thinktank Rusi.\nThe new US ambassador to Nato, Matthew Whitaker, told the Lennart Meri conference in Tallinn – an annual gathering of diplomats and security experts – that after the Nato summit in June the US would lay out plans for troop withdrawal from Europe. Although Whitaker told his audience the withdrawals would be done in an orderly way, not everyone was reassured. Bruno Tertrais, an associate expert at the Institut Montaigne, said: “The words ‘Trump’ and ‘orderly’ in the same sentence do not inspire confidence.”\nSome reduction in the 100,000 US troops in Europe is manageable for the continent, given the Biden administration surged roughly 20,000 troops after the Ukraine invasion, but the scale and method of the withdrawal matters.\nAnd it is hard for the Nato summit to agree a new set of capability targets if the scale of US withdrawals will not be known until the autumn. “Nato decisions on capabilities will be made without knowing the future US force posture in Europe,” said Torrey Taussig, of the Atlantic Council. “These decisions about capability targets for meeting Europe’s own defences and a ceasefire force in Ukraine are near-term decisions, yet we do not know what America’s contribution to Europe will look like.”\nThe sense of frustration is deepened because the European Nato members feel they have agreed a fiscally demanding package on defence spending in time for the Nato summit that addresses all Trump’s complaints about freeloading. Nato states will adopt a new target over the next five to seven years of reaching 3.5% of GDP spent on hard defence and 1.5% on cybersecurity and defence-related infrastructure investment such as roads and bridges to improve troop mobility. (The aim is for the hard defence component to rise annually by 0.2%.)\nThat might be enough to get Europe over the hump of the Nato summit without Trump exploding but it does not deal with the more fundamental problem of Trump’s benign view of Russia. Stubb argues Europe has to understand Trump’s take on great-power politics and find a way to disabuse him. “What we fail to see in Europe is that the US and its foreign policy doctrine is based on global competition, not Ukraine and Russia. We have to get out of the mindset that the US is only focused on Ukraine. It is not.”\nStubb added: “Trump’s worldview is not far from what we saw in the 19th-century concert of powers – a big power era sometimes of competition and sometimes cooperation. We have to convince the US administration that free trade and common rules are better than transactional deals, and we show we are serious about defence in Europe and that we are security providers and not security consumers.”\nIf Trump’s vision is broadly one of 19th-century great-power spheres of influence, Stubb argues, then it is necessary to convince Trump that Russia is not a great power and is not worth jettisoning Ukraine and its allies for. “We need to explain that Russia is not any more a big power, economically. It is smaller than Italy, slightly larger than Spain [in terms of its economy],” he said. “Militarily it wanted to deny the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine three years ago. It has advanced less than one percentage point this year, and its interest rate is over 20% and its reserves are out. These are the kind of messages that you have to convey. It is not an easy game, but you just have to keep on engaging the American administration.”\nThe Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski offers a variation: that the great power of the future is Europe, not Russia. He argues Putin has “woken a giant” in the continent. “He has yet no idea how costly this is going to be. Since President Trump came to power we have already doubled our defence spending,” he said.\nSikorski predicts that by the end of the decade, when Nato countries meet the new spending targets, Europe will dwarf Russia. “We are a $19tn economy. Russia will be a trillion-dollar economy. As Europe, without the US, we are spending two and half times more than Russia on a peace footing than Russia is spending on a war footing. All it takes is to spend the money better, on the basis of learning the lessons from Ukraine and then having the will to gel this into a fighting force. We should be grateful to the US for telling it like it is.”\nBut that is five years hence, and the immediate issue is whether Europe and Ukraine, with the US on the sidelines, have the means to make Putin reassess the price of victory.\nWatling, the defence analyst, argued that Ukraine risks leaving gaps on an extended frontline this summer, but if it can survive then Russia will have exhausted its stocks and be reliant on new production, making its war machine more vulnerable to international supply chains. He said Ukraine’s problem was not manpower but training and ammunition.\nEither way, iron has entered the soul of European leaders. They fear Trump is unpersuadable and set on a different course, leaving Europe as the protector of Ukraine.\nKaja Kallas, Europe’s foreign policy chief, said she had been through the five stages of grief over the transatlantic relationship and reached acceptance, but even so she cannot hide the loss.\n“The issue of trust is like a vase,” she said. “You broke the vase, you can glue it back together, but it is not the same vase.”"

    "raw_text": "European leaders – who have promised to impose “massive” new sanctions on Russia after Vladimir Putin’s rejection of a ceasefire in Ukraine – face the prospect of having to introduce their planned expansion of economic restrictions on the Russian war economy without the United States.\nEuropean hopes that Donald Trump might increase the pressure on the Kremlin were dashed after the US president’s two-hour inconclusive phone call with Putin on Monday. Trump did not follow through on previous threats to introduce “large-scale” sanctions on Russia if there was no ceasefire, but instead extolled the prospect of restarting trade with Moscow.\n“Russia wants to do largescale TRADE with the United States when this catastrophic ‘bloodbath’ is over, and I agree,” Trump wrote on social media. Ukraine, he added, “can be a great beneficiary on Trade in the process of rebuilding its Country”.\nFor Europe, the question is: what next? This week the EU approved its 17th round of sanctions against Russia, which had already been in the pipeline weeks before the latest ultimatums to Putin came and went. These were a more incremental set of measures than earlier rounds, as the EU finds it harder to agree new targets, with each sanction requiring unanimity and many big measures that command consensus having already been agreed.\nOn Tuesday the EU added dozens of Russian business people and companies to its sanctions list, bringing the total number of individuals and entities under asset freezes and travel bans to more than 2,400. It also said it had imposed the largest-ever package targeting Putin’s shadow fleet, poorly maintained tankers using flags of convenience that enable Russia to sell oil to countries such as India, in defiance of western restrictions.\nAfter the G7 and EU banned companies on their territories from selling or supporting sales of Russian oil above $60 a barrel, European shipping companies sold dozens of ageing vessels that could be re-registered abroad in places such as India, Hong Kong, Vietnam or Seychelles that are not participating in the economic sanctions against Moscow. These vessels enable Russia to sell its oil above the price cap.\nA further 189 vessels were banned from accessing EU ports and services such as insurance in an effort to stop the trade, bringing the total number of ships under sanctions to 342.\nBut for several EU countries the measures are insufficient, especially as the shadow fleet continues to grow. One EU diplomat estimated that Russia had about 800 vessels in its shadow fleet, compared with only 100 two years ago.\nEven before these measures were finalised, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was preparing “hard-hitting sanctions” targeting Russian energy and banks, including measures against the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas pipelines. Nord Stream 1 was rendered unusable after a series of underwater blasts for which no one has ever claimed responsibility; Nord Stream II never received a licence. But Russia has expressed interest in reviving the gas projects connecting Russia and Germany. “The idea [of sanctions] is to dissuade any interest, notably interest from investors, from pursuing any activity in Nord Stream in the future,” von der Leyen’s spokesperson said.\nAs well as financial sanctions and clamping down on more shadow fleet vessels, the commission is also looking at lowering the $60 oil price cap.\nThe plans fall short of what Ukraine and its strongest allies in the EU would like. EU countries, such as those in the Nordic and Baltic regions, would like the bloc to move urgently to cease buying Russian gas – earlier this month the commission proposed phasing out all Russian gas by the end of 2027. For now, the EU remains Russia’s largest buyer of liquified natural gas, with much of the energy eventually going to Germany, via Belgian ports.\nUkraine is arguing for sanctions on foreign countries that buy Russian oil, according to leaked documents from Kyiv seen by Reuters, which was reported on Wednesday. Such secondary sanctions, which could hit large importers such as China and India, would be a significant step. The EU has so far limited itself to imposing sanctions on a few relatively small companies in China and other states that have been supplying Russia with military technology. Ukraine would also like the oil price cap reduced to $30 a barrel.\nQuestions are growing about what the EU can do without the US – the price cap was agreed by the G7, which includes Washington. Kaja Kallas, the EU’s foreign policy chief, has described the oil price cap as “the most important” measure in the 18th package, because of the role fossil fuels play in keeping the Russian economy afloat. She cited reports on the state of the Russian economy, which, she said, “is not doing well”.\nIf the US moves to ease sanctions on Russia, EU insiders fear European unity could fracture. Hungary, which has routinely threatened to block sanctions, could veto the bloc’s sanctions on the Russian economy when they are up for renewal in July, an explosive move that could end the restrictions on €210bn Russian central bank assets frozen in the EU.\nSome EU countries, notably including a couple of Baltic states, could reimpose sanctions at national level, but many countries do not have the legal framework. Officials are looking at other ways to “Hungary-proof” sanctions, such as imposing capital controls and steep tariffs on Russian economic sectors, rather than sanctions. EU trade policy operates on qualified majority votes, while sanctions require unanimity. But everyone still hopes to avoid this plan B."

    "raw_text": "Calls to step up and coordinate action against the unflagged Russian “shadow fleet” of oil tankers in the Baltic Sea were made this weekend before the EU foreign ministers’ meeting on Monday, which is expected to impose sanctions on 180 ships.\nThe inclusion of those vessels would take the total number of ships under EU sanctions to 350.\nEfforts to stop the shadow fleet, which is estimated to be carrying as much as 85% of Russia’s oil exports and so funding roughly a third of its budget, are seen as a critical proof of the EU’s determination to keep the economic pressure on Russia.\nThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke on Saturday with the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, over the latest steps against the shadow fleet, a group of 500 or so ageing and poorly insured tankers using flags of convenience to export Russian oil to countries such as India, in defiance of sanctions mounted in 2022 by G7 countries including Canada.\nBut the Lithuanian foreign minister, Kęstutis Budrys, said current enforcement was ineffective and now faced the threat of Russian military reprisals. Each day, about three loaded shadow tankers pass through northern European waters, including the Danish straits and the Channel.\nIn a further sign of tensions, Russian authorities detained a Greek-owned oil tanker on Sunday after it left an Estonian port while sailing on an agreed route in Russia’s territorial waters.\nThe Liberian-flagged Green Admire tanker had left the port of Sillamäe in north-east Estonia carrying a cargo of shale oil, destined for Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.\nBudrys, speaking at the Lennart Meri conference in Tallinn, highlighted uncertainty about the law on interdiction in international waters, and fear of an all-out military confrontation with Russia. The Estonian defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, called for all ships under sanctions to be debarred from entering EU economic exclusion zone waters, as they are debarred from entering EU ports. The move would severely restrict the Russian fleet but would arguably breach maritime law.\nThe battle over the shadow fleet intensified last week when a Russian Sukhoi Su-35 jet flew into Estonia’s airspace in what looked like a reprisal for a tanker named the Jaguar, likely to be carrying Russian oil, being escorted out of Estonian economic waters by the country’s navy. It was not clear whether the ship, already subject to sanctions by the UK, was sailing without any flag registration, the surest legal ground for interdicting a ship.\nThe Estonian navy believed the ship might pose a threat to nearby underwater cables, and contacted it to check its status and registration.\nFaced by resistance from the Jaguar crew, the Estonians drew back from trying to board the ship to inspect its cargo and instead escorted it into the international waters of the Gulf of Finland on its way to the Russian port of Primorsk. As the ship was being escorted, a Russian jet entered Estonian airspace for a minute without permission.\nIt is seen as the first incident in which Russia has shown military force in support of the shadow fleet, and its first entry into Estonian airspace for at least three years.\nThe fleet is thought to have expanded, possibly to as many as 700 largely uninsured tankers, to circumvent rules that deny high-quality insurance to ships carrying oil to be sold above $60 (£45) a barrel. The innovative US-designed oil cap policy balances two objectives – limiting Russian revenues for its war machine, while maintaining the supply of oil for the world economy. Ships that operate without insurance can be be placed under sanctions by G7 countries.\nBudrys said the paradox was that less than half of the ships under either EU, US or UK sanctions had been embargoed by all three. He said he wanted to see all ships in the fleet under sanctions, and for the level of proof required to sanction a ship to be reduced and standardised.\nBaltic states, he said, needed to clarify the unclear national protocols under the UN convention on the law of the sea (Unclos) about the right to inspect an unflagged ship, especially inside a country’s exclusive economic zone. Since last June, the Estonian transport agency has checked the documents of more than 450 ships, but the right to interdict in international waters is strictly limited.\nBudrys rejected the fears of some Baltic shipping companies that a more aggressive posture would lead to restrictions on freedom of navigation for western ships in the South China Sea.\nHe said lawyers often advised ministers that the current law on interdiction was unclear, but he said there was no point trying to reopen the outdated Unclos itself, since the process would take too long.\nHe said: “Last week’s events involving Russian protection of the Jaguar through the use of Russian jets changes the overall assessment and picture. Russia now is showing force, creating an incident and even entering Nato airspace to protect these vessels.”\nSince January, Nato’s Baltic Sentry mission has been established to protect the Baltic Sea’s critical infrastructure, principally undersea cables, but it has no direct responsibility over the shadow fleet.\nBudrys said: “We need not only to continue Baltic Sentry, but to expand its mission, because the increase in the shadow fleet increases the probability of military incidents in the Baltic Sea. This is serious.”\nBut Benjamin Hilgenstock, the head of macroeconomic research at the Kyiv School of Economics, claims the oil price cap has proved unenforceable, partly since no means exists to check that oil has been traded at the declared price.\nCritics say that despite the existence of a 14-country shadow fleet expert group, there is no body coordinating enforcement action, or intelligence about the shadow fleet, with different countries adopting different approaches.\nJohn Mead, the deputy commander of Allied Joint Force Command Brunssum, stressed Nato’s focus was to protect underwater cables, but in pursuit of this had hailed 1,800 ships to check flag status. It was also launching a fleet of drones to improve monitoring.\nHe added “the Russians will exhaust themselves very, very quickly if they want to up their posture by escorting every single shadow fleet vessel through the Baltic Sea.”\nAnna Wieslander, the director for northern Europe at the Atlantic Council, said in the middle of last year “we realised that this not in parallel to Russia’s efforts sustain its war economy, the shadow fleet is at the core of its whole system.”\nShe said the episode last week showed “the shadow fleet is at the core of their national security. The first step is to realise the magnitude of this for the war economy. We should sanction them all, why not?”"

    "raw_text": "A group of six whistleblowers have come forward with allegations of a cover-up of harm to children on Meta’s virtual reality devices and apps. They say the social media company, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and offers a line of VR headsets and games, deleted or doctored internal safety research that showed children being exposed to grooming, sexual harassment and violence in its 3D realms.\n“Meta knew that underage children were using its products, but figured, ‘Hey, kids drive engagement,’ and it was making them cash,” Jason Sattizahn, one of the whistleblowers who worked on the company’s VR research, said in a statement. “Meta has compromised their internal teams to manipulate research and straight-up erase data that they don’t like.”\nSattizahn and the other whistleblowers, all current or former Meta employees, have disclosed these findings and a trove of documents to Congress, according to the Washington Post, which first reported the allegations. Sattizahn and Cayce Savage, who was Meta’s lead researcher on youth user experience for VR, will appear before the US Senate judiciary subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law on Tuesday.\nDani Lever, a Meta spokesperson, said the company has approved 180 studies related to its VR Reality Labs since 2022, which include research on youth safety and wellbeing.\n“These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative,” she said, adding that Meta has introduced features to its VR products to limit unwanted contact and supervision tools for parents.\nThe whistleblower allegations made public on Monday claim that on Meta’s VR products, the company could have done more to ensure children’s safety. The whistleblowers say company managers instructed staff to avoid research that might show evidence of child harm in virtual reality.\nIn one instance, a researcher was reportedly told to “swallow that ick”.\nIn another instance, a researcher was allegedly told to delete information from an interview they had conducted with a German family, according to the Washington Post. During that interview, a teenage boy told the researcher that his brother, who was under the age of 10, had “frequently encountered strangers” in Meta’s VR and that “adults had sexually propositioned his little brother”.\nThe allegations arise as a steady procession of former Meta employees have come forward to criticize the company for not doing enough to protect children from harm on its social media products. Lawmakers have also repeatedly grilled Meta executives for pushing content to youth that promotes bullying, drug abuse and self-harm.\nAt one congressional hearing in January 2024, Republican senator Josh Hawley prodded Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, into publicly apologizing.\n“I’m sorry for everything you have all been through,” Zuckerberg said at the time. “No one should go through the things that your families have suffered, and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.”\nMarsha Blackburn, a Republican senator from Tennessee, said the revelations about Meta’s VR products show Congress needs to pass legislation putting guardrails on social media companies.\n“Instead of heeding serious concerns about widespread child harm on their platforms, Meta silenced employees who dared to come forward, buried egregious evidence, and shamelessly used innocent kids as pawns to line their pockets,” Blackburn said. “These whistleblowers should be commended for having the courage to expose Meta’s disgusting web of lies.”\nThe six whistleblowers are represented by the legal nonprofit Whistleblower Aid. They are scheduled to testify before the subcommittee on Tuesday.\nThe current and former Meta employees have also filed a detailed disclosure to Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission."

    "raw_text": "In a stunning moment during a congressional hearing over alleged online harms to children, the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, turned to parents of victims on the Senate floor and apologized.\n“I’m sorry for everything you have all been through,” Zuckerberg said as parents held up photos of their children who have died following sexual exploitation or harassment via social media. “No one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.”\nThe Snap Inc CEO, Evan Spiegel, offered similar condolences to parents whose children were able to access illegal drugs on Snapchat. Parents of more than 60 teenagers filed suit in late 2023 against Snap for allegedly facilitating their children’s acquisitions of drugs that were used in overdoses.\n“I’m so sorry that we have not been able to prevent these tragedies. We work very hard to block all search terms related to drugs on our platform,” Spiegel said.\nZuckerberg and Spiegel were among five executives being grilled in Congress on Wednesday in a hearing titled Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis. The hearing was called to “examine and investigate the plague of online child sexual exploitation”, according to a statement from the US Senate judiciary committee. Also attendance were chief executive officers including Linda Yaccarino of X (formerly Twitter), Shou Zi Chew of TikTok, and Jason Citron of Discord.\nZuckerberg’s opening statement may have rankled those he offered an olive branch to. The tech executive said: “The existing body of scientific work has not shown a causal link between using social media and young people having worse mental health.” Senator Josh Hawley excoriated him for the remark later in the hearing.\nThe Senate was packed with families of children and advocates, with Lindsey Graham stating “we have a large audience, the largest I’ve seen in this room”. The South Carolina Republican senator accused social media firms of “destroying lives, and threatening democracy itself”.\n“I know you don’t mean it to be so, but you have blood on your hands,” he told executives.\nIn opening statements, Dick Durbin said combatting dangers faced by children online had been one of his “top priorities” as chair of the committee and that online child sexual exploitation is “a crisis in America”. Durbin told executives that their platforms social media and messaging apps have “given predators powerful new tools to sexually exploit children”.\n“Their design choices, their failures to adequately invest in trust and safety, their constant pursuit of engagement and profit over basic safety of all put our kids and grandkids at risk,” Durbin said.\nExecutives appearing in Congress repeatedly highlighted controls and tools they have introduced to manage children’s online experiences and mitigate harm. In prepared remarks, Zuckerberg stated that Meta had introduced more than 30 such tools over the last eight years, including controls that let parents set time limits for app usage and see who their children are following and engaging with online. He added that Meta had spent $20bn on safety and security since 2016 and employed about 40,000 people to address such concerns.\n“We’re committed to protecting young people from abuse on our services, but this is an ongoing challenge,” he said. “As we improve defenses in one area, criminals shift their tactics, and we have to come up with new responses.”\nA two-year Guardian investigation suggested that Meta has struggled to prevent criminals from using its platforms to buy and sell children for sex. New Mexico’s attorney general sued Meta in early December, alleging the company “enabled adults to find, message and groom minors” for sexual exploitation. Damning internal documents have emerged from the suit. Wednesday’s hearing also comes amid a growing body of reports about negative impacts of social media on the mental health of young people.\nMembers of Congress highlighted potential legislative solutions to concerns about children online, and repeatedly asked each executive if they supported a handful of bills introduced to address these harms. Central to the hearing is the Kids Online Safety Act – a bill that has been endorsed by a number of advocacy groups but has been criticized by others for serious privacy and censorship concerns.\nSnap Inc previously endorsed the bill, and X CEO Yaccarino said for the first time on Wednesday that the company also backs it. At the hearing, X also became the first big tech firm to endorse Stop CSAM Act, a bill from Durbin that some groups say also raises civil rights concerns due to its targeting of encryption. Executives from Meta, Discord and TikTok declined to endorse the bills outright, drawing ire from Graham.\n“The bottom line, I’ve come to conclude, is that you aren’t going to support any of this,” he said. “If you’re waiting on these guys to solve the problem, we’re going to die waiting.”"

    "raw_text": "Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has not done enough to safeguard children after Molly Russell’s death, according to a whistleblower who said the social media company already has the infrastructure in place to shield teenagers from harmful content.\nArturo Béjar, a former senior engineer and consultant at the Instagram and Facebook owner, said if the company had learned its lessons from Molly’s death and subsequent inquest it would have created a safer experience for young users. According to research conducted by Béjar on Instagram users, 8.4% of 13- to 15-year-olds had seen someone harm themselves or threaten to harm themselves in the past week.\n“If they had learned the lessons from Molly Russell, they would create a product safe for 13-15-year-olds where in the last week one in 12 don’t see someone harm themselves, or threaten to do so. And where the vast majority of them feel supported when they do come across self-harm content,” Béjar told the Guardian.\nRussell, a 14-year-old girl from Harrow, north-west London, took her own life in 2017 after viewing harmful content related to suicide, self-harm, depression and anxiety on Instagram and Pinterest. In a landmark ruling in 2022, an inquest into her death found that Molly “died from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content”.\nBéjar said Zuckerberg had the tools at his disposal to make Instagram, in particular, safer for teenagers but the company has chosen not to make those changes.\n“They either need a different chief executive or they need him to wake up tomorrow morning and say: ‘This kind of content is not allowed on the platform’, because they already have the infrastructure and the tools for that [content] to be impossible to find.”\nBéjar’s research at Instagram, and attempts to get the company to act on it, feature in a lawsuit brought against Meta by Raúl Torrez, the New Mexico attorney general, that claims Meta fails to protect children from sexual abuse, predatory approaches and human trafficking. Unredacted documents from the lawsuit show that Meta employees warned the company was “defending the status quo” in the wake of Molly’s death when “the status quo is clearly unacceptable to media, many impacted families and … will be unacceptable to the wider public”.\nBéjar’s responsibilities as an engineering director included child safety tools and helping children cope with harmful content such as bullying material. Having left the business as a senior engineer in 2015, he returned as a consultant in 2019 for a two-year period where he conducted research showing that one in eight children aged 13 to 15 on Instagram had received unwanted sexual advances, while one in five had been victims of bullying on the platform and 8% had viewed self-harm content.\nThe former Meta employee has called on the company to set goals around reducing harmful content. “That creates the incentive structure for them to work on these things over a long period of time,” he said.\nBejar has urged Meta to undertake a series of changes including: making it easier for users to flag unwanted content and state why they don’t want to see it; regularly survey users about their experiences on Meta platforms; and making it easier for users to submit reports about their experiences on Meta services.\nBéjar continues to monitor the Instagram platform and says harmful content – including self-harm material – remains on the app as well as clear evidence of underage users. Instagram has a minimum age limit of 13.\nBéjar has been meeting politicians, regulators and campaigners in the UK this week including Molly’s father, Ian Russell, whose Molly Rose Foundation facilitated his visit. Béjar testified before Congress last year detailing his experience at the company and the “awful experiences” of his teenage daughter and her friends on Instagram, including unwanted sexual advances and harassment.\nIt would take three months for Meta to carry out an efficient crackdown on self-harm content, Béjar added. “They have all the machinery necessary to do that. What it requires is the will and the policy decision to say, for teenagers, we’re going to create a truly safe environment that we’re going to measure and report on publicly.”\nA Meta spokesperson said: “Every day countless people inside and outside of Meta are working on how to help keep young people safe online. Working with parents and experts, we have introduced over 30 tools and resources to support teens and their families in having safe, positive experiences online. All of this work continues.”\nMeta points to numerous safety initiatives including automatically setting under 16-year-olds’ accounts to private mode when they join Instagram, restricting adults from sending private messages to teenagers who don’t follow them and allowing Instagram users to report bullying, harassment and sexual activity."

    "raw_text": "A former top cybersecurity executive at WhatsApp filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that parent company Meta disregarded internal flaws in the app’s digital defenses and exposed billions of its users. He says the company systematically violated cybersecurity regulations and retaliated against him for reporting the failures.\nAttaullah Baig, who served as head of security for WhatsApp from 2021 to 2025, claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to user data without proper oversight, potentially violating a US government order that imposed a $5bn penalty on the company in 2020.\nHe also claimed the company failed to remedy the hacking and takeover of more than 100,000 accounts each day, ignoring his pleas and proposed fixes and choosing instead to prioritize user growth. The lawsuit, filed in US federal court in San Francisco, alleges Facebook-owner Meta failed to implement basic cybersecurity measures, including adequate data handling and breach detection capabilities.\nAccording to the 115-page complaint, Baig discovered through internal security testing that WhatsApp engineers could “move or steal user data” including contact information, IP addresses and profile photos “without detection or audit trail”.\nThe filing claims Baig repeatedly raised concerns with senior executives, including the WhatsApp head, Will Cathcart, and Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. Meta acquired Whatsapp for $19bn in 2014. The app now boasts three billion users, according to Meta.\nWhatsApp’s vice president of communications Carl Woog wrote in a statement, “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”\nBaig alleges he faced escalating retaliation after his initial reports in 2021, including negative performance reviews, verbal warnings and ultimately termination in February 2025 for apparent “poor performance”.\nThe company emphasized that Baig left due to poor performance, with multiple senior engineers independently validating that his work was below expectations. Meta noted in a statement that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration dismissed Baig’s initial complaint, finding that it had not retaliated against him.\nBefore joining Meta, Baig worked in cybersecurity roles at PayPal, Capital One and other major financial institutions.\nHe filed complaints with federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission before pursuing the current litigation.\nThe case adds to ongoing scrutiny of Meta’s data protection practices across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, serving billions of users globally.\nMeta agreed to the 2020 government settlement following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved improper harvesting of data from 50 million Facebook users. The consent order remains in effect until 2040.\nIn his whistleblower complaint, Baig is requesting reinstatement, back pay and compensatory damages, along with potential regulatory enforcement action against the company."

The same production of Cabaret is still being staged in London, where it swept the 2022 Olivier awards with Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley in the leading roles. Porter and Wallace also appeared in the West End production.\nDespite acclaim, ticket sales for the Broadway production have declined recently, with the New York Times reporting that the show’s weekly grosses peaked at $2m in May 2024, but dropped to $505,142 by the end of August 2025. The show will now close at a loss on 21 September, rather than 19 October.\nProducer Adam Speers said it was a “painful decision” to end the show’s Broadway run.\n“Billy was an extraordinary Emcee, bringing his signature passion and remarkable talent. We wish Billy a speedy recovery and I look forward to working with him again in the very near future,” he said.\nThe Broadway production’s two alternates for Emcee, Marty Lauter and David Merino, will share the role for the final performances."

    "raw_text": "Billy Porter is known for going big. The 54-year-old actor and singer routinely stole scenes as the drag ball emcee Pray Tell in FX’s drama Pose, a role that won him an Emmy. In Amazon’s 2021 update of Cinderella, he turned the fairy godmother into a fabulous, tough-talking fairy “godmuvva”, as he puts it. But his latest role, in the Bill Oliver-directed relationship drama Our Son, takes a different tack: as Gabriel, a relatively meek stay-at-home dad divorcing his husband, Nicky, (Luke Evans), Porter is required to play small, wounded and, sometimes, bitter, without any of the glitz or glam of his best known characters.\nIt’s the kind of role that Porter always knew he could pull off, but has rarely been considered for. Even fans, he says, don’t really get it. “At the premiere, somebody said to me, ‘Oh my God, Billy, how do you act like that?’” he recalls. “Would you ask Viola Davis that question? Would you ask Al Pacino that question? The world has a difficult time understanding that fabulous and serious do coexist – and you’re looking at him.”\nIn case you were wondering, yes – this is basically how Porter speaks 100% of the time. Over the course of our 45-minute interview, he compares himself with the four-time Oscar nominee Viola Davis on three separate occasions; he punctuates his musings on a ceasefire in the Middle East with the word “doll”. Peering out from Zoom in a hotel room in Florida, dressed (relatively) casually in a white T-shirt with sparkly rainbow accents, he comes across as a born orator, delivering every response as if he’s playing to the cheap seats in an auditorium. His charisma, which made him a star on TV and on Broadway, is on full display.\nOur Son, though, is the first time Porter has been able to properly flex his dramatic chops on screen. Preparing for the role, he says, was relatively easy. “I could connect to the complexities of what it is to be in a marriage,” he says. Although relatively circumspect about details of his personal life during our conversation – particularly because his mother died only a week before – he does reveal that working on Our Son ended with a case of life imitating art. “I was married at the time, and I am no longer, and I knew in the filming of this movie that I probably wouldn’t be married after it was done,” he says. There is one way, of course, that his divorce, from his husband of six years, Adam Smith, felt “vastly different” from that of Gabriel and Nicky: “It’s not amicable – that’s all I can say.”\nGabriel is the kind of complex queer character that Porter dreamed of playing when he was struggling to make it as an actor in the 1990s. Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he graduated from Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Fine Arts in the early 90s and moved to New York shortly afterwards. He soon found that complex roles for Black performers were few and far between; his big break was as the Teen Angel in the 1994 Broadway revival of Grease – hardly the multifaceted opportunity he had hoped for. “I was wearing 14 inches of orange rubber hair on my head and prancing around like a Little Richard automaton on crack,” he recalls. “I was a clown.”\nHe soon realised that he had to “shift the consciousness of the people” in order to find work that he felt was meaningful – and that would involve hard work on his part. He saw Viola Davis – “a friend of mine, not close … colleague … we’ve worked together … we know each other,” he says before mentioning her name, seemingly unsure of how to classify their relationship – as an example of how a serious Black performer could make it in the suffocating Hollywood system.\n“She played every crack mother, every mother of a drug addict, every stereotypical dark-skinned Black woman role they threw at her, and she imbued those characters with dignity. I was like, ‘That’s what I’m gonna do,’” he says. He decided that he “didn’t care about being pigeonholed in the business”, and that he would “take the queer roles and imbue them with so much dignity” that by the time the industry was ready to give a serious, nuanced role to a Black gay man, he would be “the bitch that you call”.\nAt this point, Porter has been working in entertainment for more than 30 years, and has had a front-row seat to the seismic shifts that have taken place as the industry has reoriented itself around streaming. During last year’s Screen Actors Guild (Sag) strike, he was an outspoken critic of studio chiefs such as Disney’s Bob Iger, who suggested that striking workers’ demands were unreasonable; he also revealed that the instability resulting from the strike meant that he was putting his house on the market, for fear of no longer being able to afford it. A few months removed from the resolution of the strike, he feels like Sag and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) “came to some really good terms”, but he’s still miffed that “the burden and the fallout still gets passed on to us, and not the people in the C-suite”.\n“Our deals are going away, our jobs are going away, everyone’s downsizing, but the people in the C-suite are still making [money],” he says. He’s still frustrated that there’s no accountability for “the people who ran the business into the ground”. “Whose fault is it that the business can’t sustain itself and is going to implode?” he asks, his eyes steely behind thick-rimmed glasses. “Streaming destroyed the artist’s ability to make money, our ability to participate in capitalism. Being an artist, we’re always freelance, and very often blue collar.”\nThat it took so long for the streamers to renegotiate terms with Sag-Aftra, Porter says, has resulted in a shrinking middle class of working actors. “Those Friends people are making $100m a year!” he exclaims. “I’m getting six-cent cheques! It’s not OK!”\nEven so, Porter describes himself as one of the “extremely blessed ones” who is able to generate income through other means – “I’m a person who is so multi-faceted – I have a brand new pop album out, honey, on Republic records. I can go back to do a Broadway show, you know what I mean?” – but he makes it clear that he’s still very much a working actor. “People have this perception that we’re millionaires. You know how much I made on Cinderella? Only enough to cover my mortgage for four months, maybe,” he says. “It’s unacceptable that I’m one award away from an Egot (he has won an Emmy, Grammy and a Tony, but not an Oscar) and one strike puts me out of my house.”\nPorter is, indeed, an impressive multi-hyphenate: in addition to acting and singing, he also made his directorial debut in 2022 with the Amazon Prime teen film Anything’s Possible, about a transgender high-school student. In his early-30s, a period of his career when “the work dried up”, he took a screenwriting course at the University of California in Los Angeles; now, he’s putting those skills to work, co-writing a biopic based on the life of the revolutionary writer and activist James Baldwin, in which he will also star. His motivation is simple: “If not me, who? I’ve been sitting around waiting for people to tell the Langston Hughes story, the James Baldwin story – anyone Black and queer, as far as I’m concerned. I’m done waiting – I’ll do it myself. The audacity, right?” he says. “Who’s going to tell it better than the Black gay man who embodies that in today’s age? It’s such an important story to tell, and I feel so blessed to be in this time where it will get told.”\nPorter says that Baldwin’s story “couldn’t have been told before this time because nobody gave a fuck”, but that executives are wiser, now, to the fact that stories catering to marginalised audiences can be hugely lucrative. “If there’s green [money] attached to it, executives will care, and that’s always across the board,” he says. As often becomes clear during our conversation, Porter seems to have thought this concept through in his head, in a way that doesn’t necessarily translate out loud. He says: “How do we, on this end, acknowledge that the colour is green? It’s not black, it’s not white, it’s not yellow, it’s not Muslim – the colour is green.”\nHe has been inspired to see Greta Gerwig – his co-star in the 2014 film adaptation of the Philip Roth novel The Humbling, “before anybody knew her” – push a female-oriented film like Barbie to box office success in the way he hopes to with Black queer stories. “Barbie is green – [Gerwig] got all the fucking green; she can do whatever she wants, because they want that,” he says. “I’m trying to figure out for myself what that looks like, because we have to understand, too, it’s a business – it is show business, and business is the bigger word. We cannot lose sight of that.”\nPorter describes his Baldwin biopic as “sprawling”, and says that a piece of the novelist’s writing will be used as a framing device through which to explore his whole life. Baldwin, of course, was a strong advocate for the rights of Palestinians; Porter has been staunchly supportive of Israel in the past, opposing the cultural boycott of a film festival in Tel Aviv in 2021, and he was one of 700 celebrities who signed an open letter last year asking Hollywood to support Israel in its retaliation against Gaza after Hamas’s attack on 7 October.\nWhen I ask Porter how he plans to navigate Baldwin’s relationship with the Palestinian rights movement in the script, given his own support of Israel, he quickly clarifies his position. “First and foremost, I’m supportive of a two-state solution. The second thing is, this is not my hill, and I am not going to die on it. It’s not mine! I’m not Jewish, nor am I Palestinian,” he says. “What’s going on over there is horrific – the choices that we, in America, have made, are wrong. Please don’t make me a poster child for that. I don’t want to be in the conversation, because I don’t know enough about it!\n“I am in support of my Jewish friends and my Palestinian friends,” he says. “It’s a two-state solution that’s been going on for thousands of years over there. I don’t know!” he says, letting out a nervous giggle. “What I do know is that we don’t need to continue to be bombing over there. I know we should stop doing that, I do believe that. And the Palestinians – not Palestinians, what are the people called, who started the shit? The extremists?”\nHamas?\n“Thank you! See, I don’t even know. All I know is that the extremists came in and did something that was horrific, and then they retaliated,” he says. “Now, the retaliation is a little overkill, now, doll. But why are we at war at all? That’s not just about them, that’s everywhere. We’re always at war. It breaks my heart. I don’t know what to say, and I don’t know what to do, other than hug you and say I’m sorry, and what can we do to fix it? I’m in support of peace! Fucking peace!”\nAt this point, Porter is the most worked up he’s been through our conversation – but in a split-second, he’s composed himself. “There’s nothing to navigate – I’m not James Baldwin, he’s a character, so I have to be true to the character. I don’t know what he was talking about in the 40s, 50s, 60s – it’s 2024 now. I don’t have the history to even know what the version of the Israel-Palestine conflict was when he was around,” he says. “It’s not a part of the script – his civil rights work in America is what we’re focused on, more than what he thought about the crisis in the Middle East.”\nOur time is up, and Porter thanks me for asking the question, noting that his Instagram comments have been filled with people writing “Free Palestine”. “I’ve been getting a lot of bullshit online about it – I’m like, ‘I don’t know, y’all!’ The man’s been dead since 1987, please!” he says. As ever, it’s a big exit."

    "raw_text": "An intimate revival of the musical Cabaret, which transformed London’s Playhouse theatre into the debauched Kit Kat Club of Weimar Berlin, has triumphed at this year’s Olivier awards.\nThe production won in seven categories at the ceremony, which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Sunday for the first time in three years and hosted by comedian Jason Manford. Covid forced the cancellation of the last two annual awards shows, though a prerecorded virtual ceremony served as a stopgap in autumn 2020.\nCabaret took all four awards for actors in a musical: Eddie Redmayne (as the Kit Kat’s grotesque ringleader, the Emcee) and Jessie Buckley (as singer Sally Bowles) in their leading roles, and Elliot Levey and Liza Sadovy as supporting characters whose romance is imperilled by the rise of nazism. Rebecca Frecknall was named best director, and Cabaret also took the awards for best musical revival and best sound design (for Nick Lidster).\nRedmayne, who previously played the Emcee in an Edinburgh fringe production of John Kander and Fred Ebb’s musical in 2001, returned to the West End for the first time in 10 years to reprise the role. It brings him his second Olivier award: he won in 2010 for playing the assistant to painter Mark Rothko in the play Red. Redmayne paid tribute to Buckley, saying he would “never have gone on this ride” without her. When Buckley took the stage to collect her award she joked that it was “like my worst nightmare and my biggest dream all at once.”\nThe winners of the Olivier awards, overseen by the Society of London Theatre, are chosen by a team of industry figures, stage luminaries and theatre-loving members of the public. The Oliviers honour London productions, but this year’s second biggest winner, Life of Pi, is a success story that began in Sheffield. Lolita Chakrabarti’s puppet-powered adaptation of Yann Martel’s much-loved novel opened at the city’s Crucible theatre in 2019 and its West End transfer was, like many productions, severely delayed by the pandemic.\nLife of Pi won five awards including best new play, best lighting design (Tim Lutkin and Andrzej Goulding) and best set design (Tim Hatley for the design and Nick Barnes and Finn Caldwell for the puppets). Hiran Abeysekera was named best actor for his portrayal of the shipwrecked teenager Pi, and the best supporting actor prize was shared by seven actors who play the tiger in the show: one gives the creature a voice, and three pairs of performers each represent its head, heart and hind.\nManford presided over a joyous ceremony with plenty of gags. Referring to the slap that Will Smith gave presenter Chris Rock at the Oscars, after a joke about Smith’s wife Jada Pinkett Smith, Manford said: “I will very much be keeping your wives’ names out of my chuffing mouth … this is an evening for back-slapping not face-slapping!” Later he joked about Andrew Lloyd Webber’s declaration that he would risk arrest to open his theatre during the shutdown, calling the composer “the Che Guevara of the West End”.\nMany speeches were marked by the sense of joy in a community coming together again after the prolonged instability and disruption caused by Covid. The actor Lesley Manville also introduced a special performance in solidarity with the people of Ukraine during what she called a time of “unbearable suffering” after the Russian invasion. The Ukrainian mezzo soprano Kseniia Nikolaieva, whose family are still in her home land, performed the country’s national anthem. In his speech, Elliot Levey paid tribute to his late Ukrainian grandfather, who fled Kyiv many years ago after his brothers were killed in a pogrom, and Levey criticised the “incompetence and hostility” of the UK’s current scheme for hosting Ukrainians.\nThe prize for best entertainment or comedy play was taken by Pride and Prejudice* (*Sort Of), a rambunctious, all-female riff on Jane Austen’s novel first staged at Glasgow’s tiny Tron theatre in 2018. Despite rave reviews, its West End run was cut short in February after Covid restrictions led to plummeting audience numbers and losses estimated at up to £25,000 a week. Back to the Future: The Musical, whose 2020 run in Manchester ended early due to Covid before it transferred to London’s Adelphi theatre, was named best new musical.\nThe award for best revival of a play went to a canny production of Nick Payne’s two-hander Constellations, in which four pairs of actors took turns to play a couple whose relationship is set against the backdrop of quantum multiverse theory. Directed by Michael Longhurst, the Donmar Warehouse production was presented at the Vaudeville theatre while the Donmar underwent renovation works. For her performance in Constellations, Sheila Atim won best actress. It is her second Olivier award; she also took best actress in a supporting role in a musical for Girl from the North Country in 2018. Atim said the play was about “fighting adversity together” and that “we all did that” during the pandemic. She thanked her co-star Ivanno Jeremiah and also savoured the fact that, in the Donmar’s diverse approach to casting for Constellations, her role was subsequently played by a man, Omari Douglas, when he appeared opposite Russell Tovey later on in the run.\nThe National Theatre’s production of Larry Kramer’s autobiographical play The Normal Heart, about the 1980s Aids crisis in New York, had nominations for best revival and four of its actors. Liz Carr won for her performance as a character based on Dr Linda Laubenstein, a physician and pioneering HIV/Aids researcher. Carr thanked the National Theatre for giving a disabled actor the chance to play the role while stressing that “it shouldn’t be a chance, it should be a right”. She wore a dress decorated with some of her character’s lines from the play and said The Normal Heart combined her twin interests in art and activism and that its story resonated amid a global health crisis and the response of an “apathetic” government. The award for outstanding achievement in an affiliate theatre went to Old Bridge, a play by Igor Memic set around his home town of Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Papatango’s production was staged at the Bush theatre.\nIn a bumper year for escapist musical spectaculars, a lavish production of Cole Porter’s Anything Goes – which broke box-office records at the Barbican – won one award, for best theatre choreographer, from a total of nine nominations. Anything Goes received a five-star review from the Guardian, as did the blockbuster Disney musical Frozen, which reopened at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane after a £60m renovation. Frozen had four nominations but none resulted in a win. Moulin Rouge! The Musical won for its sumptuous costumes designed by Catherine Zuber. Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Musical had four nominations, with orchestrator Simon Hale winning in his category. The ceremony was punctuated with performances from nominated musicals and ended with a tribute to the late Stephen Sondheim.\nThe Royal Opera House was recognised for Peter Whelan and the Irish Baroque Orchestra’s Bajazet (outstanding achievement in opera) and for Jenůfa, directed by Claus Guth (best new opera production), as well as for best family show for Wolf Witch Giant Fairy, a folk opera created with the company Little Bulb in the ROH’s Linbury theatre. Both dance awards went to productions at Sadler’s Wells: Revisor, Crystal Pite and Jonathon Young’s show based on Nikolai Gogol’s play The Government Inspector, was named best new dance production, while Jolly Folly, an ode to silent movies choreographed by rising star Arielle Smith for English National Ballet, won outstanding achievement in dance.\nSpecial recognition awards were given to five individuals this year to recognise their outstanding contributions to the theatre industry. They went to Lisa Burger, executive director and joint chief executive of the National Theatre (who was also recently made a CBE); the designer Bob King, who has created artwork and advertising campaigns for many major West End shows; Gloria Louis, the inclusion and diversity lead for Delfont Mackintosh Theatres; philanthropist Susie Sainsbury; and Sylvia Young, who founded her drama school 50 years ago. Its alumni include singers Amy Winehouse and Dua Lipa, actors Daniel Kaluuya and Keeley Hawes, and past Olivier winner Billie Piper."

    "raw_text": "Seabed bottom trawling, described by the chair of a Commons committee as a “destructive” fishing practice, will continue in English marine protected areas (MPAs), the government has announced.\nDespite having official designation as protected areas for creatures including dolphins, puffins and seahorses, damaging industrial methods are still allowed to take place.\nThese include bottom trawling, the practice of dragging immense and heavy nets across the seabed to scoop up all in their path, most of which is discarded while more prized fish such as sole, cod and haddock are kept.\nIn a letter to the environment audit committee, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: “The government’s policy is not to introduce whole-site bans on bottom-towed fishing gear in MPAs.\n“Our approach is to only restrict fishing which is assessed as damaging to the specific protected features in each MPA.”\nDefra called a blanket ban on trawling “disproportionate”, adding that it was consulting on bans on trawling in some MPAs.\nOther countries are banning the practice. The EU has a goal to ban it in all its marine protected areas by 2030, Sweden has banned it, as has Greece. The lack of a ban in so-called “protected areas” has led to environmental groups referring to MPAs in the UK as “paper parks”.\nThe Commons committee has written to the new environment secretary, Emma Reynolds, asking her to reconsider a complete ban on bottom trawling within offshore MPAs and to clarify whether she will seek to ensure the government’s approach does not undermine the integrity of protected waters.\nThe issue became more prominent after being highlighted in a film by Sir David Attenborough released earlier this year to coincide with his 99th birthday.\nIt showed the barren destruction left in the wake of the trawlers, with areas that once thronged with fish, seahorses and other marine life decimated.\n“The idea of bulldozing a rainforest causes outrage, yet we do the same underwater every day,” says Attenborough in the film. “Surely you would argue it must be illegal.”\nThe chair of the committee, Toby Perkins MP, said: “Bottom trawling is a destructive practice. We hugely welcome the government moving forward with banning it in more protected areas of our oceans.\n“However, the committee is disappointed that the government has not committed to wider bans within marine protected areas which risk undermining the integrity of marine protected areas.”\nA Defra spokesperson said: “Restoring our oceans to good health is essential for both nature and for fishing businesses.\n“This government is taking decisive steps to ban bottom trawling when it is damaging protected seabeds, and our consultation makes clear how this would be implemented appropriately.”"

    "raw_text": "When David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II documentary aired eight years ago, its impact was so strong it was credited with bringing about a revolution in the way people use plastics. Now film-makers are hoping he can do the same for other destructive environmental practices that the world’s best-known living naturalist describes as “draining the life from our oceans”.\nThe industrial fishing method of bottom trawling is the focus of a large part of Attenborough’s latest film, Ocean, which airs in cinemas from 8 May, the naturalist’s 99th birthday. In a remarkably no-holds-barred narrative, he says these vessels tear the seabed with such force “the trails of destruction can be seen from space”. He also condemns what he calls “modern day colonialism at sea”, where huge trawlers, operating off the coasts of countries reliant on fish for food and livelihoods, are blamed for dwindling local catches.\nIndustrial fishing, he says, has killed “two-thirds of all large predator fish”. In Antarctica, trawlers may be “removing the foundation of an entire ecosystem”.\nSharks and turtles that survived the extinction of the dinosaurs, he says, may not survive hundreds of thousands of industrial trawling vessels, which compete with marine life and coastal fishing communities in “every corner of the ocean”.\nIn railing against such widespread fishing practices, Attenborough has “gone a lot further” than he has before, says Keith Scholey, one of the film’s directors and co-founder of Silverback Films, who has worked with Attenborough for more than 40 years.\n“He’s come to a new place. He knows how much the public trusts him and how careful he has to be. He does want to bring about this change. So he absolutely has gone a lot further with this than before.\n“He is very sure that this is an opportunity for the world.”\nThe film’s most dramatic scenes include world-first footage showing bottom trawlers, including a scallop dredger off the south coast of Britain and another in Turkey. Clouds of carbon-capturing sediment are churned up, and fish and other marine life leap in vain to escape heavy beams smashing their way across the sea bed, destroying everything in their path.\n“The idea of bulldozing a rainforest causes outrage, yet we do the same underwater every day,” says Attenborough. “Surely you would argue it must be illegal.”\nAttenborough has faced some criticism in the past for not going far enough with his messaging around the climate crisis. His response has been that repeated warnings about human destruction of the natural world can be a “turn-off” for viewers and his role was not to campaign but to tell “gripping and truthful” wildlife stories.\nScholey says Attenborough’s role as a storyteller, rather than campaigner, has helped people understand the natural world.\n“What David has succeeded at doing is remaining trusted by everyone, so that when he plays his cards, he can affect things in a huge way.”\nAs he approaches 100 years on the planet, Attenborough tells viewers of the film, two years in the making, that it is the seas that cover more than 70% of our planet that should be the focus of our concern: “I now understand that the most important place on Earth is not on land but at sea,” he says. “We are at a crossroads, with humanity draining the life from the ocean.”\nThe documentary’s mission, says Scholey, is to highlight the UN’s upcoming Ocean Conference in Nice, in June, where it is hoped a plan for ocean protection can be reached. Member states have agreed in principle to protect 30% of the world’s oceans from destructive fishing by 2030, as part of an agreement to stop biodiversity loss. Attenborough’s message is that this target needs more action.\nScholey compares the rise of industrial fishing with commercial whaling, both of which have driven species “to the point of collapse”.\nAmid the anti-whaling protests of the 1970s and 80s, it was thought whale populations, some hunted to the brink of extinction, might never recover. But an agreement by the International Whaling Commission in 1982 stopped commercial whaling, and species are now thriving.\n“Success is possible,” Attenborough attests from the deck of a vessel, as a blue whale swims alongside. “I’ve seen it on a global scale once before.”\nToby Nowlan, one of Ocean’s three directors, who also produced it, says: “There is an element of wake-up call, but really it’s a story of hope and recovery.”\nThe film shows inspirational stories of ocean recovery in places where destructive fishing is banned, including off the Isle of Arran, Scotland, and Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, Hawaii.\n“The ocean can recover faster than we can ever imagine: it can bounce back to life,” says Attenborough.\nOcean will be available on Hulu and Disney+ later this year"

    "raw_text": "Perched on a quay in the Cornish port of Falmouth is Pysk fishmongers, where Giles and Sarah Gilbert started out with a dream to supply locally caught seafood to the town. Their catch comes mainly from small boats that deliver a glittering array of local fish: gleaming red mullets, iridescent mackerels, spotted dabs and bright white scallops, still snapping in their shells.\nOccasionally, they will get a treasured haul of local common prawns – stripy, smaller and sweeter than the frozen, imported varieties in UK supermarkets. So, when customers come into the shop asking for prawns, Giles Gilbert presents “these bouncing jack-in-a-boxes” with a flourish, hoping to tempt buyers with the fresh, live shellfish.\n“I think most people are absolutely fascinated,” he says. “But they’ll say, ‘Have you got anything a bit bigger than that?’ or, ‘I wanted something that was already cooked.’”\nTime and again, Gilbert finds himself rummaging around in the freezer to retrieve an emergency bag of imported shellfish, lest he lose a loyal customer.\nIt’s not just prawns. “We have access to some incredible fish, but it stays on the counter because what people are looking for is cod or salmon, when there’s this immaculate fish that’s been caught maybe an hour ago,” he says.\n“It’s frustrating when we’ve developed relationships with fishermen and we can’t take their entire catch.”\nThe UK is perhaps unfairly stereotyped as a nation with an unadventurous palate. But where seafood is concerned, that’s backed up by the data. There are more than 300 species in the UK’s coastal waters, and British people eat strikingly little of it.\nAccording to Seafish, the UK public body supporting the industry, the UK’s “big five” – cod, pollack, salmon, tuna and prawns – comprise 62% of seafood consumed in Britain (though the Marine Stewardship Council names the big five as cod, haddock, salmon, tuna and prawns, and reckons they make up 80% of fish and seafood eaten in the UK when consumption outside the home, in restaurants and in fish ‘n’ chip shops is included).\nMost of what is eaten in the UK is imported, while the majority of what is fished in British waters is sent elsewhere.\nIt’s not just the UK. In the European Union, cod, pollack, salmon, tuna and prawns account for 44% of consumption. In the US, as well as these five, the 10 most popular species include tilapia, clams and catfish, accounting for 76% of seafood.\nOur global eating patterns increasingly tend towards fewer and larger species, consumed further from where they are caught.\nThose dietary choices fuel problems such as overfishing, resource-intensive fish farms, higher greenhouse-gas emissions, and tonnes of fish waste. The percentage of populations fished at biologically unsustainable levels is increasing worldwide, according to a recent UN report, while our appetite for seafood is also likely to grow.\nThe picture appears bleak – and yet, if selected and consumed carefully, seafood provides a powerful opportunity to improve the environmental impact of our diets overall.\n“Seafood can be, and in some situations is being, produced very sustainably, especially when compared to other terrestrial animal-source foods,” says Jessica Gephart, an expert in the globalisation of aquatic food at the University of Washington.\nWhat’s on our plates – and why?\nSo, can we shift our diehard eating habits towards new fish? And why do we prefer cod over cockles, and salmon rather than sole? It’s a complex global picture, starting with the UK, where people once ate a wider variety of seafood, including an abundance of sprats, herring and whelks. Essex University led research published last year that offered clues about why these patterns have changed.\nFrom the early 1900s, industrialised fishing fuelled the expansion of British boats beyond inshore waters into plentiful northern seas, where they began scooping up several hundreds of thousands tonnes of haddock and cod. Cue the spread of fish ’n’ chip shops, which found a convenient vehicle for their batter in these large, filleted and less bony fish.\nAfter 1973, when the UK joined the European Economic Community, British boats lost access to more distant fishing grounds and became confined to inshore waters, where those big white fish were less abundant. But by this point, the national preference for haddock and cod was entrenched, and the UK began importing these species to fill the deficit.\n“So the situation we’re in today is that we import a lot of the seafood that we consume, including those ‘big five’ species, and we export most of what we land,” says Luke Harrison, who led the Essex University study. In fact, between 1975 and 2019, the share of British fish consumed by the UK public dropped from 89% to 40%, his research showed.\nOur palates have also been dulled by how we shop. Jack Clarke, seafood engagement manager at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), says: “The homogenisation of our diet, especially around seafood, is probably due to our over-reliance on supermarkets.”\nBig chains need to secure large and consistent supplies of easily processable seafood, which usually creates a bias towards a smaller number of fish from bigger species that are caught by larger fisheries, he says. This could increase pressure on wild stocks or push retailers towards species raised in fish farms.\nThe simplifying effect of our globalised food system is most obvious in wealthy countries. Anna Sturrock, an aquatic ecologist at Essex University, and a co-author of the study, says: “We can afford these imports. That’s probably the main reason it hasn’t changed: we’ve got a taste for it, and it’s always been available to us.”\nThat is echoed in the US, where prawns make up more than 30% of Americans’ annual consumption of seafood. About 90% are imported from countries such as Indonesia and India, where the farming of prawns has been implicated in labour abuses and the destruction of mangroves. Yet US-caught prawns met half of the national demand in the 1980s.\nEven as one of the top six seafood producers worldwide, the US imports about 65% of what it consumes. “US seafood consumption is dominated by a few species,” says Gephart. “A significant share of that also comes from canned and processed forms, like frozen breaded patties.”\nResearch by Seafish shows that convenience is a key driver of consumer choices in Britain, and our impoverished palates as a result may help explain why we have lost our taste for kippers and turn up our noses at the mussels that are abundant off UK shores.\nDavid Willer, at Cambridge University, has researched underexploited seafood, such as mussels. “We’ve done lots of research on that, and it’s mostly down to convenience and ease of preparation, and a kind of ‘yuck’ factor,” he says.\nIn India, another top global producer of fish, tropical waters support a great diversity of species, but in lower quantities. As Divya Karnad, a marine geographer and conservationist at Ashoka University, near Delhi, explains, that means a fisher who catches 100 local fish is likely to have several dozen species in his net.\n“Historically, coastal India had ways of dealing with this, either by having recipes specifically for different fish, or having a generic recipe in which they could add many species,” she says.\nBut with an increasingly urbanised population in India, she adds: “People don’t have enough time to handle their food. So instead of cleaning hundreds of small fish, if you can get a fillet then you will choose that.”\nKarnad’s research has drawn a link between this more selective diet and overfishing. Picture that fisherman hauling in his catch of 100 diverse fish, she says. “But now, he’s able to sell only 15. So he has to go out that many more times to actually make up the cost.”\nShe also believes there is an aspirational quality attached to some fish species, such as Norwegian salmon, which is now in demand among wealthy people. This fish is now ubiquitous globally, says Shakuntala Haraksingh Thilsted, director for nutrition, health and food security impact area plarform at CGIAR, the world’s largest global agricultural innovation network.\nThilsted, the 2021 recipient of the World Food Prize, found salmon on sale even in the diverse seafood markets of Thailand. Japan did not use salmon in sushi a few decades ago but now it’s everywhere, she says, swaddled in blankets of sticky rice.\n“That has something to do with the power of the private market – that foods that are considered desirable, aspirational, have moved across borders,” Thilsted says.\nWhat should be on our plates?\nHow do we begin to disentangle these patterns to eat more sustainably? There is no magic bullet for something as complicated as seafood, says Sturrock at Essex University, adding: “When we think about sustainability, it’s not just about overfishing, it’s also about how far we bring it from different places, and the impact of that fishery, or the aquaculture type, on the local environment.”\nThere is also the issue of fish waste as well as social factors – labour rights, fishers’ livelihoods – embedded in our choice of fish.\nAnd there are trade-offs. A local, small-scale fishery may still be putting pressure on a delicate population, while a more distant fishery might have higher carbon emissions but be exploiting a more stable population.\nEven farmed salmon, with all its problems, is not so clearcut when emissions from its production are lower than those associated with chicken, and improvements in breeding and feed are bringing those emissions down further, says Gephart, at the University of Washington. This can make sustainable eating feel like a game of Whac-A-Mole. “It is really hard and unreasonable to put that on consumers,” she says.\nGovernments do need to make better decisions about where and what is fished, and how to support fishers to work more sustainably in a difficult industry. However, “that doesn’t mean that we should throw up our hands and say that ‘seafood is bad, it’s all too complicated’,” Gephart says.\n“It’s about how we signal our values for sustainable production, so that we can lean on industry and governments.”\nClarke, at the MCS, suggests getting guidance on what populations are green-rated, or to find alternatives, from sources such as its own Good Fish Guide or Seafood Watch, produced by the US not-for-profit organisation Monterey Bay Aquarium.\nFor instance, for those wanting a change from salmon, which makes up almost a third of all fish eaten in the UK, farmed trout has fewer pollution issues and also uses less fish in the feed, Clarke says. “And they’re really tasty, with a similar flavour profile to salmon, and just as simple to cook.”\nIf you live close to a fishmonger, tap into their knowledge too, he adds. They will also have a more diverse array of fish than most supermarkets.\n“If we make room for diverse foods on the plate, then we will be getting closer to the goals we aspire to,” says Thilsted. Eating a wider variety of fish takes pressure off certain populations, and shift our diets towards smaller species that are green-rated, such as herrings and sardines, which can be eaten whole, thereby helping tackle fish waste.\nIt also shifts the spotlight on to shellfish and bivalves such as mussels. If there is one seafood with almost universal environmental credibility, this is it, says Gephart, whose research shows that of all aquatic foods, farmed mussels and seaweeds have the lowest environmental impact. Together, they can create refuges for ocean species, while mussels also have protein levels similar to beef.\nThe challenge now is increasing consumer demand, says Willer, at Cambridge University. He is working with the food industry on innovative projects to make mussels, for instance, more palatable to the British public.\nOthers are taking the more futuristic leap into lab-grown seafood to relieve pressure on overfished populations. Meanwhile, others are working to build sustainability across the wider industry. In India, Karnad set up InSeason Fish, which works with restaurants to raise awareness of fish to avoid and to promote alternatives, depending on the region and month.\n“We realised that in culinary institutes in India, chefs were not being trained with indigenous ingredients. They were instead learning about French cuisine,” says Karnad, whose organisation trains chefs in how to prepare India’s diverse fish. It has also brought in local fishers directly to advise chefs on the incoming catch and procure what they need.\nIn another attempt to diversify menus, a British company called CH&Co, which caters for venues including schools, hospices, and offices, is focused on reducing the use of the big five. They provide their clients with data about the proportion of big five species that they are buying, and then take steps to educate and challenge their culinary teams to reduce the use of these fish.\nAs a result, “chefs are putting more diverse species at the centre of menus and working to change customer attitudes to what fish species should appear on a plate”, says Clare Clark, the head of sustainability at CH&Co.\nThe changing face of sustainable seafood has provided new ways to “vote with your wallet”, says Jack Clarke, adding: “It really does have an effect.”\nIn Cornwall, Gilbert is seeing people doing exactly that. In a recent experiment, he displayed three types of scallops on his fish counter, each with the catch method and sustainability information supplied alongside the price. To his surprise, he found customers preferred the most expensive but sustainable hand-dived scallops.\nHe may not have won them over on the local prawns yet. But he senses that the tide is turning: “We just seem to have more and more interest in what we’re doing here.”"

    "raw_text": "Built like a torpedo, weighing more than a male polar bear when fully grown and fetching prices in Japan of more than £2m for a single fish, the bluefin tuna was once an abundant apex predator in British waters. In the 1960s, these warm-blooded aquatic hunters disappeared – pushed to the brink of extinction in the eastern Atlantic by overfishing.\nBut since 2014, the enormous migratory fish have returned in their thousands off the coast of south-west England after deep cuts to fishing quotas in the eastern Atlantic to revive the species. Nobody is really sure why they are back in such great numbers – with populations also recovering in the Mediterranean, where the vast majority are caught – but bluefin tuna is no longer listed as an endangered species in the UK, and is now often spotted hunting close to shore by wildlife photographers. With its return, minds have also turned to how to catch it without causing it to vanish from British waters again.\nAt the end of 2023, the UK concluded its first commercial bluefin fishing season in more than 60 years. Now, as a three-year tag-and-release trial to study the impact of sports fishing comes to an end, scientists are cautiously celebrating a “remarkable” resurgence for the fish, signalling hope not just for the bluefin tuna, but also for coastal communities that once relied on it.\n“When I was younger, you’d occasionally hear of a bluefin being caught by a commercial fleet. Now, they are here in their thousands. Thousands and thousands. We get a good run of anchovies, sardines, mackerel and herring. The tuna are here feeding on them,” says Chris Gill, the skipper of the Aquila in Mevagissey, Cornwall, who has been participating in the tag-and-release programme, where the fish are tagged and returned to the water, and the first commercial fishery season.\nThe programme allowed 10 boats to catch 39 tonnes, amounting to a few hundred fish.\nThe government has announced plans to introduce a catch-and-release fishery from 2024, after the successful tagging programme to better understand the creatures in anticipation of a regulated industry, giving more anglers the chance to catch the enormous fish in British waters for the first time in generations.\nDuring the programme, more than 3,000 bluefin tuna were tagged over 1,647 fishing trips between 2021 and 2023, according to new figures released to the Guardian. A socioeconomic study of the scheme estimates that it gave a £2.6m economic boost across the bluefin-fishing season, which runs from mid-August to mid-December. Gill says the scheme has given anglers a chance to catch the fish of a lifetime – while paving the way for a sustainable future industry.\n“I’ve had a pair of 11-year-old twins out with their dad catching bluefin tuna. They both had a 320-pound fish. I had a 76-year-old with lung cancer come out because it’s one of those bucket-list fish,” he says.\nConservation groups have urged the government to tread lightly. “The success of the [tag-and-release] programme shows us that when advice from scientists, recreational anglers, skippers and conservationists is followed and we treat our seas right, species can stage a remarkable return,” says Dr Kenneth Bodles, the head of fisheries and aquaculture at the Marine Conservation Society. “As we witness this resurgence of bluefin tuna in the UK, it’s crucial that we proceed with utmost care, adopting careful management and continued monitoring that honours the fragile balance of our seas and respects this iconic species.”\nThe catch-and-release scheme, known as Chart, has been praised by environmental groups, but the return of commercial fishing has not been popular with everyone. Rick Stein’s Padstow restaurant was criticised by wildlife campaigners after staff posted a video of the preparation of a fish caught under the trial, serving it seared with guacamole and a soy dressing. No decision has been made about how the UK’s bluefin quota will be used for the commercial scheme in 2024, but British tuna is expected to stay on the menu.\nStein is not the only chef to have embraced the fish’s return. Despite high prices in Japan – which are part of a modern custom of auctioning the first fish of the season – prices for British bluefin tuna ranged from £4 to £17 for a kilogram last year for sales to high-end restaurants, said Gill, with the entire fish delivered in the back of a transit van. The fish are also very difficult to freeze: to preserve the celebrated deep red colour, you will need a freezer that can get to -60C. For those buying local Cornish bluefin from the fishmonger, it costs around £20-£50 for a steak.\nThe Michelin-starred chef and restaurateur Mike Robinson, who co-owns Harwood Arms in Fulham, says he put Cornish bluefin tuna on the menu again after careful consideration of its sustainability credentials. He bought fish that Gill had caught under the scheme.\nThe tuna, he says, “was exquisite”.\n“We used every bit of it. It was 100kg in gutted weight. That is a bloody big fish. To put it in perspective, they grow to 500kg in size or more. The only way they can grow to that size is if they have sufficient food, so the good news is they must be finding it,” he says, explaining that he has been out at sea to observe the tuna in large shoals.\n“The most important thing is that it is not abused,” he said, raising concerns about reports of fishing boats heading to the west coast of Ireland to wait in international waters. “It’s very hard to police. Hopefully, this resource won’t be hammered by people outside our control,” says Robinson.\n-\nFind more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on X for all the latest news and features"

    "raw_text": "In a year of record-breaking temperatures and marine heatwaves threatening our already depleted seas, conservationists, supermarkets and even musicians, including Icelandic singer Björk, have spoken out over dwindling wild fish populations.\nOceana, a US-based NGO, reported that half of Britain’s largest wild fish populations, including North Sea cod, are either overfished or in a critical state; supermarkets criticised the UK, Norway and EU for failure to reach agreement over sustainable mackerel fishing; and Blue Marine Foundation, another charity, is taking the UK government to court for “illegally squandering” fish populations by ignoring scientific advice on those shared with the EU and Norway.\nThe welfare of farmed fish, as well as the impact of the fish farming industry, has also taken a hit. The naturalist and broadcaster Chris Packham called for a halt to the “catastrophic” expansion of the Scottish salmon farming industry, as the Guardian revealed farmed salmon mortality was at record levels. Most salmon bought in UK supermarkets are farmed.\nAnd earlier this month, an expert assessment of wild fish populations found nearly a quarter at risk of extinction, with wild Atlantic salmon increasingly threatened.\nSo, what are the fish to ditch in 2024 and what should we eating?\n“Unsustainable seafood is one of the biggest threats to our seas,” says Charlotte Coombes, good fish guide manager at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). The guide’s latest edition, in October, awarded only one in eight UK fish the highest “green” status and considered only 13% a sustainable choice.\nConsumers should ask “what, where and how”, says Coombes – what species, where it was caught and how. A simple start, she suggests, would be to swap the “big five” for other seafood.\nBritons eat, on average, one serving of fish a week, 80% of which is made up of just five species. Cod and haddock, the staple of fish and chip dinners, is the most common choice, followed by salmon, tuna and prawns.\nA simple “swap” would reduce the pressure on this handful of preferred favourites, Coombes says, reducing the demand that drives unsustainable fishing and farming practices.\nSwap shop – what to buy instead of the big five\n1. Cod\nOne of the UK’s favourites, cod is a cold water species, generally wild-caught, but they have been struggling as sea temperatures rise. UK populations are doing very badly and should be avoided, MCS says. The good news is, North Sea populations are starting to increase due to fishing restrictions, but the stock is not yet sustainable.\nSustainable swap Hake, certified by the Marine Stewardship Council’s (MSC) blue tick, is now a sustainable choice, thanks to good management and environmental conditions, says the MCS guide.\n2. Haddock\nAlso a chip shop favourite, haddock is generally a sustainable, wild-caught fish. But some populations are running low and haddock often swim in the same waters as cod, leading to haddock fisheries catching both species. Avoid fish less than 30cm in length and buying fresh during the March and April breeding season, MCS says.\nBest choice Haddock from the North Sea, Scotland, Iceland or Norway, or MSC-certified.\nSustainable swap Plaice from the North Sea, where populations are thriving.\n3. Salmon\nWild Atlantic salmon populations are 23% down globally and have vanished from many UK rivers. The species has been affected by widespread habitat loss, global heating and dams. Breeding with escaped farmed salmon also threatens many wild populations. Sea lice from salmon farms are also a problem. Wild Atlantic salmon is now classified as “near threatened”, and should be avoided, according to the fish guide.\nBest choice Pacific wild salmon (pink, red or keta) from Alaska. Organic or salmon certified by a green tick from the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, MCS says.\nSustainable swap Farmed rainbow trout from UK ponds is a good alternative, MCS says.\n4. Tuna\nThis top predator can grow up to three metres in length. There are many different species and MCS recommends checking its Good Fish Guide to see which are more sustainable. Avoid Pacific and Southern bluefin tuna, Indian Ocean yellowfin and tuna caught by gillnets or drift nets.\nBest choice Skipjack or albacore tuna caught by pole and line or trolls, artificial lures on barb-free lines with minimal bycatch.\nSustainable swap Sardines from south-west England.\n5. Prawns\nSourced from all over the world, prawns can be sustainable, depending on species, where and how they are caught.\nBest choice Wild cold-water prawns from the north-east Arctic. Farmed prawns labelled organic or with an MSC or ASC label, according to the fish guide. Creel-caught Scottish langoustines.\nAvoid Uncertified farmed king and tiger prawns from Vietnam, Indonesia or India.\nSustainable swap Mussels: UK, rope-grown mussels are among the most ocean-friendly seafood, the fish guide says."

    "raw_text": "A coalition of British seafood companies and retailers, including Young’s, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Aldi and Waitrose, has condemned the “collective failure” of the UK, Norway and other states to reach agreement on the sustainable fishing of mackerel in the north-east Atlantic.\nLack of political agreement over a decade has led to an “overfishing disaster of potentially epic proportions”, conservationists say, leading to 44% more fish being caught than is sustainable.\nThe £1bn industry, the most economically important for the region, is being overexploited due to repeated failures of states to ensure the total catch is in line with scientific advice, say the coalition, the North Atlantic Pelagic Advocacy Group (Napa). Many members, including Youngs, have threatened to stop sourcing from the fisheries if sustainable management is not achieved.\nThis year, the Marine Conservation Society downgraded the sustainability rating of north-east Atlantic mackerel in its Good Fish Guide because of overexploitation. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) withdrew its blue-tick assurance of sustainability in 2019 for the same reason.\n“This is a collective failure by the coastal states,” said Neil Auchterlonie, project lead for Napa, a coalition of 50 retailers and suppliers set up in 2019 after MSC certification was lost. “There is a real frustration around the fact that there is no movement on this.”\nAt a meeting of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission this week, Napa called for urgent agreement or a binding dispute resolution mechanism to be put in place.\nWhile the countries agree in principle to the total catch limits set by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the scientific body that advises governments, their lack of agreement on quota allocation has meant states have set quotas unilaterally and these limits are exceeded.\nLast month, Napa wrote an open letter to government ministers in the UK, EU, Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Russia, urging them to “stop overfishing” and come to a “sustainable and unanimous” agreement on mackerel, herring and blue whiting quotas for 2024.\nBut, after consultations between all the states with the exception of Russia, they released a statement regretting they “had not yet been able to come to an agreement, despite having made some good progress” and would reconvene by early 2024.\nCharles Clover, author and co-founder of the Blue Marine Foundation, said: “This is an overfishing disaster of potentially epic proportions and they are all looking the other way.” He said it reflected badly on all nations, including the UK, which could “lead by example and declare a lower quota”.\n“Instead, the UK has negotiated some irresponsibly set quota off Norway and given it to some of the richest people in the fishing business, while the rest of the industry is in decline. Huge fortunes are being made out of fishing the stock irresponsibly.”\nErin Priddle, regional director for the Marine Stewardship Council in north Europe, said: “You can’t keep fishing above what the science says and expect things to be OK. Fish stocks are susceptible to crashes, as we’ve seen with the collapse of the cod stocks off the Grand Banks in the 90s, or the collapse of herring in the 60s.”\nA Defra spokesperson said: “We have exercised considerable restraint in our approach to the long-term management of mackerel stock, setting our quota at levels considerably lower than the stock in our waters and taking a science-based but pragmatic approach throughout the recent coastal state consultations.”\n“We will continue to work closely with other coastal states to secure a quota-sharing arrangement.”"

    "raw_text": "Annual short-term moratoriums on squid fishing imposed by Chinese authorities are probably meaningless as there appeared to be little fishing activity in the areas before the bans were announced, analysis has claimed.\nIn 2020, China’s ministry of agriculture and rural affairs announced a pilot program banning fishing in parts of the south-west Atlantic Ocean from July to October, and parts of the eastern Pacific Ocean from September to December.\n“During the period, all Chinese fishing boats in the area will suspend operations,” the ministry said.\nHowever, an analysis by the conservation group Oceana suggested the moratoriums may have made little difference because the areas chosen were not typically fished by Chinese fleets anyway. In the south-west Atlantic moratorium area, Oceana found there had been no fishing conducted by Chinese fleets in the same time period in 2019. Between 1,800 and 8,500 fishing hours were detected in the zone in each of the five years to 2019. In the eastern Pacific zone, China’s fishing fleet appeared to fish only 38 hours in the year before the ban’s introduction.\n“Ending squid fishing in areas where there is no fishing does nothing to protect squid,” said Oceana’s campaign director, Max Valentine.\nChina is the largest producer of distant water fishing stock in the world, and the largest catcher of squid, according to a 2020 study. It is reportedly responsible for half of all high seas squid fishing. In the first six months of this year, China conducted more than 330,000 hours of squid fishing.\n“I think moratoriums are really great – it’s just like a marine protected area and stocks can rebound,” said Valentine.\n“Unfortunately with these particular bans, they’re not in areas where crews particularly fish. We’re not seeing [bans] off the coast of Argentina or Peru where the Chinese fleets have fished for over a decade.”\nChinese authorities have said the moratorium areas are breeding grounds for squid, and bans will allow populations to rebound. However, Valentine said squid were highly migratory, and any areas purporting to protect breeding grounds would need to be much larger.\nIn recent years China has announced a number of measures purported to control the level of fishing its fleet conducts, including announcing caps on fishing boats in Chinese waters in 2021, and in five squid fishing grounds across the Pacific and Indian oceans in 2022. Under the government’s 13th five-year plan, spanning 2016 to 2020, China aimed to reduce its fishing fleet and total catch to 10m tonnes. The 14th plan aims to stick to the 10m tonnes cap, while continuing to reduce the number of large and medium-sized vessels.\nHowever, environmental groups have expressed scepticism over the effectiveness and transparency of China’s efforts. A 2022 analysis of China’s squid fishing industry within Chinese waters found its ocean haul fell briefly from 2018 to 2019, but has since continued to rise. Under-reporting of catches in international waters and suspected acts of illegal fishing are common.\nOceana analysed automatic identification system (AIS) data from Global Fishing Watch (GFW), which relies on Chinese fishing vessels having the AIS tracking turned on and operating. In recent years there have been some major incidents of fishing vessels “going dark”, including within exclusive economic zone around the ecologically sensitive Galapagos Islands.\nThere are widespread concerns about global overfishing, and issues with existing reporting mechanisms, including in the European Union. Sustainable management of the oceans could lead to six times more food production, previous research has found, but current practices threaten to wipe out entire species.\nOceana called for governments to demand increased transparency at sea and traceability of imported seafood.\nAdditional research by Chi Hui Lin"

    "raw_text": "It has been almost two decades in the making, but late on Saturday night in New York, after days of gruelling round-the-clock talks, UN member states finally agreed on a treaty to protect the high seas.\nA full day after the deadline for talks had officially passed, the conference president, Rena Lee of Singapore, took to the floor of room 2 of the UN headquarters in New York and announced that the treaty had been agreed. At a later date, the delegates will meet for half a day to formally adopt the text. She made it clear the text would not be reopened.\n“In Singapore, we like to go on learning journeys, and this has been the learning journey of a lifetime,” Lee said.\nShe thanked delegates for their dedication and commitment. “The success is also yours,” she told them.\nShe received cheers and a standing ovation from delegates in the room who had not left the conference hall for two days and worked through the night in order to get the deal done.\nThe historic treaty is crucial for enforcing the 30x30 pledge made by countries at the UN biodiversity conference in December, to protect a third of the sea (and land) by 2030. Without a treaty, this target would certainly fail, as until now no legal mechanism existed to set up MPAs on the high seas.\nCovering almost two-thirds of the ocean that lies outside national boundaries, the treaty will provide a legal framework for establishing vast marine protected areas (MPAs) to protect against the loss of wildlife and share out the genetic resources of the high seas. It will establish a conference of the parties (Cop) that will meet periodically and enable member states to be held to account on issues such as governance and biodiversity.\nOcean ecosystems produce half the oxygen we breathe, represent 95% of the planet’s biosphere and soak up carbon dioxide, as the world’s largest carbon sink. Yet until now, fragmented and loosely enforced rules governing the high seas have rendered this area more susceptible than coastal waters to exploitation.\nVeronica Frank, political adviser for Greenpeace, said that while the organisation hadn’t seen the latest text, “We are really happy. The world is so divided and to see multilateralism supported is so important.\n“What’s really important is now to use this tool to develop this 30x30 target into force really quickly.”\nThe Pew Charitable Trust welcomed the “landmark international agreement”.\n“High seas marine protected areas can play a critical role in the impacts of climate change,” said Liz Karan, director of Pew’s ocean governance project. “Governments and civil society must now ensure the agreement is adopted and rapidly enters into force and is effectively implemented to safeguard high seas biodiversity.”\nThe High Ambition Coalition – which includes the EU, US, UK and China – were key players in brokering the deal, building coalitions instead of sowing division and showing willingness to compromise in the final days of talks. The Global South led the way in ensuring the treaty could be put into practice in a fair and equitable way.\nThe European commissioner for the environment, ocean and fisheries, Virginijus Sinkevičius, described the agreement as a “historic moment for the ocean” and the culmination of more than a decade of work and international negotiations.\n“With the agreement on the UN High Seas Treaty, we take a crucial step forward to preserve the marine life and biodiversity that are essential for us and the generations to come,” he said. “It is also a proof of strengthened multilateral cooperation with our partners and a major asset to implement our COP 15 goal for 30% ocean protection. I am very proud of our outcome.”\nMichael Imran Kanu, the head of the African Group and ambassador and deputy permanent representative to the UN for legal affairs of Sierra Leone, said the treaty was “robust and ambitious”. Kanu, who expressed concerns during talks over the fair and equitable sharing of benefits, said: “We really achieved amazing results” on this issue. Monetary and non-monetary benefits would be shared and an initial upfront fund would be set up under the treaty. He welcomed the adoption of the “common heritage of humankind” as a key principle for the high seas, which was a red line for many developing states. “That was significant for us”, he said.\nIt is the third time in less than a year that member states have hunkered down in the UN’s headquarters in New York to thrash out a “final” deal. The negotiations, which ran over two weeks from 20 February were the fifth round of talks after earlier negotiations ended last August without agreement.\nThat an agreement was reached between 193 nations at all, was a huge achievement, but conservationists say it leaves significant scope for improvement. In particular, countries agreed that existing bodies already responsible for regulating activities such as fisheries, shipping and deep-sea mining could continue to do so without having to carry out environmental impact assessments laid out by the treaty.\nOne of the key stumbling blocks, which divided developing and developed nations, was how to fairly share marine genetic resources (MGR) and the eventual profits. MGR, which consist of the genetic material of deep-sea marine sponges, krill, corals, seaweeds and bacteria, are attracting increasing scientific and commercial attention due to their potential use in medicines and cosmetics.\nOthers sticking points included the procedure for creating marine protected areas and the model for environmental impact studies of planned activities on the high seas.\nIn a move seen as an attempt to build trust between rich and poor countries, the European Union pledged €40m ($42m) in New York to facilitate the ratification of the treaty and its early implementation.\nMonica Medina, the US assistant secretary for oceans, international environment and scientific affairs, who attended the negotiations in New York, said: “We leave here with the ability to create protected areas in the high seas and achieve the ambitious goal of conserving 30% of the ocean by 2030. And the time to start is now.”\nShe said the US was pleased to agree on the major element of a high seas treaty that includes a strong, coordinated approach to establishing marine protected areas.\nRebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance, said: “Following a two-week-long rollercoaster of a ride of negotiations and superhero efforts in the last 48 hours, governments reached agreement on key issues that will advance protection and better management of marine biodiversity in the high seas.”\n“What happens on the high seas will no longer be ‘out of sight, out of mind,” said Jessica Battle of WWF in a statement after leading the group’s team at the negotiations. “We can now look at the cumulative impacts on our ocean in a way that reflects the interconnected blue economy and the ecosystems that support it.”"

    "raw_text": "Animal campaigners say time is running out for the dolphin population off France’s west coast and are calling on the government to ban fishing in areas where the animals are at risk.\nA record number of dead dolphins have washed up on the country’s Atlantic beaches in the last month, but activists believe this is only a fraction of those being injured and killed by fishing boats.\nScientists at the Pelagis sea mammal and bird observatory, attached to the University of La Rochelle, recorded 370 dead dolphins found along the Gulf of Gascony between 1 December and 25 January.\n“Without any doubt, being entangled in fishing gear remains the principal cause of death observed in common dolphins found in winter strandings on beaches, and has been since the 1990s,” Pelagis reported.\n“This situation is worrying and not specific to France as it affects neighbouring countries.”\nThe warning came as the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd France published photos showing the body of a dolphin mutilated with a homophobic message that washed up on a French beach at Sables d’Olonne.\n“This is the worst face of fishing: no respect for the living, no love for the sea that sustains them. Those who atrociously mutilated this dolphin should never be allowed to fish again,” Sea Shepherd France said.\nLast year 669 dolphins were found on French beaches, most from mid-December to early April, during the hake and sea bass fishing season.\nOlivier van Canneyt, head of monitoring at Pelagis, said excess dolphin deaths had been “recurrent and very high” since 2016 and had started “especially early” this winter.\nLamya Essemlali, president of Sea Shepherd France, said the number of dolphins washing up on beaches was “the tip of the iceberg” and the toll could be many times higher.\n“The large majority of the dolphins captured and freed then drown at sea and their bodies sink,” Essemlali added.\n“It is urgent that we close certain zones to fishing boats during certain periods. We keep asking for this, but the fishing lobby is powerful in France and the government has refused. It’s extremely frustrating.\n“The only thing we can do is display the dead and mutilated dolphins to local people and to the press and make people realise what is happening.”\nSea Shepherd France, which estimates the true mortality rate of dolphins off the west coast could be as many as 11,000 out of a population of 180,000-200,000, recently launched Operation Dolphin Bycatch for the sixth year running to track and monitor fishing boats in the area. Its team is filming dolphins caught in nets to raise public awareness of the killings.\n“Let’s remind the state, which is committed to protecting marine mammals, and the fishers responsible for these massacres, that marine life does not belong to them and that the survival of all of us and that of future generations depends on our ability to preserve it,” Sea Shepherd France said in a statement.\nThe International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which coordinates research of the north-east Atlantic marine environment, has also urged the French government to order a suspension of certain non-selective fishing practices – a measure strongly opposed by fishers.\nEssemlali added: “Our aim isn’t to stop all fishing, only in certain zones and for a particular period, and for the fishers to receive financial compensation for not fishing in closed zones. That is the urgent solution.\n“In the medium term, we need a complete review of fishing methods to ensure they are as selective as possible. The government has a responsibility to protect endangered species. We are not asking them to be nice to dolphins but to respect the law.\n“The threat is real and now. The moment we see a signification drop in the dolphin population it will already be too late and scientists tell us they are already seeing signs of this. The situation cannot continue. It is unsustainable and we are running out of time.”"

    "raw_text": "European fishing fleets have been illegally netting tuna from dwindling stocks in the Indian Ocean, according to data presented to EU authorities and analysed by expert groups.\nEU purse seine (a type of large net) fishing vessels were present in the waters of Indian Ocean coastal states, where they were likely to have carried out unauthorised catches, and have reported catches in the Chagos archipelago marine protected area and in Mozambique’s exclusive economic zone.\nTwo investigations were made of fishing in the Indian Ocean, one conducted by the group OceanMind and another by the charity Blue Marine Foundation along with Kroll, the corporate investigation company. The first report found evidence, from the publicly available data published by the EU from its fishing fleet from 2016 to 2020, that EU vessels fished in the region, where the main catches include the skipjack, bigeye and yellowfin tuna species. Blue Marine Foundation subsequently established that the vessels were not authorised.\nThe second report, by Blue Marine Foundation and Kroll, examined data from ships’ monitoring software, called the automatic identification system (AIS), and found that some vessels in the region had switched it off, which could be an indication of unauthorised fishing.\nPopulations of tuna are under increasing pressure as industrialised fishing fleets cash in on the growing market for the popular fish. The expansion of tuna fisheries could lead to extinction, scientists have warned.\nThe latest NGO findings, presented to government representatives at a meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission in Seychelles this week, highlight the problem of illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) fishing around the world, and of EU vessels taking catches from the depleting stocks of developing countries.\nThe analysts also found instances where vessels had “gone dark” – turned off monitoring through the AIS, which transmits a ship’s position and is a safety tool that can also be used to ensure fishers keep within the rules – at key points, suggesting they may have engaged in IUU fishing.\nSome EU vessels in the western Indian Ocean went dark for an average of three-quarters of the period from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2019, according to the Blue Marine Foundation findings.\nThe Guardian has spoken to a person familiar with the licensing situation, who confirmed EU vessels have had no licences to fish in Somali waters since 2013. Blue Marine Foundation said the Indian authorities also confirmed they had not issued licences to EU vessels.\nAnne-France Mattlet, the tuna group director for the EU fishing trade association Europêche, said: “The EU purse seine vessels did not fish in Somalian waters.”\nAn official for the European Commission said: “The EU has a strict zero tolerance for IUU. In order to fight IUU in the IOTC convention area, the EU has also tabled a proposal to establish a high-sea boarding and inspection scheme, based on the work already done within the IOTC.\n“This would be an important tool to control better the fishing activities in the high seas and continue to fight against IUU fishing. We have also tabled a proposal to improve the traditionally weak IOTC compliance process, by putting more emphasis on the categorisation and follow-up to established situations of non-compliance.”\nThe spokesperson said fishing crews may have valid reasons for switching off their AIS technology, and that the transmission power and signal can vary from place to place.\n“[Going dark] does not imply that they fish illegally. The AIS might be switched off under certain circumstances by professional judgment of the master,” the spokesperson said. “The information given by the AIS may not be a complete picture of the situation in the area and of the vessel’s activity.”\nCharles Clover, the executive director of Blue Marine Foundation, defended its claims. “The report showing the locations of EU vessels is based on the findings of a study commissioned by Blue Marine Foundation and undertaken by OceanMind – a highly reputable organisation – which in turn was based on publicly available data reported by the EU and published by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission on its website,” he said.\n“This data shows, for example, evidence of fishing on the part of vessels flagged to Spain in the waters of Somalia, in 2017 and 2018, and India, in 2018 and 2019.”\nHe added: “There is evidence to suggest that some of these fleets are fishing in coastal states’ waters without any kind of authorisation and we call on the European Commission to investigate these instances as a matter of urgency.”\nThe Guardian also approached the Spanish government for comment."

    "raw_text": "The UK’s largest sandbank has been protected from bottom trawling, an environmentally destructive fishing technique.\nActivists have been calling on the government for years to stop bottom trawling at Dogger Bank, an important site off the east coast of England for species including sand eels, hermit crabs, flatfish and starfish.\nRecent data showed the fishing method, involving weighted nets being dragged across the seabed, had tripled in occurrence in the marine protected area (MPA) since Brexit.\nThis is despite the area being labelled an MPA. Bottom trawling happens in many of these environmentally significant areas, leading campaigners and experts to refer to them as nothing but “paper parks”. Not only does it disturb species living on the seabed, it is also a significant source of carbon release, as the seabed normally acts as a valuable sink to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, but turns into a carbon source when disturbed.\nNow, the method will be banned, with government sources referring to the new legislation as a result of “Brexit freedoms”. The four bylaws, being introduced using new powers under the 2020 Fisheries Act, will come into effect in June.\nThe environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “Outside the EU, we are using our new freedoms to protect our marine environment. We will be stopping trawling and dredging in these marine protected areas to protect wildlife and habitats, through powers we have in our Fisheries Act 2020.”\nAs well as Dogger Bank, there are three other MPAs being saved from bottom trawling. These are Inner Dowsing, Race Bank and North Ridge special area of conservation, , which lies off the south Lincolnshire coast, the South Dorset marine conservation zone and the Canyons marine conservation zone, which is in the far south-west corner of the UK’s continental shelf area.\nHowever, experts have pointed out there are 64 MPAs, most of which have few protections from destructive fishing.\nMelissa Moore, the head of UK policy at the NGO Oceana, said: “It’s good news that government has at last taken the first step to manage four of its 64 offshore benthic MPAs, given that damaging activity such as bottom trawling is prohibited in MPAs under conservation law.\n“We fully support the Dogger Bank bylaw that will protect the whole site and have benefits for the North Sea ecosystem beyond. However, the bylaw proposed for Inner Dowsing MPA is tiny and will only protect parts of the site. We call on UK to remedy this and with devolved governments to act quickly to ban bottom-towed gear in the remaining 60 offshore MPAs that they promised to manage following Oceana’s legal challenge in 2021. This is now increasingly urgent due to the climate and ecological crises.”\nGreenpeace has been campaigning for the government to stop trawling at Dogger Bank, most notably dropping rocks in the MPA to thwart trawlers. Campaigners have asked the government to use its post-Brexit powers to go further and ban destructive fishing practices in all MPAs.\nFiona Nicholls, an oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s been 18 months since Greenpeace built a protective boulder barrier in the Dogger Bank and since the government committed to stop bottom trawling in this iconic and ecologically important area. While this is a major step towards protecting some of the most environmentally significant features of the Dogger Bank, destructive industrial fishing vessels like factory trawlers will still be allowed to plunder this now partially protected area.\n“We need the government to get us on track this year to fully or highly protecting all of our marine protected areas. That means, as a starting point, banning all destructive industrial fishing vessels. This could be done using post-Brexit powers to restrict fishing licences, rather than simply relying on the cumbersome process of introducing partial site bylaw restrictions. Only then will the UK be a true world leader in marine protection, and can nature and coastal communities have a chance to recover.”"

    "raw_text": "Legal action is to be brought against all 27 EU countries over the setting of unsustainable fishing quotas for 2022, two years after a deadline to end overfishing.\nUnder the EU’s common fisheries policy, over-exploitation of fish stocks was supposed to end in 2020 but more than 40% of all commercial stocks in EU waters were unsustainably fished last year according to official monitoring data.\nThe green law group ClientEarth filed a request on Friday asking the Council of the European Union to review the catch limits set by EU fisheries ministers for the north-east Atlantic in December 2021.\nIf it is refused, the green watchdog has said it will file a case at the court of justice of the EU later this year.\n“We are taking legal action to stop EU ministers consistently allowing rampant overfishing,” said ClientEarth’s fisheries lawyer, Arthur Meeus. “These short-sighted policies are putting at risk the future of our fishing industry and the survival of coastal communities.\n“Poorly considered fisheries policy is also undermining the fragile balance of our ocean – one of the biggest carbon sinks of the planet – and its capacity to mitigate climate change. If ministers don’t follow the science and protect stocks, the price will be paid not only by fish and fishers but by all of us.”\nClientEarth’s action is being filed under new access to justice rules granted last year and marks the first time that all 27 EU fisheries ministers have been legally challenged on this issue.\nThe group is also preparing legal action against the catch limits established for shared EU and UK fish stocks that were agreed at the same time, Meeus said.\nCod stocks are in a particularly precarious position. The North Sea has lost 80% of its cod populations since the 1970s, according to official data.\nEwen Bell, the UK’s member of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (Ices) advisory committee told the Guardian that the EU’s cod quota last year was set “just over 7% higher than the scientific advice.”\nAs a result, stocks are likely to fall below the “trigger point” at which stringent action should be taken to prevent depletion, he said.\nCod populations in the North Sea, Irish Sea and particularly the Celtic Sea are all in a reduced state, Bell added. “In the Celtic Sea, under the current circumstances, the prognosis doesn’t look very good for that stock,” he said.\nThe EU’s catch limits for 2022 ignored scientific advice that no cod at all should be fished from the Celtic Sea, the ocean west of Scotland and Kattegat, according to fisheries experts.\n“The objectives of the common fisheries policy are quite clear and they were not reached by 2020,” said another marine scientist, Lisa Borges, a marine scientist who sits on the European Commission’s expert advisory board.\n“I think that many of the Tacs [total allowable catches] were set above scientific advice because of the short-term perspectives of ministers – as usual – in these negotiations,” she added. “They were under short-term pressures and there were short term costs for their industries.”\nEuropean Commission and Council of the European Union officials have been approached for comment."

    "raw_text": "The surge in the use of disposable face masks during the Covid pandemic has left a chemical timebomb that could harm humans, animals and the environment, research suggests.\nBillions of tonnes of plastic face masks created to protect people from the spread of the virus are now breaking down, releasing microplastics and chemical additives including endocrine disruptors, the research found.\nAs a result, the very equipment whose use was intended to protect people during the pandemic now poses a risk to the health of people and planet, potentially for generations.\n“This study has underlined the urgent need to rethink how we produce, use and dispose of face masks,” said Anna Bogush of Coventry University’s Centre for Agroecology, Water and Resilience, the lead author of the study.\nIt has been estimated that during the height of the coronavirus pandemic 129bn disposable face masks, mostly made from polypropylene and other plastics, were being used every month around the world.\nWith no recycling stream, most ended up either in landfill or littered in streets, parks, beaches, waterways and rural areas, where they have now begun to degrade. Recent research has reported a significant presence of disposable face masks in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.\nBogush and her co-author, Ivan Kourtchev, set out to determine how many microplastic particles were released from face masks simply sitting in water, without moving at all.\nThey left newly bought masks of several different kinds for 24 hours in flasks containing 150ml of purified water, then filtered the liquid through a membrane to see what came out.\nEvery mask examined by Bogush and Kourtchev leached microplastics, but it was the FFP2 and FFP3 masks – marketed as the gold-standard protection against the transmission of the virus – that leached the most, releasing four to six times as many.\n“The particle sizes of MPs [microplastics] varied greatly, ranging from around 10μm–2,082μm, but microplastic particles below 100μm were predominant in the water leachates,” they wrote in their paper, published in the journal Environmental Pollution.\nAnd they made an even more worrying discovery. Subsequent chemical analysis of the leachate found medical masks also released bisphenol B, an endocrine-disrupting chemical that acts like oestrogen when absorbed into the bodies of humans and animals.\nTaking into account the total amount of single-use face masks produced during the height of the pandemic, the researchers estimated they led to the release of 128-214kg of bisphenol B into the environment.\nBogush said: “We can’t ignore the environmental cost of single-use masks, especially when we know that the microplastics and chemicals they release can negatively affect both people and ecosystems. As we move forward, it’s vital that we raise awareness of these risks, support the development of more sustainable alternatives and make informed choices to protect our health and the environment.”"

    "raw_text": "Discarded masks and other items of personal protective equipment were found on nearly a third of beaches surveyed by beach-cleaning volunteers this autumn.\nThe Marine Conservation Society’s annual beach clean found items of PPE on 30% of the areas they cleaned up.\nThe most common items of pollution found in coastal areas were pieces of plastic or polystyrene, plastic takeaway cup lids, and wet wipes.\nVolunteers carried out beach cleans in 385 coastal areas in September, covering 43,958 metres of beach.\nThis year, due to the coronavirus crisis, PPE featured for the first time on the beaches surveyed. Masks and gloves were also found by volunteers in 69% of inland litter picks.\nLizzie Prior, the Great British Beach Clean coordinator at the Marine Conservation Society, said: “The amount of PPE our volunteers found on beaches and inland this year is of concern. Considering mask-wearing was only made mandatory in shops in England in late July, little more than three months before the Great British Beach Clean, the sharp increase in PPE litter should be a warning for what could be a new form of litter polluting our beaches in the future.”\nLike many other single-use items, disposable face masks and gloves posed a threat to wildlife on land and at sea, she said. Marine animals could mistake face masks and gloves for prey, filling their stomachs with materials that will not break down and could prove to be fatal. Animals also risk being tangled in the straps of face masks, with seabirds’ feet pictured recently being wrapped in the elastic strings.\nDrinks litter continues to be found on UK beaches, with an average of 30 drinks containers, caps and lids found per 100 metre of beach surveyed this year. Inland, almost all litter picks (99%) found drinks litter.\nDr Laura Foster, head of clean seas at the Marine Conservation Society, said: “This year’s data … shows just how crucial it is that Wales, England and Northern Ireland follow in the footsteps of Scotland and urgently introduce an all-inclusive deposit return scheme. The government has said it will introduce a DRS but only from 2023.\n“Despite lockdown, with many of us spending more time at home, littering in public spaces has continued unabated. Almost every single local litter pick found at least one drinks container, which is incredibly concerning. An effective deposit return scheme would take the UK one step closer to a circular economy model and drastically reduce the volume of single-use pollution in the UK’s streets, parks and on our beaches.”\nThe five most common litter items found on UK beaches\n1 Plastic and polystyrene pieces (0-50cm) – 167.2 found per 100 metre of beach surveyed\n2 Plastic and polystyrene caps and lids – 19.7\n3 Wet wipes – 17.7\n4 Cigarette stubs – 16.2\n5 Plastic string – 15.8"

    "raw_text": "Global talks to reach agreement on a treaty aimed at ending the growing scourge of plastic pollution have collapsed, with no deal agreed and no clear path forward.\nCountries worked beyond Thursday’s deadline into the night and Friday morning, but remained deadlocked on the issue that has dogged talks since they were launched, amid fervent optimism, in 2022: whether to reduce exponential growth of plastic production and place global, legally binding controls on toxic chemicals used to make plastics.\nSeveral countries expressed bitter disappointment, sadness and anger that the Geneva talks had, after the sixth and final round of negotiations, failed to reach a deal. Despite the deadlock, they said they would carry on with a resumed session in the future.\nSome NGOs called the failed talks a “blow to multilateralism”, and there was reflection among some delegates on how best to move forward: for instance, without the participation of petrostates that had obstructed the talks.\nAgnès Pannier-Runacher, France’s minister for ecological transition, said she was “disappointed” and “angry” that a handful of countries “guided by short-term financial interests” had bloked the adoption of an ambitious treaty.\nFrance, the EU and more than 100 countries, from every continent, “did everything possible” to obtain an agreement to reduce plastic production, to ban the most dangerous products and to protect human health, she said.\nEmma Hardy, the UK’s head of delegation and marine minister, said: “I’m hugely disappointed that an agreement wasn’t reached, but am extremely proud of the way the UK worked tirelessly until the end to seek an ambitious and effective treaty.”\nColombia’s delegate, Sebastián Rodríguez, said: “The negotiations were consistently blocked by a small number of states who simply don’t want an agreement.”\nTuvalu, speaking for 14 Pacific small island developing states, said: “For our islands this means that without global cooperation and state action, millions of tonnes of plastic waste will continue to be dumped in our oceans, affecting our ecosystem, food security, livelihood and culture.”\nChina’s delegation said the fight against plastic pollution was a long marathon and the temporary setback represented a new starting point to forge consensus. It urged countries to work together to offer future generations a planet without plastic pollution.\nLuis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee, wrote and presented two drafts of treaty text based on the views expressed by the countries, but representatives from 184 countries rejected both as a basis for their negotiations.\nSaudi Arabia said both drafts lacked balance, and Saudi and Kuwaiti negotiators suggested the latest proposal, presented in the early hours of Friday, took other states’ views more into account. It addressed plastic production, which they considered to be outside the scope of the treaty.\nThe Friday draft did not include a limit on plastic production but recognised that current production and consumption levels were “unsustainable” and global action was needed.\nThere was little clarity on the way forward as delegates left the UN meeting on Friday morning. But there was acknowledgment that lessons needed to be learned and a new approach was needed.\nJessika Roswall, the European commissioner for environment, said she saw the outcome of the talks as a good basis for a resumed session, but they must “be honest and learn from the process that has brought us here today”.\nDennis Clare, of Micronesia, said: “What might have collapsed is not so much the talks but the logic of continuing or concluding them in a forum with dedicated obstructionists.”\nWhile it was always difficult to negotiate shared goals in a multilateral forum with almost 200 countries, it was “especially difficult if there is no meeting of the minds on what the goals are,” he said.\nClare, who negotiated for Micronesia during the Kigali amendment t0 the Montreal treaty to control ozone-depleting chemicals, a process that took eight years, said he had “deja vu” from petrostates blocking principles back then.\n“We need to consider how to approach this and whether to consider without [petrostates’] participation,” he said. “Many ambitious countries also have great hope in China, a country that not only has a much more diverse economy than some of its petrostate allies, but also has a demonstrated interest in showing leadership to solve global problems. This is the beginning of the beginning of the world’s attempt to address plastic pollution.”\nChristina Dixon, of the Environmental Investigation Agency, said the failure to reach a deal was a “blow to multilateralism”. If talks resume they needed a “new dynamic, a new chair and empowerment for delegates to utilise the right to vote … Its going to be really difficult to keep doing the same thing again and expect a different result – that’s the definition of insanity.”\nMelissa Sky, a senior lawyer at the Center for International Environmental Law, said:“If countries hope to ever achieve a treaty that meaningfully addresses plastics pollution, they will either need to vote at the INC [Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee] or take the negotiation elsewhere”\nValdivieso said the session had merely been adjourned rather than ended. Countries and the secretariat “will be working to try to find a date and also a place” for resuming the talks, he told Agence France-Presse."

    "raw_text": "More than 200 industry lobbyists are attending the UN’s meeting to hammer out a global plastics treaty, raising fears that moves to prevent runaway plastic production may be undermined.\nThe 234 lobbyists from the oil, petrochemical and plastics industries outnumber the combined delegations of all 27 EU member states, and far exceed the number of people attending with the delegation of scientists as well as Indigenous peoples at the Geneva talks.\nThe analysis, from the Centre for International Environmental Law (Ciel), also found 19 lobbyists sit on the national delegations of Egypt, Kazakhstan, China, Iran, Chile and the Dominican Republic.\n“Fossil fuel companies are central to plastic production, as over 99% of plastics are derived from chemicals sourced from fossil fuels,” said Ximena Banegas, Ciel’s global plastics and petrochemicals campaigner. “After decades of obstruction in the climate negotiations, why would anyone think that they would suddenly show up in good faith in the plastics treaty talks?”\nThe figure was revealed on day three of a two-week resumed meeting to achieve an agreement on the vast global problem of runaway plastic production and waste. The numbers of lobbyists attending the talks has been rising steadily since the process started in 2022, alongside deepening rifts between nations.\nNegotiations stalled at what was supposed to be the fifth and final round of talks in Busan, South Korea, in December last year. The process was extended to the current round in Switzerland to give nations another chance to agree on a deal. Tensions have flared around key aspects of the proposed treaty, including calls for a production limit on plastics, managing harmful chemicals in plastics, and how the treaty’s implementation will be financed, with countries splitting into increasingly divergent camps.\nOn the one hand is a cohort of more than 100 nations that say they want an ambitious treaty including, among other things, global targets to reduce plastic production. On the other is a small group of oil and plastic-producing states including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran – the so-called “like-minded group” – that reject production limits and want the treaty to focus on downstream measures to tackle waste.\nThree days into negotiations, these separate camps seem to be further entrenched, with the United States appearing to side with the industry-friendly “like-minded group”.\n“They’re basically going full Maga,” said a source close to the talks. “They’re clearly coordinating with Saudi Arabia, Russia and others, because they’re using the same language.” Before the meeting in Geneva, the US reportedly circulated a memo among countries where it openly took a stance against production cuts. The US is the world’s second-largest plastic producer and yet last year said it supported production cuts.\nThe source also noted that the US delegation usually met environmental NGOs, scientists and industry before the talks begin, but that before the Geneva meeting they had met with industry alone.\n“Even under a Democratic administration, the US is incredibly industry-friendly, but it at least goes through the motions of consulting with its own citizenry,” they said. “That charade is gone now.”\nTwo days before Ciel’s estimate was released, the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), an industry trade body, released their own statement saying that they had 136 representatives of the plastic, petrochemical and chemical manufacturing industries present at the talks.\nReferring to their headcount, an ICCA spokesperson said: “We are significantly outnumbered by the more than 1,500 NGO participants.” However, civil society groups say this is a false comparison, as lobbyists have comparatively more power at the talks. Ciel’s analysis shows several lobbyists appear on government delegations from where they can actively sculpt the treaty text. Their impact is also felt on the outside, as even the lobbyists who attend only as negotiation observers – a group that includes industry representatives, civil society organisations and scientists – have “privileged access” to delegates, for example, through industry-sponsored unofficial side events that are common in the margins of the talks.\nJo Banner, who is part of the US civil society environmental justice delegation, and lives in Louisiana’s petrochemical industry hub known as “Cancer Alley”, highlights the disconnect between the lobbying work that industry representatives will do in Geneva and the harms that this ultimately leads to on the ground.\n“This is just a job for them. This is about their 401(k)s and their retirement plans. It’s life or death for us and I don’t want my obituary to be part of their resumé. We’re here fighting to protect our communities. It’s beyond being a job for us.”\nLast week, Greenpeace released a report showing that seven petrochemical majors – including Dow, ExxonMobil and Shell – have collectively increased their plastic production capacity by 1.4m tonnes since the start of the treaty-making process and have sent a combined total of 70 representatives to the talks.\nAnother factor that may have an effect on the ongoing negotiations is the death in a helicopter accident of the Ghanaian environment minister, Dr Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed, who was due at the meeting alongside more than 70 government ministers next week. Ghana is the chair of the African Group, a 52-nation bloc that has favoured an ambitious treaty from the beginning.\nIf the talks go according to schedule, an agreement should be reached by 14 August."

    "raw_text": "Particles from vehicle tyre wear are the biggest source of nanoplastic pollution in the high Alps, a pioneering project has revealed.\nExpert mountaineers teamed up with scientists to collect contamination-free samples and are now scaling peaks to produce the first global assessment of nanoplastics, which are easily carried around the world by winds.\nMillions of tonnes of plastic waste are dumped in the environment and much is broken down into small fragments. Microplastics were already known to have polluted the entire planet, from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans.\nHowever, nanoplastics are even tinier and have been difficult to collect and analyse. Researchers are concerned about the health impact of ubiquitous plastic pollution, and nanoplastics may be even more dangerous than microplastics as they are small enough to penetrate cell membranes and remain lodged in the body.\n“We were really glad that these initial results [from the Alps] were good,” said Dr Dušan Materić, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. “Then we thought about what to do next, and said: ‘Let’s go crazy, let’s do it globally.’”\n“It will be the first study of global background nanoplastic pollution,” he said. “We need to establish that baseline so we can come back in future decades and see if things have got better or worse. It is a pioneering study, putting this issue on the map.” The mapping will also help identify the sources of the nanoplastics and guide efforts to reduce the pollution.\nSince the Alpine expeditions, mountaineers have obtained high-altitude samples of glacier snow from the Mountains of the Moon on the Uganda-Congo border, as well as from Bolivia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, New Zealand and the south pole and Ellsworth Mountains in Antarctica.\nIn 2025, the Global Atmospheric Plastics Survey plans to get further samples from Svalbard and Iceland in the Arctic, as well as Mount Everest, India, Wyoming and Alaska in the US, and northern Canada, plus further European samples from the Spanish Pyrenees, Poland and Norway.\n“These remote places are very important to be analysed because you want to cover as much of the world as possible,” said Materić. “But it would be impossible without the mountaineers.”\nTaking samples from very isolated places avoids local sources of nanoplastics dominating the readings, and using glacier snow means only particles falling from the sky are collected.\nThe Alpine survey, published in the journal Scientific Reports, found nanoplastics in five of the 14 sites sampled in the French, Swiss and Italian Alps. The most abundant nanoplastic was tyre particles (41%), then polystyrene (28%) and polyethylene (12%). Each tyre on the world’s 1.6bn vehicles can lose 4kg during its lifetimes and may be the largest source of tiny plastic pollution.\nGiven the pervasive pollution of the planet with plastic, it was crucial to avoid contamination. The team developed a collection method that avoided contamination from the gear and clothing of the mountaineers, much of which is made from plastic. A further complication was that the collection kit had to be light. “These are a pretty hardcore expeditions – if you give the mountaineers too much weight, they will struggle,” said Dr Al Gill, who led the Alpine expedition.\nThe results showed that collecting triplicate samples of snow in small glass vials, plus a blank sample as a control, delivered uncontaminated readings.\nProf Andreas Stohl, at the University of Vienna, who was not part of the study team, said a global map of nanoplastics would break important new ground. He said nanoplastics were of particular concern for health as, unlike most microplastics, they could penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream.\nThe Alpine samples were collected in summer, and Stohl said that could complicate the interpretation of the results. Summer melting could concentrate the nanoplastics or in other circumstances flush them away, he said, and snow that had lain for months could collect nanoplastics from different source regions as the winds changed.\nAnother group of explorers are also taking micro- and nanoplastic samples in remote places. Mission Spiritus has just completed a 1,000km traverse of Oman’s vast desert landscape. The team endured sandstorms and blistering temperatures and traversed some of the highest sand dunes in the world to collect 52 sand samples for analysis at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.\nPeople are already known to consume tiny plastic particles via food and water, as well as breathing them in. Microplastics have been discovered in human blood, semen and breast milk and in brains, livers and bone marrow, indicating profuse contamination of people’s bodies. The impact on health is as yet unknown but microplastics have been shown to cause damage to human cells in the laboratory and have been linked to strokes and heart attacks."

    "raw_text": "A study has found microplastic and nanoplastic pollution to be significantly higher in placentas from premature births than in those from full-term births.\nThe levels were much higher than previously detected in blood, suggesting the tiny plastic particles were accumulating in the placenta. But the higher average levels found in the shorter pregnancies were a “big surprise” for the researchers, as longer terms could be expected to lead to more accumulation.\nPreterm birth is the leading cause of infant death worldwide, and the reasons for about two-thirds of all preterm births were unknown, said Dr Enrico Barrozo, of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, US. The established link between air pollution and millions of premature births had spurred the research team to investigate plastic pollution.\nThe new study only demonstrates an association between microplastics and premature births. Further research is needed in cell cultures and animal models to determine if the link is causal. Microplastics are known to cause inflammation in human cells, and inflammation is one of the factors that prompts the start of labour.\nMicroplastics, broken down from plastic waste, have polluted the entire planet from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. People are already known to consume the tiny particles via food, water and by breathing them in.\nMicroplastics were first detected in placentas in 2020 and have also been found in semen, breast milk, brains, livers and bone marrow, indicating profuse contamination of people’s bodies. The impact on human health is little known, but microplastics have been linked to strokes and heart attacks.\n“Our study hints at the possibility that the accumulation of plastics could be contributing to the occurrence of preterm birth,” said Prof Kjersti Aagaard, at Boston children’s hospital in the US. “Combined with other recent research, this study adds to the growing body of evidence that demonstrates a real risk from exposure to plastics on human health and disease.”\nThe research was presented on Thursday at the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s annual meeting in Denver, and has been submitted to an academic journal. The researchers analysed 100 placentas from full-term births (37.2 weeks, on average) and 75 from preterm births (34 weeks), all from the Houston area.\nAnalysis with highly sensitive mass spectrometry found 203 micrograms of plastic per gram of tissue (µg/g) in the premature placentas – more than 50% higher than the 130µg/g in the full-term placentas.\nTwelve types of plastic were detected, with the most significant differences between the full and preterm birth placentas being for PET, as used in plastic bottles, PVC, polyurethane and polycarbonate.\nSome mothers are at higher risk of preterm births, due to their age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. But a strong link between the plastic particles and premature birth remained even when these factors were taken into account.\n“This study showed an association and not causation,” said Barrozo. “But I think it is important to increase people’s awareness of microplastics and their associations with potential human health effects.”\nThe effectiveness of actions to cut people’s exposure to microplastics also needed urgent study, he said. “Those interventions need to be studied in order to show that there’s a benefit to avoiding these plastics.”"

    "raw_text": "Thailand has banned plastic waste imports over concerns about toxic pollution, as experts warn that failure to agree a global treaty to cut plastic waste will harm human health.\nA law banning imports of plastic waste came into force this month in Thailand, after years of campaigning by activists. Thailand is one of several south-east Asian countries that has historically been paid to receive plastic waste from developed nations. The country became a leading destination for exports of plastic waste from Europe, the US, the UK and Japan in 2018 after China, the world’s biggest market for household waste, imposed a ban.\nJapan is one of the biggest exporters of waste plastic to Thailand, with about 50m kg exported in 2023.\nThai customs officials said more than 1.1m tonnes of plastic scraps were imported between 2018 and 2021.\nPenchom Sae-Tang, the director of the NGO Ecological Alert and Recovery, said: “The ban on all plastic scrap imports should be seen as a triumph for civil society in preventing hazardous waste entering Thailand.” But she warned vigilant monitoring and robust cooperation with authorities would be vital to make sure the ban was enforced.\nImports of plastic were often mismanaged in Thailand, with many factories burning the waste rather than recycling it, leading to damage to human health and the environment.\nPunyathorn Jeungsmarn, a plastics campaign researcher at the Environmental Justice Foundation, said: “While this is a great step forward for Thailand, there is more work to be done. After the law comes into effect, the Thai government must work to ensure its enforcement and implementation. This means industrial, environmental and customs agencies must cooperate to prevent any illicit imports of plastic waste … the current law does not address the transit of plastic waste, meaning Thailand could be used as a transit state to send waste to our … neighbours. The Thai government must guard against this.”\nThe ban comes into force as discussions continue in an attempt to rescue the global plastic waste treaty. Last year nations failed to agree the final wording of the treaty after talks in Busan. More than 100 countries supported a draft text that included legally binding global reductions in plastic production, which stands at more than 400m tonnes annually, and phasing out certain chemicals and single-use plastic products.\nBut the resistance of oil-producing countries including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia to cuts in production led negotiators to concede defeat.\nProf Steve Fletcher, the director of the Revolution Plastics Institute at the University of Portsmouth, said a failure to agree a treaty to end plastic pollution was a threat to human health.\n“Plastic pollution is now recognised as not only an environmental crisis but also a critical human health crisis. The need for decisive international action to tackle plastic pollution has never been more urgent,” he said.\nIn an article in the British Medical Journal, Fletcher said the unresolved disagreements at the treaty talks over cuts to production hindered progress towards a global agreement to protect human and environmental health.\nEmerging research shows that there are substantial health risks from microplastic exposure, including increased risk of stroke, hearth attack and death. Some studies suggest microplastics play a role in dementia, the article said.\nBurning plastic as a method of waste management posed severe health risks, which was compounded by the trade in plastic waste, he said.\nDr Cressida Bowyer, the deputy director of the Revolution Plastics Institute, which has carried out research into the dangers of open burning of plastic waste, said: “With 16% of global municipal waste burned openly, rising to 40-65% in low-and middle-income countries, vulnerable populations bear the brunt of this crisis. The toxic fumes from burning plastic are a silent but deadly contributor to global health burdens. Urgent action is needed.”\nNo date has yet been agreed for further discussions on the global treaty to end plastic waste."

    "raw_text": "The Environmental Protection Agency is launching a formal review of five highly toxic plastic chemicals, including vinyl chloride, the notorious compound at the center of the East Palestine, Ohio, train wreck fire.\nThe move could lead to strong limits or bans on the substances.\nVinyl chloride is most commonly used in PVC pipe and packaging production, but is also cancerous and highly flammable. For about 50 years, the federal government has considered limits on the substance, but industry has thwarted most regulatory efforts, hid the substances’ risks and is already mobilizing against the new review.\nThe step is “one of the most important chemical review processes ever undertaken” by the agency, said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics and a former EPA administrator.\n“I applaud the EPA,” she added.\nThe federal government designates vinyl chloride as a known carcinogen, and the substance is also a neurotoxicant linked to liver damage, permanent changes to bones, and other serious health issues. The EPA is also reviewing acetaldehyde, benzenamine, acrylonitrile and MBOCA, each used in the production of plastic and rubber. All the chemicals are considered to be or are probable carcinogens and linked to other health problems, like anemia, kidney damage and neurotoxicity.\nThe nation’s use of vinyl chloride drew intense scrutiny after dozens of cars on a Norfolk Southern train derailed and burned in February 2023 in East Palestine. The fire burned near tankers carrying vinyl chloride, and, two days later, fearing a “major explosion”, officials conducted a controlled burn of the chemical as a preventive measure.\nWhen vinyl chloride burns, it creates dioxins, a highly toxic and carcinogenic chemical class that can stay in the environment for generations. The levels of dioxin found in East Palestine in the days after the wreck were hundreds of times greater than the exposure threshold above which the EPA in 2010 found poses cancer risks. Soil and food contamination are considered to be among the most common exposure routes, and the controlled burn’s towering plume also sent dioxins across 16 states.\nVinyl chloride is transported in freight trains that are prone to accidents, and East Palestine was only one in a series of vinyl chloride incidents – experts expect a similar accident. A recent report found more than 3 million Americans live within one mile of railroad tracks on which vinyl chloride is transported.\nThe Vinyl Institute, which represents vinyl chloride and PVC producers, has downplayed the risk, and labeled the reports “publicity stunts”.\nThe EPA’s announcement concludes a year-long period in which it gathered comments from industry, public health advocates, labor and others involved in the substances’ use, as is required under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which covers the nation’s use of toxic chemicals.\nIt will spend the next three months gathering more information, and, following that, determine whether to classify the chemicals as high-priority substances under TSCA. That would trigger a formal study to determine if vinyl chloride presents an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment.\nThat assessment could take three years, and, following that, the EPA would establish new rules. But the action faces an uncertain future – incoming Trump allies have already signaled that they will kill any proposed regulations that have not been finalized.\nOpposition from industry against PVC limits is expected to be stiff in part because the substance is used in medical devices, vinyl siding for buildings, drinking water pipes, electrical wiring, household goods like shower curtains and raincoats. Industry groups have already touted the substance’s ubiquity in a statement on the EPA’s announcement.\n“[It] presents a welcome opportunity to share our expertise on the many indispensable uses of this highly regulated material,” the Vinyl Institute wrote."

    "raw_text": "Labake Ajiboye-Richard, the founder of a Lagos-based sustainability consultancy, was driving in Nigeria’s most populous city earlier this month when she saw someone throwing rubbish out of their car window.\n“I was so shocked to see that in 2024,” she said. “If you’re throwing something on the road, what are you doing in your home? What are you doing in your community?”\nLagos – like the rest of Nigeria – has a rubbish problem, particularly when it comes to plastic. Figures from the World Bank show the country generates 27.6m kilotonnes of municipal solid waste annually – one of the highest volumes globally – of which 13% is plastic. Only about a tenth of that plastic waste is recycled.\nResearch this year by the UN environment programme found an estimated 50-60m used water sachets are thrown on to the streets every day in Lagos alone.\nIn January, Nigerian authorities announced a ban on single-use plastics, effective from next month, but there is little evidence the country is ready for implementation.\nFood vendors from Abeokuta to Calabar and Kaduna to Onitsha are still using Styrofoams and other disposable single-use plastics daily. And at the Oniru and Tejuosho markets in Lagos, some traders said they had not even heard of the ban. Their preoccupation was the cost of living crisis.\nSince taking office in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu and the central bank governor, Yemi Cardoso, have embarked on a series of controversial economic changes that external actors such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have commended. However, many regular citizens say any intended impact of the overhauls are yet to trickle down. Moreover, they are choosing to focus on making ends meet, rather than on the single-use plastics deadline.\n“T-Pain and Cardi B want to kill us before our time,” said Amos Adeyanju, a 28-year-old taxi driver, referencing the popular nicknames of the president and bank chief. “I spend almost half my daily earnings on buying fuel and buying food, why should I also spend on expensive alternatives when plastic is cheaper and easier to get?”\nIn August, federal authorities discontinued single-use plastic in government offices, and the environment ministry said it was establishing “a comprehensive framework to support effective sensitisation, implementation and enforcement of the ban across the country”.\nBut observers are sceptical.\nAdewunmi Emoruwa, the lead policy strategist at the Abuja-based public strategy and media group Gatefield, described the implementation of the anti-plastic policy as “lacklustre”.\n“The industry has had decades to either pay up or clean up its act, yet it continues to unduly influence regulators with the same stale talking points,” he said. “When fiscal strategies fail to align with policy rhetoric, what should be enforceable rules devolve into mere suggestions.”\nExperts say a lot of unsustainable practices that involve the use of plastic are relatively new in African culture. Food for instance used to be wrapped in banana leaves and fermentation processes were common, to extend the life cycle of edible items.\nSome are advocating an integration of some of those old concepts as well as the introduction of incentives to change attitudes.\n“I think there’s a crucial missing step, which is addressing behaviours, [explaining] why single-use plastic is bad for the environment,” said Ajiboye-Richard. “Money is always an incentive to everybody … and a high factor in decision-making.”\nUntil then, progress is unlikely, she added. “If I start seeing some of these strategies in place, I feel like we can get single-use plastic from the shelves by 2030.”"

    "raw_text": "Nadine Luci lives on a breezy hill south-western Pennsylvania, but hardly ever opens her windows for fear the air outside is harming her.\n“I have to live in a cocoon year-round,” she said.\nLuci, 60, lives just two miles from the Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, a huge plant that “cracks” ethane, a byproduct of fracked gas, to make millions of tons of plastic each year. The plant, which became operational in 2022, sits on 386 acres along the Ohio River in Monaca, Pennsylvania.\nInitially, Luci was concerned about the project’s pollution in an area long plagued by emissions-heavy industry. But she looked forward to the needed jobs the plant would bring to a region that has seen many factories and mills shutter.\nIn the following years, Luci’s optimism faded. Some days, she noticed dark plumes billowing from the cracker’s stacks. Other nights, the project would shoot flames or dye the sky orange. And every couple of months, a nauseating sweet odor wafted from the plant, like a syrup you would never want to eat.\nOne morning this past summer, Luci and her neighbor were having a coffee outside when they were hit with “a huge and rancid chlorine smell” that burned her eyes and nose.\nLuci, who grew up in nearby Beaver, has suffered from respiratory illness since childhood and she fears pollution from the plant is exacerbating her symptoms. Since its construction began in 2017, the plant has received 33 violations for illegal levels of air and water pollution.\n“I don’t even want to drink my tap water,” said Luci, who fished in the Ohio River’s tributaries as a youth.\nThe Ohio River supplies drinking water to more than 5 million people, including Luci’s town of Rochester. It is one of the most contaminated watersheds in the country. John Stolz, a microbiologist at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, said it was “definitely possible” that the Shell project had added to that contamination.\nNatalie Gunnell, spokesperson for the Shell plastic plant, said “the local water suppliers treat and monitor the drinking water.”\nHeather Hulton VanTassel, who directs the Three Rivers Waterkeeper organization in Pennsylvania, said Luci’s water should be cleaned by authorities, though bills may increase if they have to increase “pollutant removal”.\nFor her part, Luci said she had noticed a “dead fish” smell occasionally coming from her tap water. Like many of her neighbors, she buys plastic water bottles in bulk. “We bitch about it, but we buy it, plastic, constantly,” she said from her kitchen.\nCritics say support for the plant was built on the company’s use of manipulative public relations tactics, and on reports that overstated the plant’s expected economic benefits while downplaying its potential environmental harms.\n“I think some of us went pretty quickly from hearing it’s going to increase jobs and home values and fix the economy … to learning it was going to be an environmental disaster,” said Rachel Meyer, a coordinator for the environmental group Moms Clean Air Force, from her dining room.\nShell’s local influence campaign, critics say, came amid a broader, decades-long effort by fossil fuel companies to downplay the dangers of fossil fuels.\nGunnell said that Shell had “made it a priority to work closely with communities near our operations to manage the social impacts of our activities and enhance the benefits we are able to bring”.\nPlastics boom for whom?\nIn 2008, Pennsylvania began to experience a surge in fracking, giving fossil fuel producers access to once inaccessible gas. The boom left the area awash in petrochemicals including ethane, a common raw ingredient in plastics.\nFour years later, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers, looking to capitalize on this abundance, proposed offering Shell $1.6bn in tax incentives to build a new plastics plant – the largest subsidy package in Pennsylvania history. Citing Shell’s promise to create up to 20,000 jobs, they said the project would revitalize local economies.\nTwo Shell-funded studies would later back up that claim: a 2014 report estimated the plant would contribute up to $4.4bn to the local economy over its 40-year operating lifespan, and a 2021 follow-up report placed that estimate at up to $17bn.\nBut in January, independent analysts with the Ohio River Valley Institute found that the studies were too rosy, due to their failure to consider costs to the public or shifts in the market and regulatory environment.\nThough nearly 8,600 workers did provide a surge of economic activity to Beaver county during the plant’s construction, many hailed from out of state. Today, the cracker plant only employs about 500 full-time workers, according to Shell.\n“They say they’re creating hundreds of jobs, but that’s a drop in the damn bucket,” said Luci.\nOfficials said the plant would anchor a vast petrochemical hub, employing tens of thousands, but that hub never materialized.\nGunnell said: “We are proud of the jobs, economic benefits and social investment dollars and projects we have brought to the region and will continue to bring to the regional economy for decades to come.”\nPollution\nWhen the new plant began operations in November 2022, Shell touted a “strong and innovative safety focus”. But the Shell plant emits a wide range of pollutants, including volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and other toxins that have been linked to illnesses ranging from respiratory disease to cancer.\nThe project has received two dozen violations for air pollution and eight for water contamination, with the first issued just months after construction began in 2017, and the most recent issued in September.\n“Meeting or exceeding regulatory requirements is part of our operating framework,” Gunnell said. “If we fall short, we aim to understand why and implement new ways of working that are clear and actionable.”\nShell reports emissions to regulators and publishes “fenceline monitoring results” from the facility’s property line, Gunnell noted. Advocates say the latter came only after years of pressure.\nResidents have also accused officials of failing to address locals’ concerns. In April 2023, as neighbors said that the air smelled like kerosene, monitors placed by a local grassroots organization detected levels of benzene that exceeded federal standards. But when the Pennsylvania environment department came out to investigate, they relied only on a human “sniff test” and downplayed concerns, advocates said.\n“Visiting the Shell plant and merely smelling the air is inadequate to assess whether there are any air permit violations or malfunctions, let alone whether it’s safe to breathe the air,” said Alex Bomstein, executive director of the environmental non-profit the Clean Air Council.\nBenzene, the main pollutant of concern during the incident, can be smelled in concentrations of 12 parts per million, but federal officials say exposure to concentrations of just 0.01 parts per million require workers to wear protective equipment, he noted.\nLauren Camarda, the Pennsylvania environment department spokesperson, said the agency was “committed to ensuring that the Shell facility is operating in accordance with Pennsylvania’s laws and regulations and has held them accountable for violations”, Since fall 2023, the Shell plant’s emissions have been on a “constant downward trend”, she said.\nThe Clean Air Council and other green groups have taken legal action against Shell over this incident and others. Those organizations are also pressuring the state to tighten the plant’s water pollution limits.\nIn May 2023, the company agreed to a $10m settlement with the state for air pollution violations. The plant had then only been operational for about six months, but had already surpassed its 12-month emissions limits on volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and other pollutants. This agreement addressed “previous emissions exceedances”, Gunnell said.\nShell was required to report the facility’s emissions to authorities monthly as part of the settlement, Camarda said.\nA local resident this February also launched litigation claiming the plant is both a private and public nuisance and seeking class-action status. And in a Washington county courthouse in early December, Shell was convicted of criminal charges after pleading no contest to three misdemeanor counts brought by the Pennsylvania attorney general, for violating the state’s clean streams law during the construction of the Falcon pipeline, which feeds gas to the cracker plant.\n“Shell is aware of two lawsuits pending in the western district of Pennsylvania relating to Shell Polymers Monaca, which remain in active litigation,” Gunnell said, adding that Shell’s positions on and responses to the allegations were public record.\nAt peak capacity, the project will require ethane to be extracted from 1,000 new gas wells every five to 10 years, experts say, creating additional pollution.\n‘You can’t avoid influence’\nBefore construction on the plant began, Shell’s plastics division began providing equipment to local schools and sponsoring scholarships – public relations tactics that have recently come under increasing scrutiny. It even spent $1m to create a new technology program – which sports the Shell name – at one community college.\nThe company has also donated handsomely to the local Salvation Army, the YMCA, and other non-profits, and has paid for local park benches and a new basketball court at one elementary school.\nGunnell, the Shell spokesperson, said: “We have enjoyed the support of the local community and are committed to being a good neighbor.\n“The bulk of our Shell Polymers employees live, work and play here, so we want to help make our community better whenever we can,” she added.\nBut Vanessa Lynch, a local organizer with Moms Clean Air Force, said many residents find their community contributions confusing.\n“You have a company that is a huge corporation, and they’re telling you: we want to help the community,” she said. “But then, as a community member, you’re watching the increase in fracking. You’re watching a red sky at night. You’re smelling smells …It’s hard to have those two things in your head at the same time.”\nLocal activists say even the payout from the 2023 lawsuit – half of which has been allocated for air monitoring, environmental projects and other initiatives – has been confused for altruism.\n“I’ve heard residents and even county employees mention it like it’s a charity,” said Andie Grey, an activist who lives three miles from the plant.\nShell’s donations may serve to damp down criticism and influence public opinion, said Terrie Baumgardner, a board member of the Beaver County Marcellus Awareness Community. “It seems to me that you can’t avoid influence when money comes into play,” she said.\nYears before the plant started operating, Baumgardner said she asked an assistant at a local university, where she had worked for 26 years, to use a room for a local environmental group to hold a public meeting.\n“Well, you know, Terrie, we have partnerships with Shell,” she remembers being told. Her request was rejected.\nTimmons Roberts, professor of environment and sociology at Brown University, who studies fossil fuel companies’ public relations campaigns, said it was common for polluting sectors to partner with community groups to boost their image.\n“That’s true on the smaller scale when local people are worried about new industries, and it’s true on the big scale to soothe concerns about climate,” he said. “It seems like a favor … but I think mostly it’s meant to shut people up.”\nImpacts beyond Pennsylvania\nThe Shell plant is expected to reach its full production capacity in 2025 or 2026, when the company says it will produce up to 3.5bn tons of plastic pellets a year. Permits allow the plant to spew out 2.25m tons of planet-heating carbon dioxide annually – the equivalent of putting 523,604 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles on the road.\nPlastic creation accounts for 5% of all global carbon emissions, and absent decisive policy changes, that figure is expected to rise. In early December, the latest round of negotiations to reach a global treaty on plastic pollution collapsed amid accusations that industry involvement hampered the negotiations.\nReports indicate that Shell has been aware since the 1970s of the planet-warming impacts of fossil fuels like the ones used to produce plastic. It has set targets to ramp down its carbon emissions but this year watered them down.\nAsked for comment, Gunnell said: “The Shell Group did not have unique knowledge about climate change.\n“The issue of climate change and how to tackle it has long been part of public discussion and ongoing scientific research for many decades,” she said.\nAsked about the planet-heating impacts of using fossil fuels to make plastics, Gunnell said that Shell “supports the need for improved circularity in the global plastics markets, encouraging the reduction, reuse, and recycling of plastics”.\nShe added that Shell was supporting local recycling efforts, including in Beaver county. But globally less than 10% of plastics are ever recycled.\nPlastic producers – including Shell – were warned decades ago that recycling is not an economically or technically feasible plastic waste management solution, a February report revealed. In July, Shell also quietly backed away from a pledge to rapidly increase its use of “advanced recycling” – a polluting practice oil and petrochemical producers have promoted as a solution to the plastics pollution crisis, the Guardian reported. Gunnell did not comment on either finding.\nMeyer, of Moms Clean Air Force, feels that her region was “sacrificed” for the sake of profits.\n“I don’t like to think of myself as just as expendable [as a] plastic bag,” she said.\nBut it now seems that even Shell’s profit targets are not panning out. The company has already acknowledged that it won’t meet its initial target – making $1bn to $1.5bn in earnings from the plant – until 2025 at the earliest. And in October, the thinktank the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis found that it may not even reach that goal by the end of 2026, thanks to expected increases in the cost of gas and shifting market dynamics.\n“All this sacrifice has been pretty much for nothing,” said Abhishek Sinha, who led the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis research.\nAs she has continued to see the Shell plastic plant spew pollution into her community, Nadine Luci has thought about moving away. It’s painful to think of leaving her local family members and her childhood memories, but she’s afraid her body can’t handle the pollution.\n“It feels wrong because all my roots are here,” she said. “I’ve been here all this time, and now I have to be the one to figure out how to escape.”\nReporting for this story was made possible through a Climate Disinformation Fellowship from the Heinrich Boell Foundation, Washington"

    "raw_text": "EU member states are still wrangling over crucial commitments on the climate crisis with no sign of agreement, according to a leaked draft text seen by the Guardian.\nWith just weeks to go before a UN-set deadline, the European Commission and key member states remain at loggerheads over targets on greenhouse gas emissions, with the prospect of a strong outcome looking increasingly imperilled.\nThe negotiating document seen by the Guardian leaves blanks marked with square brackets, and placeholder text where the key numbers laying out new targets should be. Experts said the lack of any numbers, even of a provisional nature, or a range, was a poor sign at such a late stage of the process.\nNiklas Höhne, a co-founder of the research organisation New Climate Institute, said: “It is disappointing to see that the internal discussions on the EU’s new climate target do not yet include target values. It is getting very late. It is now extremely urgent that the EU presents a new climate target to the international negotiations. So far, only 28 out of 196 countries have submitted a new target. Only the EU’s submission could unleash momentum and move other countries to follow suit.”\nMember states and the commission have been working on an agreement for months to fulfil the bloc’s obligations under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to come up with commitments on carbon reductions for the next decade.\nAll countries must produce national plans on emissions, called nationally determined contributions (NDCs), under the Paris agreement, but so far only about 30 have done so. The UN has called on all countries to submit their NDCs before a key meeting on the sidelines of the UN general assembly on 24 September, to give time for them to be assessed before the Cop30 climate summit in Brazil this November.\nThe EU’s current target is for reductions of 55% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, which the bloc should be able to meet if policies are strengthened.\nThe next NDC, for 2035, should set the EU on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, which would imply a reduction of 90% to 95% in emissions by 2040, and therefore a reduction of about 74% to 78% in emissions by 2035, depending on how it is calculated.\nMichael Petroni, a climate policy analyst for Climate Analytics, said that to reach net zero emissions, more action was needed in the shorter term, rather than delaying action until closer to mid-century. He said: “The leaked document fails to state a 2035 target, but a graph implies a simple linear path from 2030 to 2040. Our analysis clearly shows that none of the resulting 2035 levels would be aligned with 1.5C. A straight-line approach delays critical near-term action, at a time when global leadership is most needed.”\nThe EU’s discussions are made more complicated by timelines. The EU’s internal plans call for a 2040 target, which was supposed to be set first, so that an NDC with a 2035 goal could be extrapolated from that. But some member states have raised the prospect of separating the discussions, so that an NDC could be set first and a 2040 target later.\nAny separation would almost certainly imply a weaker NDC and 2040 target than experts are calling for, however, and any delay to the NDC would be seized on by those who wish Cop30 to fail.\nEmmanuel Macron, the president of France, has raised the prospect of a delay or dilution of the bloc’s commitments. Campaigners fear Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may weaken despite his need for backing from the Greens, and Giorgia Meloni, the prime minister of Italy, has railed against EU green policies in the past. Viktor Orbán, the hard-right leader of Hungary, is also expected to push to weaken the target.\nAndreas Sieber, the associate director of global policy and campaigns at the civil society group 350.org, said: “Macron and rightwing anti-Europeans like Orbán and Meloni are playing a reckless political game with the EU climate target. The delays contradict the urgency of climate action and the pursuit of security and prosperity – clean energy delivered nearly a third of Europe’s economic growth last year, and an ambitious target promises more jobs, energy security, more investment, and higher competitiveness on the global stage.”\nAny perception of a lack of commitment from the EU would cause problems at Cop30, a summit already troubled by US hostility and geopolitical headwinds. Donald Trump has, for a second time, announced the withdrawal of the US from the Paris agreement, and is dismantling climate policies and environmental institutions in the US.\nAlthough no other countries have yet followed him out of the Paris agreement, countries that want to slow or obstruct progress at Cop30 – including petrostates such as Russia and Saudi Arabia – have been heartened by Trump’s stance. Other countries may see Cop30 and climate targets as less of a diplomatic priority amid geopolitical turmoil – China and India, which have yet to produce their NDCs, have formed warmer relationships with Russia.\nSieber warned that the EU must play a stronger role: “At a time when we should be collectively stewarding the Paris agreement, it is a bitter and dangerous irony that French president Macron is attempting to water down ambition. These games undermine Europe’s credibility at Cop30, stain the legacy of the Paris agreement, and shamefully betray the climate commitments the world is counting on.”\nThe European Commission declined to comment on the leaked document."

    "raw_text": "Brazil has issued an urgent call for all countries to come forward with strengthened national plans on the climate, in a last-ditch attempt to meet a key September deadline.\nOnly 28 countries have so far submitted carbon-cutting proposals to the UN, with some of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases – including China and the EU – still to produce their plans.\nOn Tuesday Brazil, which will host the crunch Cop30 UN climate summit this November, issued a summons to all governments to a key meeting on 25 September, on the sidelines of the UN annual general assembly in New York. The UN needs all national plans – known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – by that date to compile a “synthesis report”, which will show how far off track the world is on the crucial goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels.\nAndré Corrêa do Lago, the veteran Brazilian diplomat who will preside over Cop30, wrote to governments on Tuesday to urge them to submit ambitious NDCs, and warned that if they were not strong enough then further action would be needed at Cop30.\nHe wrote: “Far from representing mere climate targets for 2035, our NDCs represent the vision of our shared future. They are vehicles of cooperation, enabling us to realise this vision together. If the image shown by NDCs turns out disappointing, it is our collective responsibility to convert it into a picture that will ensure a livable planet, protect all economies, and improve living standards and life opportunities for all peoples, for all generations.”\nBrazil has markedly stepped up its diplomatic efforts in the past week, as the prospects for Cop30 look increasingly difficult. Brazil’s president, Lula da Silva, held a one hour call with China’s Xi Jinping last week in which the climate was a key priority.\nDo Lago said: “We are quite convinced that China will publish an ambitious NDC in time for the synthesis report. We are very confident that China is taking this exercise very seriously.”\nThe “presidency consultation” meeting called for 25 September is a new departure, as such meetings normally only take place during the final stages of Cops. It will be followed by another on 15 October, both aimed at preventing the gridlock that has afflicted recent UN climate meetings, at which negotiations have been unable to start on time because of disagreements over what should be on the agenda.\nBut the Cop30 presidency has been beset by problems amid a worsening geopolitical situation, reinforced by Donald Trump’s red-carpet treatment of Vladimir Putin last week in Alaska. Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris climate agreement, and Putin’s war in Ukraine has proved a bonanza for fossil fuel interests.\nBrazil has also suffered obstacles of its own making, including the siting of the summit in Belém, a small city at the mouth of the Amazon River. Developing countries and civil society groups have grown increasingly anxious at the lack of hotels and other accommodation, and the high prices charged, and there are questions over whether Belém’s airport has the capacity and security needed for the scores of world leaders who have been invited.\nBelém only has about 18,000 hotel rooms in normal times, while about 50,000 people are expected to attend Cop30. While Brazil’s government has commissioned two large cruise ships to moor at Belém for about 6,000 attenders, and set up a platform for Belém residents to rent out rooms and apartments, the cheapest rooms are about $400 a night for the fortnight of talks, with many hotel rooms priced at well over $1,000 a night. These are daunting sums for many of the most vulnerable countries, who can only afford to send a handful of delegates in contrast to the scores of officials sent by some of the biggest emitters. Civil society groups and media organisations have also warned they are being shut out of the event.\nAna Toni, chief executive of Cop30, said: “Prices have started to come down and we expect that to continue.”\nBrazil has also made key concessions to other countries over what will be on the agenda for Cop30. While NDCs are crucial to global climate action, they were not originally set to be the focus of the Cop30 agenda, as Brazil maintained they would be settled before the summit and therefore not subject to negotiation.\nHowever, many countries made it clear that discussing the NDCs and their impacts would be central to fulfilling the Paris agreement. Do Lago said there would be opportunities for parties to discuss all key issues: “Some of the issues that the public in general expect more discussion on at Cop were not included in the agenda. So what we want to do is make sure we are dealing with these issues, that are considered important by stakeholders. There is a huge debate about trust in these negotiations, and I firmly believe that transparency is essential.”"

    "raw_text": "No one who was in the hall that winter evening in a gloomy conference centre on the outskirts of the French capital will ever forget it. Tension had been building throughout the afternoon, as after two weeks of fraught talks the expected resolution was delayed and then delayed yet again. Rumours swirled – had the French got it wrong? Was another climate failure approaching, the latest botched attempt at solving the world’s global heating crisis?\nFinally, as the mood in the hall was growing twitchy, the UN security guards cleared the platform and the top officials of the landmark Paris climate talks took to the podium. For two weeks, 196 countries had huddled in countless meetings, wrangling over dense pages of text, scrutinising every semicolon. And they had finally reached agreement. Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister in charge of the gruelling talks, looking exhausted but delighted, reached for his gavel and brought it down with a resounding crack. The Paris agreement was approved at last.\nNicholas Stern, the climate economist, found himself hugging Xia Zhenhua, the normally reserved Chinese minister, while whoops and shouts echoed round the hall. “I felt that the Paris agreement was the moment when the world decided it really had to manage climate change in a serious way,” he said. “We were all in it together, that’s what people realised.”\nAt Paris, for the first time rich and poor countries joined together in a legally binding treaty pledging to hold global heating to heating well below 2C, the scientifically-advised limit of safety, with an aspiration not to breach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Those two weeks of tense talks in the French capital were the climax of 25 years of tortuous negotiations on the climate, since governments were warned of the dangers of climate chaos in 1990. The failure, discord and recriminations of those decades were left behind as delegates from 196 countries hugged, wept and cheered in Paris.\nTodd Stern, climate envoy to President Barack Obama, recalls: “My team and I had been working toward this for seven years … and the story of climate negotiations had so often been one of disappointment. And yet here we were and we knew that we had – all together – done a really big thing. A very special moment. An unforgettable one.”\nThe accord itself has proved remarkably resilient. Bringing together 196 nations in 2015 was not easy – even as Fabius brought down the gavel on the agreement, there was a little chicanery as Nicaragua had planned to object to the required consensus, but was ignored. Yet that consensus has remained robust. When the US – the world’s biggest economy and second biggest emitter – began the process of withdrawal from Paris, under President Donald Trump in 2017, a disaster might have been expected. The Kyoto 1997 protocol fell apart after the US signed but failed to ratify the agreement, leaving climate negotiations in limbo for a decade.\nIf Trump was hoping to wreck Paris, he was disappointed: the rest of the world shrugged and carried on. There was no exodus of other countries, although some did pursue more aggressive tactics at the annual UN talks. The key axis of China and the EU remained intact, deliberately underlined by China’s President Xi Jinping when he chose to surprise the world with a net zero emissions target at the UN general assembly in September, just as the UN election race was hotting up.\nRemy Rioux, one of the French government team who led the talks, now chief executive of the French Development Agency, said: “The Paris agreement has proven to be inclusive and at scale, with the participation of countries representing 97% of global emissions, as well as that of non-state actors such as businesses, local government and financial institutions – and very resilient, precisely because it is inclusive. The Paris agreement is a powerful signal of hope in the face of the climate emergency.”\nOn some measures, Paris could be judged a failure. Emissions in 2015 were about 50 bn tonnes. By 2019, they had risen to about 55bn tonnes, according to the UN Environment Programme (Unep). Carbon output fell dramatically, by about 17% overall and far more in some regions, in this spring’s coronavirus lockdowns, but the plunge also revealed an uncomfortable truth: even when transport, industry and commerce grind to a halt, the majority of emissions remain intact. Far greater systemic change is needed, particularly in energy generation around the world, to meet the Paris goals.\nBan Ki-moon, former UN secretary-general, told the Guardian: “We have lost a lot of time. Five years after the agreement in Paris was adopted with huge expectations and commitment by world leaders, we have not done enough.”\nWhat’s more, we are still digging up and burning fossil fuels at a frantic rate. Unep reported last week that production of fossil fuels is planned to increase by 2% a year. Meanwhile, we continue to destroy the world’s carbon sinks, by cutting down forests – the world is still losing an area of forest the size of the UK each year, despite commitments to stop deforestation – as well as drying out peatlands and wetlands, and reducing the ocean’s capacity to absorb carbon from the air.\nGlobal temperatures have already risen by more than 1C above pre-industrial levels, and the results in extreme weather are evident around the world. Wildfires raged across Australia and the US this year, more than 30 hurricanes struck, heatwaves blasted Siberia, and the Arctic ice is melting faster.\nAntónio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, put it in stark terms: “Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back – and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes.”\nBut to judge Paris solely by these portents of disaster would be to lose sight of the remarkable progress that has been made on climate change since. This year, renewable energy will make up about 90% of the new energy generation capacity installed around the world, according to the International Energy Agency, and by 2025 will be the biggest source of power, displacing coal. That massive increase reflects rapid falls in the price of wind turbines and solar panels, which are now competitive or cheaper than fossil fuel generation in many countries, even without subsidy.\n“We never expected to see prices come down so fast,” said Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission and former chief of the UK’s committee on climate change. “We have done better than the most optimistic forecasts.”\nOil prices plunged this spring as coronavirus lockdowns grounded planes and swept cities free of cars, and some analysts predict that the oil business will never recover its old hegemony. Some oil companies, including BP and Shell, now plan to become carbon-neutral.\nElectric vehicles have also improved much faster than expected, reflected in the stunning share price rise of Tesla. The rise of low-carbon technology has meant that when the Covid-19 crisis struck, leading figures quickly called for a green recovery, and set out plans for ensuring the world “builds back better”.\nMost importantly, the world has coalesced around a new target, based on the Paris goals but not explicit in the accord: net zero emissions. In the last two years, first a trickle and now a flood of countries have come forward with long-term goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to a fraction of their current amount, to the point where they are equal to or outweighed by carbon sinks, such as forests.\nThe UK, EU member states, Norway, Chile and a host of developing nations led the way in adopting net zero targets. In September, China’s president surprised the world by announcing his country would achieve net zero emissions in 2060. Japan and South Korea quickly followed suit. US president-elect Joe Biden has also pledged to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050. That puts more than two thirds of the global economy under pledges to reach net zero carbon around mid-century.\nIf all of these countries meet their targets, the world will be almost on track to meet the upper limit of the Paris agreement. Climate Action Tracker, which analyses carbon data, has calculated that the current pledges would lead to a temperature rise of 2.1C, bringing the world within “striking distance” of fulfilling the 2015 promise.\nNiklas Hohne of NewClimate Institute, one of the partner organisations behind Climate Action Tracker, said: “Five years on, it’s clear the Paris agreement is driving climate action. Now we’re seeing a wave of countries signing up [to net zero emissions]. Can anyone really afford to miss catching this wave?”\nThe key issue, though, is whether countries will meet these long-term targets. Making promises for 2050 is one thing, but major policy changes are needed now to shift national economies on to a low-carbon footing. “None of these [net zero] targets will be meaningful without very aggressive action in this decade of the 2020s,” said Todd Stern. “I think there is growing, but not yet broad enough, understanding of that reality.”\nRenewing the shorter term commitments in the Paris agreement will be key. As well as the overarching and legally binding limit of 1.5C or 2C, governments submitted non-binding national plans at Paris to reduce their emissions, or to curb the projected rise in their emissions, in the case of smaller developing countries. The first round of those national plans – called nationally determined contributions – in 2015 were inadequate, however, and would lead to a disastrous 3C of heating.\nThe accord also contained a ratchet mechanism, by which countries must submit new national plans every five years, to bring them in line with the long-term goal, and the first deadline is now looming on 31 December. UN climate talks were supposed to take place this November in Glasgow, but had to be postponed because of the pandemic. The UK will host the Cop26 summit next November instead, and that will be the crucial meeting.\nThe signs for that decisive moment are good, according to Laurent Fabius. The election of Biden in the US means it will be aligned with the EU and China in pushing for net zero emissions to be fully implemented. “We shall have the conjunction of the planets which made possible the Paris agreement,” Fabius told the Guardian. “Civil society, politics, business all came together for the Paris agreement. We are looking at the same conjunction of the planets now with the US, the EU, China, Japan – if the big ones are going in the right direction, there will be a very strong incentive for all countries to go in the right direction.”\nAs host of the Cop26 talks, the UK is redoubling its diplomatic efforts towards next year’s conference. The French government brought all of its diplomatic might to bear on Paris, instructing its ambassadors in every country to make climate change their top priority, and sending out ministers around the globe to drum up support.\nLaurence Tubiana, France’s top diplomat at the talks, said another key innovation was what she termed “360 degree diplomacy”. That means not just working through the standard government channels, with ministerial meetings and chats among officials, but reaching out far beyond, making businesses, local government and city mayors, civil society, academics and citizens part of the talks.\n“That was a very important part of [the success] of Paris,” she said. The UK has taken up a similar stance, with a civil society forum to ensure people’s voices are heard, and a specially convened council of young people advising the UN secretary-general. The UK’s high-level champion, Nigel Topping, is also coordinating a “race to zero” by which companies, and non-state actors such as cities, states and sub-national governments are also committing to reach net zero emissions.\nOne massive issue outstanding ahead of Cop26 is finance. Bringing developing countries, which have suffered the brunt of a problem that they did little to cause, into the Paris agreement was essential. Key to that, said Fabius, was the pledge of financial assistance The French government had to reassure poorer nations at the talks that $100bn a year in financial assistance, for poor countries to cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis, would be forthcoming. “Money, money, money,” Fabius insisted, was at the heart of the talks. “If you don’t have that $100bn [the talks will fail].”\nFor the UK as hosts of Cop26, the question of money presents more of a problem since the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, swung his axe at the overseas aid budget in the recent spending review. Although the £11bn designated for climate aid will be ringfenced, persuading other developed countries to part with cash – and showing developing countries that the UK is on their side – has suddenly become more difficult. Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said: “A country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now.”\nAlok Sharma, president of Cop26 and the UK’s business secretary, will draw on his experience as the UK’s former international development minister in dealing with developing countries’ expectations. He said: “I completely recognise making sure we have the finance for climate change action is very important. That’s why we have protected international climate finance. I think people understand we are in a difficult economic situation. We have said when the economy recovers we would look to restore [overseas aid as 0.7% of GDP]. I do think when it comes to climate change we are putting our best foot forward.”\nBoris Johnson will be hoping to smooth over these tricky issues when he, alongside the French government and the UN, presides over a virtual meeting of world leaders this weekend, on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the Paris accord. At least 70 world leaders are expected to attend, and they will be pushed to bring forward new NDCs and other policy commitments, as a staging post toward the Cop26 summit.\nJohnson kicked off preparations for the meeting last Friday by announcing the UK’s own NDC, setting out a 68% cut in emissions compared with 1990 levels, by 2030. That would put the UK ahead of other developed economies, cutting emissions further and faster than any G20 country has yet committed to do.\nCritics pointed out, however, that the UK is not on track to meet its own current climate targets, for 2023. Far more detailed policy measures are likely to be required, some of them involving major changes and economic losers as well as winners, before the path to net zero is clear.\nThe world is facing the task of a global economic reboot after the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic. The green recovery from that crisis is itself in need of rescue, Guardian analysis has shown, as countries are still pouring money into fossil fuel bailouts. But with so many countries now committed to net zero emissions, and an increasing number coming forward with short term targets for 2030 to set us on that path, there are still grounds for optimism. This week’s climate ambition summit will be an important milestone, but the Cop26 summit next year will be the key test. The Paris agreement five years on still provides the best hope of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown: the question is whether countries are prepared to back it up with action, rather than more hot air."

    "raw_text": "The fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative aims to sidestep slow-moving UN climate talks by gathering together nations, cities and companies that want to rapidly phase out oil, coal and gas. At the coming Cop30 summit in Belém, it hopes to gather support so it can launch negotiations for a new treaty next year. The group’s founder, Tzeporah Berman, explains why the Amazon rainforest and the global south are an ideal springboard for the movement.\nWhy will you be campaigning for a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty?\nWe have to change the way people think about oil, gas and coal, which are responsible for 86% of the carbon dioxide emissions that are trapped in our atmosphere. The world is on track to produce 110% more oil, gas and coal by 2030 than we can ever burn if we want to keep global warming below 2C [above preindustrial levels]. That’s because the market is distorted by trillions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies.\nAnd it’s only getting worse because every country is trying to artificially keep alive their fossil fuel industries, even though they know the damage they cause. At Cop30, we will be working to expand the group of countries participating in the development of the treaty.\nWhat do you say to those who say a non-proliferation treaty is unfeasible anytime soon?\nChange starts that way. When we first talked about renewable energy, people literally laughed at us because it was so expensive. But we’ve seen a tremendous change in technology and in prices so that today we are powering whole countries with renewable energy. Every day, we see major breakthroughs. Last year, one in five cars sold on the planet was electric. We can change very quickly when we want to.\nYes, the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty is a big new idea, but at this moment in history, with floods, fires and heatwaves sweeping the planet, we need big new ideas.\nWhat progress have you made since the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative was founded?\nThe push to negotiate a treaty is endorsed by more than 4,000 civil society groups including all of the world’s major faith, health, women’s and climate organisations. More than 120 cities have passed motions to support the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty and they are increasingly being joined by subnational governments such as California. We also now have 101 Nobel laureates and over 3,000 scientists who have endorsed the treaty. This growing movement helps create the political space for more countries to join.\nSo far 17 countries are participating in the development of the treaty. In addition, 10 countries have been attending senior officials meetings as observers and are showing significant interest and we hope there will be another string of announcements at and before Belém.\nBut what are the prospects of achieving a critical mass?\nTreaties for landmines and chemical weapons started with a core group of just 20 to 30 countries who wanted ambitious, binding rules. That shifted the social norm so it became unacceptable to stockpile those weapons even for many nations who were not signatories to those treaties.\nToday, fossil fuels are our weapons of mass destruction. They kill more people on this planet every year than anything else. Even before we calculate the toll from climate change, air pollution alone kills 8 million people each year. Fossil fuels are the greatest threat to human life.\nWe expect to have enough countries next year to begin negotiations. Before and during Cop30 we will be hosting major meetings of senior officials and ministers mapping the pathway toward negotiations, including the key convenings and conferences that need to be held in that process in the months ahead and we hope there will be a significant announcement on progress at Belém, so look out.\nThis goes beyond the traditional left-right divide, doesn’t it?\nFor me, this all started with the conversations I had in Canada with the oil industry over the tar sands in Alberta. The Trudeau government back then would say: “We know we need to reduce emissions and the world is going to get off fossil fuels but our oil is ethical,” even though the tar sands produce some of the heaviest carbon in the world.\nI later realised that whether you’re in Norway or Ecuador or Argentina, it’s the same conversation. Every company wants to produce the last barrel sold. So every year we miss our emissions reduction targets and every year we drill for more oil, we frack for more gas and we dig up more coal. And then we wonder why the system isn’t changing, even though renewable energy is cheaper.\nAs long as there is no supply side climate policy, then we are trying to cut with one half of the scissors by solely focusing on reducing demand. This is true even with supposedly progressive climate leaders in office, such as Trudeau in Canada, Biden in the US or Starmer in Britain. The system has been designed in such a way that, domestically, elected officials don’t feel responsible for constraining production. That means we are continuing to put our intellectual, financial and political capital towards expanding a system that we say we’re phasing out. And it is almost always the case that what we build today will be what we use tomorrow.\nWhy do you think the Brazilian climate summit is the place to expand this dialogue?\nIndigenous nations in the heart of the Amazon campaigned to keep fossil fuels in the ground long before anywhere in the global north. It has now spread across the world from Standing Rock and the tar sands in the US to anti-coal campaigns in Australia and Europe.\nIn the run-up to Belém, we’ve been working with indigenous nations and associations across the region to promote the idea of a fossil-free Amazon zone so it can be a model for other parts of the world. We have tremendous support from civil society and significant backing from countries. Colombia was the first to endorse a fossil-free Amazon – a commitment to no oil and gas exploration and extraction in the region – and a global fossil fuel treaty, and it is doing diplomatic outreach to other countries.\nHow do you tackle climate justice issues?\nFor the last several years, we’ve been commissioning studies looking at how to apply equity and finance principles to a negotiation on fossil fuel production: who gets to produce and for how long? This takes in historical responsibility, just transition, social justice and levels of fossil fuel dependency.\nBrazil – the biggest nation in the Amazon region – has just sold more than 100 oil and gas exploration blocks, including some offshore from the rainforest. How do you make it worthwhile for countries such as Brazil and leaders such as Lula to give up on fossil fuels?\nAt this moment in history, leadership is important. What Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, said when he joined the fossil fuel treaty was that the science is clear: no new fossil fuel expansion fits in a world where we meet our climate targets. The International Energy Agency has said the same and so has the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The international court of justice has now suggested that is not only a scientific finding but a legal obligation.\nIt’s absurd that there’s this constant drumbeat of pledges and speeches to protect the Amazon, to support Lula and other leaders in the Amazon while, at the same time, financing new oil drilling in the heart of the rainforest, in the mouth of the river, and then buying that oil. We need responsibility along the entire chain and we need more than press releases and empty pledges. We need support for Lula and other leaders to move forward with protecting the Amazon and stopping drilling.\nHow do you make it worthwhile for countries such as Brazil to give up on drilling particular fields?\nWe’ve formed a finance working group that has experts predominantly from the global south. They’re producing a series of papers on trade agreements, tax agreements, debt relief and market access that would provide countries who have joined the fossil fuel treaty with financial support and benefits, as well as looking at specific just transition funds from the private sector available only to countries participating in the development of the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty.\nA larger question is whether or not fossil fuel development in the global south can eliminate poverty. The plans for expansion in Latin America, south-east Asia and Africa show the fossil fuel industry using these regions as a gas station for the global north: Europe and North America. They are unlikely to provide significant economic revenue or products to the areas that they’re exploiting. There’s a tremendous amount of evidence from the last 50 years to show the legacy is more likely to be poisoned waterways and expensive spills. This has been the case for countries that have had fossil fuel development for decades such as Ecuador or Nigeria. The ecological devastation dramatically diminishes local communities’ abilities to support themselves.\nNew fossil fuel infrastructure has high costs and leads to ongoing dependency whereas renewable energy infrastructure creates independence and greater long-term health and economic benefits. But less than 2% of global finance for renewables was in the global south. It’s great that we have seen a commitment from governments in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to triple renewables, but we need those commitments to be coupled with commitments to decommission existing fossil fuel assets and to ensure money flows into the global south.\nWon’t the likely absence of the US make it difficult to move forward?\nWe don’t expect the US and other major producers to join at this point and that’s fine. That means the treaty being developed will be strong and built by those committed to ambitious action commensurate with the science calling for absolute decline of emissions and production.\nThe far right is already on the offensive against net zero [emissions targets]. Won’t the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty initiative give them an even bigger target?\nPoliticians can talk about the benefits and costs of fossil fuels and renewable energy all they want, but the real benefit for real people is that the sun doesn’t send you a bill at the end of the month. When we build renewable energy infrastructure, that means energy is free for life. Make no mistake about it, renewables are not just a different way of powering our cars and our homes; they’re about changing power in every sense of the word."

    "raw_text": "The vast majority of governments are likely to miss a looming deadline to file vital plans that will determine whether or not the world has a chance of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown.\nDespite the urgency of the crisis, the UN is relatively relaxed at the prospect of the missed date. Officials are urging countries instead to take time to work harder on their targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions and divest from fossil fuels.\nSimon Stiell, the UN’s top climate official, said in a speech in Brazil on Thursday: “Because these national plans are among the most important policy documents governments will produce this century, their quality should be the paramount consideration … Taking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense, properly outlining how they will contribute to this effort [to tackle the climate crisis] and therefore what rewards they will reap.”\nNew national plans on emissions cuts are urgently needed because current targets are dangerously inadequate. The world must cut carbon by about half this decade, relative to 1990 levels, to have a chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, the important threshold that scientists fear is already out of reach.\nGovernments are working to blueprints set out four years ago that would result in temperature rises of 2.6C to 2.8C by the end of the century, according to the UN’s environment programme. Poor countries want to see far faster action from the G20 group of the biggest developed and emerging economies, which are responsible for about 80% of global emissions.\nIlana Seid, Palau’s ambassador to the UN and the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: “It is essential that the G20 and other large emitters exhibit their leadership with new [national plans] that show ambitions and tangible progress. We need deep, rapid and sustained reductions commensurate with the 1.5C goal. In this time of unprecedented climate crisis, more than ever we need enhanced international cooperation to truly move the dial forward.”\nAli Mohamed, the chair of the African Group of Negotiators and Kenya’s special envoy for climate change, said: “It is unacceptable that this devastation [that we are seeing] is caused by the pollution of just a few countries, specifically the G20, and they must take responsibility for their actions.”\nGiven the climate emergency – temperatures exceeded 1.5C above preindustrial levels for a whole year in 2024 for the first time – any delay to the deadline would usually be regarded as a crisis. But this year the world is facing a more immediate potential disaster in the US presidency of Donald Trump. Not only has he withdrawn the country from the Paris agreement, he has also embarked on a trade war with the imposition or threat of heavy tariffs on imports.\nThis has thrown important trading relationships, including that with China, into disarray. The disruption to geopolitics, already in turmoil after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza, has alarmed climate diplomats. Many privately believe putting off the publication of national plans, at least until Trump’s initial flurry of activity has died down, is preferable.\nUnder the 2015 Paris climate agreement, every five years countries must submit detailed plans – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – with clear targets on cutting emissions, or curbing them in the case of poorer countries. These are then discussed at a “conference of the parties” (Cop).\nLast time, the deadline was in effect extended by a year: the Cop26 conference in Glasgow was postponed from November 2020 to 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This time, the deadline is technically 10 February – nine months before the Cop30 summit in Brazil this November – but with only a handful of countries so far having submitted plans, it looks likely that most will miss it.\nStiell has urged countries to file their submissions before September, when experts will prepare an official “synthesis report” showing whether the aggregated plans are sufficient to meet the 1.5C limit.\nAmong the dozen or so countries that have submitted their NDCs so far are Brazil, the host of Cop30; the United Arab Emirates, the host of Cop28 in 2023; and the UK, which under the new prime minister, Keir Starmer, has promised to show climate leadership.\nOne of the last acts of Joe Biden as US president was to submit a new NDC, but that is now largely symbolic. It will stand as a benchmark for those US states, local governments and businesses that maintain their climate commitments in defiance of the federal government.\nGiven the impetus in the US behind renewable energy, electric vehicles and other low-carbon technologies, its emissions trajectory may not alter much under Trump for some time. But the impact of his return will be felt far beyond the country’s borders: petrostates and economies that have been laggards in cutting emissions may take cover from his shredding of climate commitments.\nPaul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate adviser now with American University’s Center for Environmental Policy, warned: “Tragically, Trump’s re-election will not only mean the temporary curtailment of US climate ambition, but it will take some pressure off China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and other major traditional scofflaw emitters, who are likely to offer less ambitious NDCs than had Democrats won last November.”\nChina holds the key to Cop30: it is the world’s biggest emitter by a wide margin and responsible for almost a third of global carbon output – more than all of the developed countries combined. It has invested heavily in renewable energy, and the past two years have broken records in additional clean power generation capacity, with that pace likely to continue this year.\nYet emissions are still rising, albeit at a much slower rate. To meet the global carbon budget would require China to cause its emissions to peak this year, then fall by about a third by 2035. Such drastic cuts are possible, experts say. Li Shuo, the director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said: “We believe China is very well positioned to achieve that goal, based on its very rapid low carbon development.”\nWhether China grasps those opportunities will be a political decision. Within Beijing’s top echelons of power, tumultuous arguments rage between those who want to push harder still for the burgeoning green economy, and the advocates of coal. Calculations of the impact of Trump, and his tariffs, will fuel those disagreements further.\n“The US backsliding is definitely not good news for China’s climate ambition and global climate action,” Shuo said. “But China is at the very forefront of the low-carbon economy, which is already yielding a lot of benefits. And China wants to project stability and predictability, on the international stage.”\nChina was at a similar crossroads nearly a decade ago: in early 2016, analysts estimated that China’s emissions may have already peaked. Instead, the country made a sharp reversal by returning to coal-fired power. That process began before the election of Trump in November 2016 but was confirmed by his anti-China stance. Could Trump’s second ascendancy trigger a similar retrenchment? “I would not rule out a return to coal,” Shuo said.\nBernice Lee, a senior adviser at Chatham House, said: “With Trump’s return, there will inevitably be voices – even in China – pushing back against clean energy or arguing against faster decarbonisation. But China has made major investments in clean energy, and its economy is no longer driven solely by coal interests. The signals so far suggest it plans to stay the course.”\nIndia, the world’s fifth largest economy and third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will also be closely watched. After the gavel came down at Cop29 in November, India’s negotiator criticised the $1.3tn climate finance deal agreed there as a “travesty of justice” and “betrayal” of developing countries.\nSolar and wind power are thriving in India, which is the world’s third biggest producer of renewable energy. B, b but the powerful coal lobby enjoys favour with the authoritarian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who argues that developed countries must take responsibility for cutting emissions while the developing world should expand its carbon footprint.\nClimate diplomats told the Guardian it was likely India would frame its targets in terms of emissions intensity rather than absolute cuts to carbon – that is, reducing the amount of carbon per unit of GDP.\nFor most of the past two decades, the EU has led the world on climate ambition. This year, however, with a populist backlash across the continent threatening the environmental consensus, the two biggest champions – France and Germany – are in the throes of political crisis, and several other governments have taken a rightwing and anti-climate turn. The bloc is not expected to reach agreement on its NDC until this summer.\nJapan’s prospective NDC has been criticised by campaigners as too weak but it has not yet been submitted. Canada is facing elections after the resignation of Justin Trudeau, and Australia is also gearing up for political fights over climate in the long run-up to its election.\nThere is little hope of strong NDCs from two of the biggest climate influencers among the G20: Russia and Saudi Arabia. Neither country is likely to commit to significant cuts, although both are nominally signed up to a net zero target.\nEven if China, India, the EU and some other G20 states come forward with relatively strong NDCs, the chances that they will add up globally to the drastic emissions cuts needed to keep the 1.5C target safe are small. Rachel Kyte, the UK’s climate envoy, said: “When you add up all the NDCs, my expectation is they may not get us back on track.”\nBut this need not be the disaster it might appear, she added, as the NDCs could be negotiated and updated. For instance, some NDCs were likely to contain a range of possible targets, some of which might be conditional on countries receiving finance or other support. “These are not static [documents], and the targets are floors, not ceilings,” she said.\nQuite how dynamic countries are prepared to be is up for debate. At Cop26, countries – in theory – agreed that NDCs should be updated more often than every five years. But since then, few have increased the level of ambition in their plans.\nEven if ambition is lacking on the core carbon targets in NDCs, properly focused plans could offer the world a breathing space by going beyond carbon to other greenhouse gases – chiefly methane. Global emissions of methane, which comes from agriculture and escapes from fossil fuel extraction sites, have been rising strongly in recent years, to the increasing concern of scientists, as methane is roughly 80 times more powerful at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.\nCutting methane yields big rewards: halving methane would avoid a 0.25C rise in temperatures by 2030, one study found. Durwood Zaelke, the president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said: “Methane is the emergency brake that can slow down warming enough to keep us from going over the cliff of irreversible tipping points. All countries need to target methane in their NDCs.”\nSome countries already had policies on methane, which should be strengthened, and those without must put them in place, he said. “Our window to act is the next five years, 10 tops. If we don’t cut methane now, we’ll see the rate of warming continue to accelerate, and we’ll soon be past the first series of irreversible tipping points.”\nNDCs are detailed documents, going far beyond the headline emissions targets. Experts also want them to address the global imperative to “transition away from fossil fuels”, agreed at Cop28. All countries are supposed to be tripling their renewable energy generation and doubling energy efficiency, but so far those targets are being missed.\nKyte said governments should see NDCs as an economic opportunity. “NDCs should be investable plans,” she said. “And investable plans for sustainable development can be NDCs.”"

    "raw_text": "“Climate is our biggest war. Climate is here for the next 100 years. We need to focus and … not allow those [other] wars to take our attention away from the bigger fight that we need to have.”\nAna Toni, the chief executive of Cop30, the UN climate summit to be held in Brazil this November, is worried. With only four months before the crucial global summit, the world’s response to the climate crisis is in limbo.\nFewer than 30 of the 200 countries that will gather in the Amazonian city of Belém have drafted plans, required by the 2015 Paris agreement, to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown.\nAnd that crisis is escalating. In the last two years, for the first time, global land temperatures soared to more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – breaching the limit that governments have promised at multiple climate meetings to keep.\nMeanwhile, the US president, Donald Trump, has withdrawn from the Paris agreement and is intent on expanding fossil fuels and dismantling carbon-cutting efforts. The EU is mired in tense arguments over its plans. China, the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, is rumoured to be considering weak targets that would condemn the world to much greater heating.\nAnd the attention of world leaders is elsewhere, as the conflict in the Middle East threatens to spiral further. Poor countries are labouring under a mountain of debt, and the continuing cost of living crisis in many countries is fuelling populism and a backlash against green policy.\nToni, a respected Brazilian economist, told the Guardian: “There’s no doubt that the wars that we’ve seen – military wars and trade wars … are very damaging – physically, economically, socially – and they divert the direction and the attention from climate.”\nVulnerable countries fear their concerns will be lost amid the push for militarisation. “Spending more on defence means spending less on climate,” said Michai Robertson, adviser to the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis).\nBut the questions for Belém cannot be ignored. Can the world cut greenhouse gas emissions far enough and fast enough to stabilise global temperatures? Is the lack of progress inevitable when hundreds of countries are trying to agree a way forward, or are more sinister forces at play, trying to throw up roadblocks? Has a recent meeting in Bonn done anything to bring more resolution and collaboration?\nBeyond 1.5C of heating, the impacts of climate chaos – heatwaves, sea level rises, species die-offs, droughts, floods and storms – will rapidly become catastrophic and irreversible. And we now know that the world could already be traversing vital “tipping points”, beyond which runaway climate change will be impossible to recover from within human timeframes.\nAnna Rasmussen, the chief negotiator for Aosis, said: “Around the world, the ‘unprecedented’ has become our new norm. The economics of small island states are stymied by disasters we did not cause. Not even a year ago, the Caribbean was ravaged by Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic ever recorded.”\nNationally determined contributions\nSince the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise. Temperatures are affected by the cumulative quantity of carbon in the atmosphere, so every additional tonne counts: scientists have now calculated that we can only carry on producing current levels of carbon dioxide for two more years, ensuring the breach of the 1.5C limit becomes permanent.\nBut while temperatures have soared, and weather records have tumbled, any sense of urgency inside the negotiating halls seems to have cooled. Two weeks of preliminary talks, intended to lay the groundwork for Cop30, have just finished in Bonn. They started two days late because countries could not agree an agenda, and ended without clear negotiating texts for the key points.\nSome of the frustrating lack of progress is inevitable, as countries grapple with geopolitics and the complexity of getting nearly 200 governments in line. But several negotiators told the Guardian they saw more sinister motives in play – deliberate attempts by some recalcitrant countries or their allies, usually fossil fuel producers, to throw up roadblocks.\n“These are not accidents we are seeing, they are attempts to slow things down, no question,” said one. At one point, according to an observer, a key discussion degenerated into speculation about the buttons on a putative website presenting data, rather than addressing the substantive points.\nAt the core of the Cop30 summit will be the national plans on emissions. Known as “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs), these are the bedrock of the Paris agreement, setting out not just overall targets on how far governments intend to cut emissions over the next decade, but also indicating what measures might be taken in different sectors to meet those goals, such as boosting renewable energy or improving efficiency.\nThe Brazilian hosts of the Cop30 summit are urging governments to finish their NDCs by September, so the UN can assess them ahead of the scheduled start of Cop30 in November.\n“We are really far from where we need to go, even in quantity of NDCs, let alone how ambitious [they are] and the quality of them,” Toni told the Guardian. “I don’t think there is any excuse [for countries not to come up with new NDCs]. We are expecting NDCs that are improved, both in terms of ambitions and on their quality.”\nMost closely watched will be China. The world’s second biggest economy and biggest emitter of greenhouse gases is also the global renewable energy powerhouse. China’s green economy has outstripped all expectations, with about a third of electricity now coming from clean sources, and renewable generation capacity on track to double by 2030, compared with 2022 levels.\nChina is also the biggest exporter of renewable energy components and electric vehicles, so stands to benefit from other countries setting stiffer targets on emissions. Experts believe that China could halve its emissions by 2035 without difficulty – yet the government is thought to be considering tabling reductions of only about 10%.\nCoal is the reason. While coal fell to its lowest share of electricity generation on record in May 2024, this year a surge of approvals of new coal-fired power plants, and investment in mining, has alarmed analysts.\nGao Yuhe, of Greenpeace East Asia, said China could cause its emissions to peak this year if renewable energy growth continues. “The year 2025 marks a pivotal moment in the country’s energy transition,” she said. “There is already enough existing capacity to meet today’s peak demand. Approving a new wave of large-scale coal projects risks creating overcapacity, stranded assets, and higher transition costs. That will ultimately undermine progress toward a cleaner, more flexible power system.”\nThe EU is locked in tense negotiations over its carbon target for 2040, which will be thrashed out next week. That target, which is expected to involve a cut in carbon of at least 90% compared with 1990 levels, would be the steepest yet presented, but arguments are raging over whether, and how much of, this could be met by trading carbon credits with other countries. When the 2040 figure is agreed, it must then also be translated into a commensurate 2035 goal – the end date for the current commitment period under the Paris agreement – and published along with further policy details as a fully fledged NDC in September.\nOther countries, including major emerging economies such as India, are still to submit their plans. “There is a lot of watching and waiting going on,” says Arunabha Ghosh, the chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a prominent thinktank in India and one of the Cop30 envoys chosen by Brazil to support the aims of the talks. “We should be judging countries on implementation – climate leaders are those who get things done, rather than those who say things.”\nA few countries have already presented their NDCs. The UK’s is judged to be fairly ambitious, with an 81% cut in emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2035. Canada’s effort and Japan’s have both been found “insufficient”, however, by the Climate Action Tracker, which monitors the levels of countries’ emissions reduction.\nA further problem is that none of the NDCs so far, which are pegged to 2035 or 2040, have contained revisions of countries’ existing near-term targets. Current NDCs, set at Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, are inadequate to stay within 1.5C. At Glasgow, countries agreed that the “ratchet” – the system for updating NDCs – should allow for the upward revision of targets more frequently than the five-yearly system laid out in the Paris agreement.\nDisappointingly, no countries have availed themselves of the opportunity, said Niklas Höhne, of the NewClimate Institute. “[To stay within the 1.5C limit] needs drastic reductions. None of the NDCs on the table have updated 2030 numbers. But if we do not do more by 2030, it will be very difficult to catch up later.”\nLast year’s conference of the parties (Cop) focused on finance, and that will also play a major role this year. Developing countries need assistance from the rich world, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. At Cop29, they were assured of $1.3tn a year by 2035, with $300bn of this coming in the form of public finance from developed countries.\nThose numbers will be harder to reach now that the US has pulled out of climate finance and other forms of overseas aid. Poor countries want to see concrete plans for how the financial flows will be reached, and Brazil is working with last year’s host, Azerbaijan, on a “Baku to Belém roadmap” due in October.\nYalchin Rafiyev, the chief negotiator for Azerbaijan at Cop29 last year in Baku, warned that not enough was being done to meet the financial commitments made last year, particularly from the taxpayer-funded development banks. “We have seen very low-profile engagement of MDBs [multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank] in climate-related issues,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “We have opened the Baku to Belém roadmap to $1.3tn for wider stakeholders for their written submissions. So far, we have received 102 submissions, and only two of them are from MDBs. That’s quite surprising, because they have always expressed their interest to be part of the process.”\nJuan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, the chief negotiator for Panama, said being able to show substantial progress on finance was crucial. “We need to define what is the roadmap to close the finance gap towards developing nations, because if we don’t address that, if we don’t fill that gap, if we don’t provide these resources, then we cannot expect developing nations to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement,” he said. “It’s all about the money.”\nBrazil’s agenda for Cop30 also gives little room for what many activists still see as the key question: fossil fuels. At Cop28, in Dubai, countries made a landmark commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels”. At Cop29, attempts to flesh that out with a timeframe and details of what it would mean were stymied by opposition from petrostates, including Saudi Arabia.\nActivists had hoped to bring the commitment back to Cop30, to be elaborated and formalised into a coherent plan that countries would sign up to. But Brazil appears wary of reopening the debate, and would prefer to regard such past resolutions as settled. The presidency has been resistant even to the idea of a “cover text”, the catch-all outcome document that in most Cops captures the key resolutions.\nAt Bonn, it was not clear where in the Cop30 agenda it would be possible to discuss the transition away from fossil fuels. “We tried to get to discuss it [in various forums] but we keep getting it moved away,” said Stela Herschmann, of the Observatório do Clima network of civil society groups in Brazil. “It’s like nobody wants us.”\nDespite the frustrations of the last two weeks of pre-talks in Bonn, the goodwill that Brazil enjoys as host nation was much in evidence. The presidency has drawn on expertise from around the world, creating a “circle” of the former Cop presidents since the Paris agreement was forged in 2015, a “circle” of finance ministers from around the world, and a group of economists. Indigenous people will play a key role, with a “global ethical stocktake” intended to reflect their concerns, involving Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, and well-known climate activists including Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland. Brazil has also set out an “action agenda” to track progress on initiatives from previous Cops and to foreground key issues related to the climate crisis, such as food and agriculture, forestry and nature, water, oceans, social justice and equity.\nThe irony is that the most substantive issue of Cop30 – the NDCs – will be out of Brazil’s hands, decided in national capitals long before any leaders hop on planes for Belém. “We don’t negotiate NDCs at Cops – this is nationally determined, so what we will have at Cop30 is the report of those nationally determined decisions that have been taken,” said Toni. “And yes, that can be frustrating. There can be a good picture or very bad picture, we will see, but it will be a reflection of national politics more than anything. We are obviously the designated president of Cop30, but it is a collective responsibility.”"

    "raw_text": "EU member states may be allowed to count controversial carbon credits from developing countries towards their climate targets, the European climate commissioner has said as states meet for a crucial decision on the issue.\nThe EU will discuss on Wednesday its target for slashing carbon dioxide by 2040, with an expected cut of 90% compared with 1990 levels, in line with the bloc’s overarching target of reaching net zero by mid-century.\nIf agreed by member states, and passed by the EU parliament, that goal is then supposed to be translated into an international target – known as a nationally determined contribution (NDC) – pegged to 2035, under the Paris agreement.\nBut green groups are furious over proposals that would allow part of the target to be made up from buying carbon offsets from overseas. They argue that the EU should meet its targets domestically. More than 130 groups wrote to express “extreme concern” over the proposals last month.\nGareth Redmond-King, the international lead at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, said: “There is no need for them to use credits. If such a major emitter is not going as far as they demonstrably could with emissions cuts, then the overall global ambition is lower than it could be. This would risk undermining the EU’s reputation for climate leadership at a time when that leadership is most needed.”\nWopke Hoekstra, the EU climate commissioner, told the Guardian that developing countries were keen to gain EU financing through carbon credits, for projects such as tree planting or forest restoration, and that it was possible to ensure that such offsets resulted in genuine emissions reductions. He said the possibility of allowing this was “potentially very attractive”.\n“The planet doesn’t care about where we take emissions out of the air,” he said. “You need to take action everywhere, but it certainly also helps to do that both here and elsewhere.”\nHe said developing countries in Africa and Latin America were interested in carbon credit projects. “There is huge appetite from our friends in the global south,” he said.\nBut such projects would have to be in addition to actions developing countries were already taking to meet their own emissions targets, rather than replacing them. “If it is additional, I think it is a great idea,” he said. “And what we will not have a shortage of is ambition to do stuff at the same time in Europe. There’s no one who doubts the very significant level of ambition [for emissions cuts within the EU].”\nHoekstra acknowledged there had been problems in the past with carbon credits that were found to be worthless. “It all stands or falls with the integrity of such a system, where certification, verification [of carbon credits], is absolutely essential,” he said. “But humanity has solved more difficult problems.”\nWednesday’s talks on a 2040 emissions target could also be derailed by a small number of member states, led by France, mooting “decoupling” the domestic target from the NDC. They argue that the NDC, with its 2035 emissions target, could be delivered in September without the 2040 figure being agreed, implying that a less ambitious 2040 goal could be agreed at a later date.\nHoekstra was firm. “We will come up this Wednesday with our 2040 climate target, and from that we will derive an ambitious NDC,” he said. “And I am confident that we will deliver that exact number by September, as we were asked for by the secretary general of the UN.”\nAll countries are expected to lay out their NDC before Cop30, the crunch climate summit in Brazil this November, but few have yet done so. China’s NDC will be crucial, especially as Donald Trump has taken the US out of the Paris agreement.\nHoekstra attacked China for planning to build new coal-fired power plants, which he said was “against what was agreed at Cop28”, when countries resolved to “transition away from fossil fuels”. He said: “Building new ones is a very bad idea.”\nIt is unlikely that the NDCs presented at Cop30 in Belém will be sufficient to prevent temperatures breaching the vital threshold of 1.5C above preindustrial levels contained in the Paris agreement.\nThe Brazilian hosts of the meeting have said NDCs will not be negotiated at Cop30. But Hoekstra said the summit must come up with an answer for how to bridge any gap between the commitments made and the 1.5C limit.\n“It’s difficult to leave that proverbial elephant in the room and not discuss it. We do need to have political space to discuss the impact of the NDCs and the way forward.”"

    "raw_text": "For most of the past 30 years, the EU has led the world on climate action. The bloc had the deepest reductions in greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto protocol; the first climate laws came from EU member states; the first emissions trading scheme, in 2005; and the Paris agreement in 2015.\nAt times when other major countries – the US, Japan, Canada, China and India at various points – have stepped back, the EU has often stepped forward. There would be no Paris accord had the bloc not won a key battle at the Durban climate summit in 2011 that paved the way.\nFor Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, that era is over. Europe would still lead, he said, but other countries must come forward too.\n“[We should be] looking forward to contributions from more than just the EU, given that we’re responsible for 6% of global emissions, so without others we’re not going to solve this,” he said in an interview before the publication of the commission’s proposal for a 2040 emissions target on Wednesday. “Much as I appreciate the high expectations [of EU leadership], it is extremely important to contextualise this. We will continue with clearly ambitious yet also pragmatic climate policies.”\nThe commission has proposed a 90% reduction on greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, compared with 1990 levels. The figure is at the bottom of the 90-95% range that the bloc’s scientific advisers said was possible, and to the consternation of many green campaigners includes a provision for up to 3% of the reductions to come from buying carbon credits overseas, from 2036.\nMohamed Adow, the director of the Nairobi-based thinktank Power Shift Africa, said: “The EU using carbon credits in its 2040 target is a huge concern and will undermine trust at a time [when] we need Europe to be stepping into the void left by the US. Carbon credits are a mirage, an accounting trick to let the rich world keep on burning fossil fuels whilst pretending climate change is being tackled somewhere else in the world.”\nThe idea also has some support, however. Rebecca Humphries, the head of climate policy for Europe at the Nature Conservancy, said: “Carbon markets, when done right, can lead to faster and more effective climate progress.”\nThe proposal must still pass key hurdles: it could face opposition in the EU parliament, and some member states have signalled they may try to maul it. Those include the predictably climate-sceptic Hungary, but also – astoundingly, on the 10th anniversary of the Paris agreement – France.\nEmmanuel Macron has suggested the 2040 target could be delayed, by separating it from the EU’s discussions on a fresh target on emissions under the Paris agreement, called a nationally determined contribution (NDC), covering the next decade. The UN secretary general has asked all countries to submit NDCs in September, after most missed a February deadline, to allow them to be presented at a crunch climate summit, Cop30, this November in Brazil.\nThe EU’s NDC, pegged to 2035, is supposed to be derived from the 2040 proposal. Allowing them to be separated would give more time for debate on the later goal – debate demanded mainly by those who wish to weaken it.\nEuropean centrist leaders face a populist threat, and backlash against green policy. Macron’s stance, and Hoekstra’s comments on EU leadership, must be seen in that context.\nBut giving in to populist rhetoric may be counterproductive. Polls show that most people in the EU remain firmly in favour of strong climate measures. Amélie Laurent, policy adviser at the Bellona Europe thinktank, said: “With most Europeans recognising climate change as a serious threat and supporting climate neutrality by 2050, it is crystal clear that citizens demand meaningful climate action. EU policymakers must listen to their citizens and deliver the targets needed to meet this mandate.”\nThe EU’s policies will also have an effect internationally. Cosima Cassel, programme lead for climate diplomacy and geopolitics at the E3G thinktank in Berlin, said the EU’s NDC would be crucial in galvanising other economic heavyweights to play their part. “A timely NDC submission would send a clear signal to other major emitters including China, India, Japan, Australia and Mexico to step up their own ambition ahead of Cop30.”\nChina, the world’s biggest emitter, will be critical – whether Beijing goes for a 10% cut in emissions by 2035, as some have suggested, or the 30% to 50% cut that others calculate is feasible, will be the biggest determinant of success at Cop30 in Belém.\nThe EU is holding key meetings with China in the coming weeks, and Hoekstra has criticised the Chinese for building new coal-fired power plants. But at least China is helping to drive global takeup of clean technology at a rapid rate. India is also surging ahead in renewable energy, and is now the world’s third-biggest producer of solar and wind energy.\nBy contrast, there are very large emitters and exporters of fossil fuels – Russia, Saudi Arabia and now the US – that take little action or have gone backwards on climate commitments.\nThe key question for the EU, and the planet, will be what can be done to bring recalcitrant countries on board at Cop30. Allowing them to exploit the impression that the EU is backing down might prove a boon to the wreckers."

    "raw_text": "A group of the US’s leading climate scientists have compiled a withering review of a controversial Trump administration report that downplays the risks of the climate crisis, finding that the document is biased, riddled with errors and fails basic scientific credibility.\nMore than 85 climate experts have contributed to a comprehensive 434-page report that excoriates a US Department of Energy (DOE) document written by five hand-picked fringe researchers that argues that global heating and its resulting consequences have been overstated.\nThe Trump administration report, released in July, contains “pervasive problems with misrepresentation and selective citation of the scientific literature, cherry-picking of data, and faulty or absent statistics”, states the new analysis, which is written in the style of the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.\n“This report makes a mockery of science,” said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University.\n“It relies on ideas that were rejected long ago, supported by misrepresentations of the body of scientific knowledge, omissions of important facts, arm waving, anecdotes and confirmation bias. This report makes it clear DOE has no interest in engaging with the scientific community.”\nAnother reviewing academic, Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, an environmental scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, said he was “shocked and appalled” by the “total disgrace” of the Donald Trump report and was willing to join with other volunteer researchers from leading institutions to correct the record.\nThe review will be submitted as part of a public comment period on the report, which closes on Tuesday.\nChris Wright, the US energy secretary, has said the report pushes back against the “cancel culture Orwellian squelching of science” and that the five authors were not ordered what to write.\nHowever, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists have condemned the “farce” of the exercise, pointing out it has been used to justify the administration’s rollback of climate regulations, rather than act as legitimate scientific inquiry.\n“Setting aside several weeks of time to join dozens of other scientists in an effort to correct the cherry-picked data in a US government report wasn’t on my bingo card this summer,” said Andra Garner, a climate scientist at Rowan University. “But it is clearly what the situation required.”\nReached for comment, DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said: “Unlike previous administrations, the Trump administration is committed to engaging in a more thoughtful and science-based conversation about climate change and energy.”\nThe four main critiques contained in the climate scientists’ review are:\nAuthors\nThe problems with the new DOE assessment began when the agency hand-picked five climate contrarians to author it, the analysis says.\nThey include John Christy, an atmospheric scientist who has said the climate crisis could be positive; Judith Curry, a climatologist who rails against climate “alarmism”; Steven E Koonin, a physicist who has called climate science “unsettled”; Ross McKitrick, an economist who has said the climate crisis is not a “big issue”; and Roy Spencer, a meteorologist and climate scientist who has said top scientists overblow the impact society has on the climate.\nIn the DOE report, Wright says the authors were chosen “for their rigor, honesty, and willingness to elevate the debate”. But each one is “well known for manufacturing uncertainty”, the new review states.\nBy selecting these authors, the Trump administration appears to be violating a 1972 law requiring balanced perspectives within executive advisory committees, the new review says.\n“[T]his group appears to have been personally recruited by the Secretary of Energy to advance a particular viewpoint favored by DOE leadership,” the analysis says.\nPeer review and transparency\nFederal advisory committee members are subject to transparency laws aimed at promoting citizen input and accountability, the analysis notes, but the group’s convenings happened in secret, and their work was withheld from the public.\nUnder Office of Management and Budget rules, such assessments are also meant to be subject to peer review. But no such review has yet occurred, the authors note.\n“When it became clear that DOE wasn’t going to organize such a review, the scientific community came together on its own, in less than a month, to provide it,” said Robert Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who has said the DOE report misrepresented his research.\nThe working group’s process also violated the stated aims of the Trump administration, they say. In a May executive order, the president said only peer-reviewed science that is conducted in a conflict-free and transparent manner should underpin policies.\n“We should be using scientifically vetted and properly reviewed assessments to make legal decisions – not unreviewed documents that present a distorted view of our scientific knowledge,” said Abigail Swann, a professor of atmospheric sciences and ecology at the University of Washington.\nAsked about these concerns, Dietderich said the DOE report was “reviewed internally by a group of DOE scientific researchers and policy experts from the Office of Science and National Labs” and is now “opened to wider peer review from the scientific community and general public via the public comment period”.\nCherry-picked evidence\nThe Trump administration report selectively reviews scientific literature and plucks small sections to support its arguments, rather than present a full picture of the evidence, the scientists’ review states.\nFor example, the Trump-appointed researchers point to the extreme heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl, while ignoring what was going on in the rest of the world and how this compares to global trends today. Other “cherry-picked” evidence is used to support claims about the role of the strength of the sun in raising Earth temperatures and the sensitivity of the climate to carbon emissions, the review finds.\nAnother section, in which the report looks at climate-driven extreme events, is badly mischaracterized, according to Dessler. “I mean, they just don’t understand what they’re talking about,” he said.\n“Five people were hand-selected by the secretary of energy for their viewpoints, and they produced a shoddy mess of cherry-picked data and unsupported assertions,” said Pamela McElwee, associate professor of human ecology at Rutgers University.\nWhile the DOE report was written in four months, traditional federal and international climate reports – such as the US national climate assessments and IPCC reports – are each authored by hundreds of experts, the new analysis says, “with multiple rounds of internal and external review”.\nBecause the DOE report “covers areas in which the authors are not experts”, their report is riddled with “errors in the report caused by a lack of familiarity with the science”, the assessment says.\nAbout 11% of the DOE report’s citations were written by its own five authors – a share nearly five times higher than the average rate at which authors’ own work was cited in a 2023 IPCC report that 230 experts wrote.\nPredetermined outcome\nThe Department of Energy report was released as part of a Trump administration push to repeal the “endangerment finding” – a landmark 2009 determination that greenhouse gases harm human health.\nThe elimination of this finding by the Environmental Protection Agency would effectively kneecap all US policies designed to cut planet-heating pollution from cars, trucks and power plants. The DOE report is intended to provide cover for this political goal rather than act as a credible work of science, the review found.\nDietderich said the president “values the role of science” and that the administration “have not pre-judged how this report will impact EPA’s proposed Endangerment Finding rulemaking or any policy or program at the Department of Energy”.\nYet by sidelining credible climate scientists and actively promoting the report’s conclusions in draft form, the Trump administration has shown that this work is merely a tool in service of a political goal, the reviewing scientists added.\n“Work contrary to the conclusions of the DOE report is dismissed or simply ignored, making it clear that the report is intended to support a specific policy decision and is not an unbiased synthesis of climate science,” said Christopher Callahan, a climate scientist at Indiana University."

    "raw_text": "A Saudi Arabian delegate has been accused of directly making changes to an official Cop29 negotiating text, it can be revealed.\nCop presidencies usually circulate negotiating texts as non-editable PDF documents to all countries simultaneously, and they are then discussed. Giving one party editing access “risks placing this entire Cop in jeopardy”, one expert said.\nOil-rich Saudi Arabia is regarded by many as a persistent obstructor of action at UN climate summits to cut the burning of fossil fuels and has been described as a “wrecking ball” at Cop29.\nEarlier on Saturday, a document was circulated by the Azerbaijani presidency with updates to the negotiating text on the just transition work program (JTWP). This aims to help countries move to a cleaner and more resilient future, while reducing inequalities.\nThe document was sent with “tracked changes” from the previously circulated version. In two cases, the document showed edits were made directly by Basel Alsubaity, who is from the Saudi ministry of energy and the lead on the JTWP. It was not sent to other countries to edit, the Guardian was told.\nOne of the changes deletes a section of text reading “encourages parties to consider just transition pathways in developing and implementing NDCs, NAPs and LT-LEDSs that are aligned with the outcome of the first global stock take and relevant provisions of the Paris agreement”. (NDCs are nationally determined contributions, NAPs are national adaptation plans and LT-LEDs are long-term low emission development strategies.)\nCatherine Abreu, the director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a Cop veteran, said: “All parties need to see presidency texts during this process as the negotiations proceed and this is generally done by circulating non-editable PDF documents to all parties simultaneously.\n“Giving one party editing access to these documents, and a party known for its objective of rolling back the historic global agreement made last year to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy and energy efficiency, suggests a worrying lack of independence and objectivity, and clearly contravenes both the spirit and the rules of this process,” she said. “This kind of behaviour from a presidency risks placing this entire Cop in jeopardy.”\nTwo groups – the Alliance of Small Island States and the Least Developed Countries – walked out of a key meeting on Saturday, saying they were not being consulted by the presidency.\nThe German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, speaking on Saturday before the editing revelation, said: “We are in the midst of a geopolitical power play by a few fossil fuel states. We will not allow the most vulnerable, especially the small island states, to be ripped off by the few rich fossil fuel emitters who have the backing, unfortunately, at this moment of the president [of Cop29].”\nA 2023 report by the Climate Social Science Network concluded: “One nation has had an outsized role in undermining progress at global climate negotiations, year after year: Saudi Arabia. The fossil fuel giant has a 30-year record of obstruction and delay, protecting its national oil and gas sector and seeking to ensure UN climate talks achieve as little as possible, as slowly as possible.\n“Riyadh’s envoys are among the most active across all tracks of UN climate talks, frequently pushing back on efforts to curb fossil fuels,” it said. “Despite increased temperatures across Saudi Arabia and falling groundwater supplies, Riyadh has shown little sign of shifting strategy.”\nThe Cop29 presidency, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Saudi delegation have been contacted for comment."

    "raw_text": "The first signs of a takeoff of Africa’s green economy are raising hopes that a transformation of the continent’s fortunes may be under way, driven by solar power and an increase in low-carbon investment.\nAfrican leaders are meeting this week in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for the Africa Climate Summit, a precursor to the global UN Cop30 in November. They will call for an increase in support from rich countries for Africa’s green resurgence, without which they will warn it could be fragile and spread unevenly.\nRichard Muyungi, the climate envoy and adviser to the president of Tanzania, said: “Africa is ready to be part of [the global fight to stave off climate breakdown] provided we are supported with finance, technology and capacity-building.\n“There has been an increase of investments in some areas but Africa still needs a lot of financing to be able to be part of the global solution, and to address the challenges we are facing.”\nGreen energy is booming in Africa, with 20 countries breaking records for imports of solar panels in the 12 months to June. According to the thinktank Ember, imports of photovoltaic equipment from China rose by 60% over the past year, from 9MW in 2024 to 15MW of capacity, with a tripling of imports to countries outside South Africa.\nThough the increase is impressive, it is from a low base. Africa, which boasts the greatest potential for solar power, has lagged far behind other countries in installations. Only 4% of global solar generation last year was in Africa, and in 2023, the International Energy Agency reported that Belgium had as many solar panels as the entire continent.\n“There is a glimmer of light [in the increased investment] but this is still quite meagre compared to other continents in the global south,” Muyungi said.\nLast year’s imported panels would add about 5% to current electricity generation capacity in 16 countries, according to Ember, but the need remains vast. About 600 million people in Africa lack access to electricity, and about a billion have only firewood or dirty fuels for cooking. Women and girls are worst affected.\nMelaku Yirga, the regional director for Africa at Mercy Corps, a humanitarian organisation, said: “Renewable energy is not only Africa’s greatest opportunity, it is also an urgent necessity. Renewable power enables everything from irrigation and food storage to early-warning systems, healthcare and livelihoods.”\nWhile recent increases in renewable energy investment were welcome, Yirga said the public sector and overseas aid were still vital.\n“Africa has no shortage of ambition in renewable energy, but without stronger international finance and the right incentives, the private sector will remain on the sidelines and adaptation goals will go unmet,” he said.\n“Private sector financing must be met with public commitments, and funding must also be long-term and reliable – short grants rarely achieve full impact, as meaningful engagement with governments and communities takes time and requires significant upfront investment.”\nReductions in overseas aid from rich countries are causing consternation among African governments, many of which are blighted by record debt burdens, exacerbated by the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and recent interest rate rises.\nMacky Sall, the former president of Senegal, said: “The drop in official development assistance fundamentally changes the climate calculus. Where does that leave Africa, if we can no longer count on our partners’ promises?\n“The costs of the climate crisis have fallen most heavily on Africa. We are not the cause. We are not only footing the largest bill – we are also seeing the cheques to stem the damage cancelled.”\nPrivate sector companies will put cash into renewable energy, but few will help Africa adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis, which are already being felt in the form of droughts, floods and crop failures. Investment to build resilience – such as water storage systems, better infrastructure and new farming techniques – is lacking.\nA report published at the summit on Monday showed that while Africa needed at least $70bn a year to adapt to the effects of the climate crisis, and possibly much more, only $15bn was provided in adaptation finance to the continent in 2023.\nWithout urgent action to address that vast financing gap, Africa’s future costs from climate impacts will balloon, wiping out a fifth of GDP by 2050.\nPatrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation thinktank, says rich countries must increase their finance for adaptation in Africa, which is responsible for only 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions while bearing the brunt of climate breakdown.\n“Europe [and other countries] will shoot themselves in the foot if they defund ODA [official development assistance],” he said. “African leaders will see it as a stab in the back.”\nWhile Africa is behind in climate adaptation, its riches are increasingly sought after by China and the rest of the rich world.\nAfrica has some of the biggest deposits of “critical minerals” – elements vital to building renewable energy components. Cobalt, lithium, copper, nickel, rare earths and other minerals are abundant in parts of Africa, which has spurred a global scramble for the resources.\nHuman rights abuses have soared in some mining areas, with child labour and the exploitation of adult workers, particularly women, in places such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Africa’s under-resourced public sector is struggling to contain the damage and ensure resource extraction is done responsibly, without causing environmental devastation and in a way that benefits local people.\nAfrica also abounds in gas, with reserves of the fossil fuel that have scarcely been tapped in some countries. Muyungi insisted they must be allowed to exploit those resources, despite the impact on the climate crisis. “We do not envisage anything to stop us using gas – we need it for our development,” he said.\nFor rich countries to tackle the climate crisis, Africa’s assistance will be essential. If global north governments fail to address the continent’s needs, they will feel the impact. Roughly 60% of Africa’s population is under 25, a “youthquake” that could spur development or, if poorly handled, will be felt around the world.\nAbay Yimere, a scholar at the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University in the US, said: “If the climate crisis is not tackled in Africa, that will be a problem for migration. If we do not provide them with jobs, and adapt to climate change, the impact will be huge and not controllable. The global north should look at this from their own national perspectives and see where their interest lies.”"

    "raw_text": "An innovative plan to use public money to back renewable energy loans in the developing world could liberate cash from the private sector for urgently needed climate finance.\nAvinash Persaud, a special adviser on climate change to the president of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), who developed the proposals, believes the plan could drive tens of billions of new investment in the fledgling green economy in poorer countries within a few years, and could provide the bulk of the $1.3tn in annual climate finance promised to the developing world by 2035.\n“This could be an engine for green growth, and produce the trillions needed for climate finance in the future,” he told the Guardian. “It could be a transformation.”\nHis ideas will be set out in detail at a UN meeting in Germany this week, kicking off negotiations for the Cop30 climate summit that will take place in Brazil this November against a worrying global background for the discussions.\nHaving missed a deadline in February, the world’s largest economies still need to submit plans for their greenhouse gas emissionsbefore the Brazil summit, but so far only a few have done do so.\nBut research seen by the Guardian, carried out by the campaign group Oil Change International, shows that many developed countries are still planning to expand their extraction of oil and gas, despite promising at Cop28 in 2023 to “transition away from fossil fuels”.\nThe analysis found that the US, Canada, Norway and Australia were responsible for 70% of projected new oil and gas expansion in 2025-35.\nRomain Ioualalen, the global policy lead at Oil Change International, said: “It is sickening that countries with the highest incomes and outsized historical responsibility for causing the climate crisis are planning massive oil and gas expansion with no regard for the lives and livelihoods at stake.”\nAt the two-week meeting in Bonn, which ends on 26 June, the vital issue of finance for developing countries – which they need in order to cut their emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather – will also come to the fore.\nThe proposals by Persaud and others to buy up loans to renewable energy projects in the developing world could allow billions of dollars of private sector cash to flood the sector, in a big boost to global climate finance.\nThe plan, which is being pioneered by the IADB, would involve getting taxpayer-funded development banks to buy existing loans to green projects in poor countries, which would free up investment from private sector lenders.\nSuch loans are relatively low risk because they are already performing – but because they are in developing countries, with credit ratings lower than those of rich states – mainstream private sector investors such as pension funds are often forbidden from touching them because of their strict rules on credit worthiness.\nBut if those loans are backed instead by development banks, which can provide guarantees against default, and which themselves have impeccable credit ratings, the “repackaged” loan finance can meet private sector criteria.\n“The lightbulb moment was realising there was $50bn in performing green loans in Latin America,” said Persaud, a former adviser to Barbados’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, who has championed climate finance. “Why not buy that to enable new projects to be created?”\nKey to the concept is that when the loans are bought up by the development banks, which pay a small premium to the current private sector creditors that own the loans, the originators of the renewable energy projects must agree to use the finance they gain access to in new projects.\nThis creates a “virtuous circle”, by which when the loans are bought up, developers – who already have expertise in setting up successful renewable energy schemes – seek new opportunities, which leads to further investment.\nIADB is working on launching the programme now, and is expected to send a request for proposals within the next few months, before Cop30. The initial portfolio of loans is likely to be about $500m to £1bn.\nSeveral private and public sector experts said Persaud’s ideas could have a big impact.\nMattia Romani, a senior partner at Systemiq, a consultancy that is working with Cop30 on climate finance, said: “It is a very powerful initiative, both pragmatic and innovative. Given the constraints we will inevitably face in the coming years, securitisation is one of the few realistic tools to reach [the sums needed].\n“This initiative is designed to unlock institutional capital by leveraging the balance sheets of domestic commercial banks – securitising their loans so that they can meet the fiduciary needs of institutional investors, and turning them into engines for transition finance. What’s new is the direct engagement with local banks – we are starting with a pilot in Latin America.”"

    "raw_text": "Leaders of African countries are likely to use the next UN climate summit in November to push for massive new investment in fossil fuels in Africa, according to documents seen by the Guardian.\nNew exploration for gas, and the exploitation of Africa’s vast reserves of oil, would make it close to impossible for the world to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nHowever, soaring gas prices have made the prospect of African supplies even more attractive, and developed countries, including EU members, have indicated they would support such developments in the current gas shortage.\nThe Guardian has seen a technical document prepared by the African Union, comprising most of Africa’s states, for the “second extraordinary session of the specialised technical committee on transport, transcontinental and interregional infrastructure and energy committee”, a meeting of energy ministers that took place by video conference from 14 to 16 June.\nThe five-page document, and accompanying 25-page explanation, indicates that many African countries favour a common position that would inform their negotiating stance at the Cop27 UN climate summit, scheduled for this November in Egypt, which would entail pushing for an expansion of fossil fuel production across the continent.\nThe document states: “In the short to medium term, fossil fuels, especially natural gas will have to play a crucial role in expanding modern energy access in addition to accelerating the uptake of renewables.”\nMember states of the African Union will meet again, in Addis Ababa, this week to confirm the stance to be taken. They are expected to argue that Africa must be allowed to benefit from its fossil fuel reserves, as rich countries already have done, and that developed countries by contrast must take the lead on sharp cuts to their emissions.\nHowever, environmental campaigners from across the continent fear that the exploitation of gas and oil in Africa would bust global climate targets, prevent the development of renewable energy in Africa, and instead of being used for the benefit of ordinary people, would enrich multinational corporations, investors and the elite in some countries.\nMohamed Adow, the director of the thinktank Power Shift Africa, said it would be a mistake for Africa to opt for fossil fuels instead of moving straight to renewable energy. “Africa is blessed with abundant renewable energy, in sun and wind. Africa should not be shackled to expensive fossil fuels for decades,” he said.\nLorraine Chiponda, the coordinator of the Africa Coal Network, said: “The prospect that African leaders are presenting and pushing for gas developments and investment is overwhelming and reckless given the climate impacts that threaten the lives of millions of people in Africa having seen worsening droughts and hunger, recurring floods and cyclones. Fossil fuel projects have neither solved energy poverty in Africa where 600 million people still live in energy poverty nor brought any socio-economic justice to African people.”\nThe International Energy Agency warned last year that no new fossil fuel developments could take place if the world was to stay within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels. Recent extreme weather, including heatwaves and wildfires in Europe and North America, has intensified fears that the climate crisis is progressing faster than had been anticipated.\nAfrican countries are also expected to be among the most damaged by the impacts of the climate crisis. Drought is already afflicting a large swathe of the Horn of Africa at present, and millions of people are “marching toward starvation”, the World Food Programme has warned.\nBut the soaring price of gas, driven by war in Ukraine and the recovery from the Covid pandemic, has spurred many countries to see a potential bonanza in the unexploited reserves remaining in Africa. Research by the Guardian earlier this year revealed scores of “carbon bombs” – fossil fuel reserves that if exploited could put the global climate targets well out of reach.\nFatima Ahouli, regional coordinator of Climate Action Network Arab World, said leaders seeking new fossil fuel exploitation were contributing to a new form of colonialism.\n“Calling for more and new exploitation of fossil fuels in Africa is driven by the same hungry countries who only see Africa as a goldmine,” she said.\nGas in Africa is set to become of the flashpoints of the Cop27 climate talks. The EU has indicated it would support the production of gas in Africa, as it urgently seeks new sources of gas following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent threats to gas exports from Russia.\nMary Robinson, the chair of the Elders group of former statespeople and high-ranking business leaders, has also weighed in on the issue, controversially telling the Guardian earlier this year that African countries must be allowed to use their gas, though she insists it must be for domestic use, for electricity and as a clean cooking fuel, rather than being exported to the EU.\nAbout 580 million people in Africa still lack access to electricity and modern energy.\nAdow said exploiting gas in Africa would merely lock countries into a high-carbon future. He called for rich countries to make funds and support available for poorer countries to move to renewable energy instead. “There is plenty of opportunity for renewable energy in Africa, but countries need help to construct the infrastructure.”\nThe Guardian has approached the African Union for comment."

    "raw_text": "Nearly 2,000 children under five are dying every day from air pollution, which has overtaken poor sanitation and a lack of clean water to become the second biggest health risk factor for young children around the world.\nMore than 8 million deaths, of children and adults, were caused by air pollution in 2021, according to a new study from the Health Effects Institute (HEI), as both outdoor and indoor pollution continue to take an increasing toll on health.\nDirty air is now the second biggest killer globally, overtaking tobacco use, and second only to high blood pressure, as a risk factor for death among the general population. Among children under five, air pollution is second only to malnutrition as a risk factor in mortality.\nThis year’s State of Global Air report, published by the HEI since 2017, and produced this year in partnership with Unicef, also shows that children in poor countries are suffering some of the worst impacts, with the death rate linked to air pollution in children under five 100 times higher in most of Africa than it is in high income countries.\nPallavi Pant, the lead author of the report and head of global health at HEI, pointed to the vast inequalities that the report has uncovered. “Far too much of the burden [is] borne by young children, older populations, and low and middle income countries,” she said.\nTiny particles called PM2.5 – meaning they are smaller than 2.5 micrometres in diameter – are to blame for more than 90% of global air pollution deaths, the report found. PM2.5 particles can enter the bloodstream and have been found to affect organs throughout the body. They have been found to be associated not only with lung disease but heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia and miscarriage.\nThe report showed how pervasive and damaging the prevalence of PM2.5 pollution has become, finding that the presence of elevated levels of the fine particles was now “the most consistent and accurate predictor of poor health outcomes” around the world.\nKitty van der Heijden, the deputy executive director of Unicef, said: “Our inaction is having profound effects on the next generation, with lifelong health and wellbeing impacts. The global urgency is undeniable. It is imperative that governments and businesses consider these estimates and locally available data and use it to inform meaningful, child-focused action to reduce air pollution and protect children’s health.”\nThe impacts of the climate crisis are also worsening air quality, according to the HEI. The report found that “as droughts become more severe and prolonged, and lands grow ever drier, wildfires ravage once-thriving forests and dust storms impact vast plains, filling the air with particles that linger for long periods of time.”\nHigher temperatures in summer can also worsen the impacts of airborne pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, which at elevated temperatures can turn more readily into ozone, an irritant gas when breathed in. Long-term exposure to ozone contributed to nearly half a million deaths in 2021, the report found.\nTackling air pollution could also have beneficial impacts on the climate. About half a million of the deaths of children in 2021 were linked to dirty air indoors, mainly the result of cooking with dirty fuels, including biomass, charcoal, paraffin and coal. Switching to cleaner fuels, such as solar cookstoves, could vastly reduce PM2.5 emissions, as well as emissions of carbon dioxide.\nAbout 2.3 billion people around the world lack access to clean cooking fuels. The International Energy Agency estimates that about $4bn a year is needed between now and 2030 to solve the problem in sub-Saharan Africa alone. It held a global summit last month that raised $2.2bn for projects to help move people across the continent to cleaner methods.\nFatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said the problem needed to be seen as a global priority for governments, with impacts on health, the climate and national economies, as well as gender equality, because women and girls are often given the task of finding firewood. “This is an issue that has been ignored for too long,” he said.\nThe State of Global Air report used data from the Global Burden of Disease study from 2021, covering more than 200 countries and territories around the world. Previous reports have found that nearly every person breathes unhealthy levels of air pollution each day, and that half a million babies were being killed each year by filthy air."

    "raw_text": "It’s a truly dreadful irony: for many of the 400 million people in sub-Saharan Africa who lack access to even a basic water supply, there is likely to be a significant reserve in aquifers sitting just a few metres below their feet.\nGroundwater – the water stored in small spaces and fractures in rocks – makes up nearly 99% of all of the unfrozen fresh water on the planet. Across the African continent, the volume of water stored underground is estimated to be 20 times the amount held in lakes and reservoirs.\nThe opportunity that groundwater presents for increasing access to water is widely recognised, with more than half of the global population already believed to be relying on it for drinking water.\nWhen you add the ability of solar energy to power the necessary infrastructure and the fact that groundwater supplies are much more resilient than surface water during drought, the potential for harnessing this water source to provide a clean and regular supply to communities in chronic need comes into focus.\nThe opportunity presented by solar technology for increasing groundwater pumping for drinking and irrigation will be discussed this week at the International Association of Hydrogeologists’ (IAH) World Groundwater Congress in Davos, Switzerland.\nMuch of the debate centres on how to best deploy this increasingly affordable solar technology to unlock groundwater potential; not just in terms of drinking water, but also in terms of irrigating crops – unleashing the ability to address both water and food insecurity without the need for fossil fuels.\nThe IAH congress comes at a time when the ability to map groundwater availability across the continent has never been greater. New understanding of African geology is helping local hydrogeologists predict which areas have the most potential for solar pumps and new, easy-to-use technology is being developed to help better assess the quality of groundwater.\nCommunities are helping determine the most sustainable management models for water supply, while donors and governments are taking increasing interest in the quality of rural supply chains.\nMomentum is building, and with it comes the chance to deliver meaningful, lifesaving change.\nThe fly in the ointment, however, is the complexity that comes from moving the hypothetical into the real world. There are two issues that will need to be at the centre of the discussions in Davos if we are to secure a sustainable route forward.\nFirst is the potential for overuse. With the ability to pump large volumes of water comes the possibility of overexploiting and depleting groundwater resources. This is a significant point of concern across parts of Asia, the Middle East and the US.\nSecond, we must not lose sight of the geological and environmental limitations of the technology to benefit fully from this opportunity. The ability to reach all parts of the region does not yet exist: about 30% of Africa’s rural population live on ancient rocks that may not be able to support the higher pumping rates demanded by large solar pumps.\nA recent study by the organisation I work for, the British Geological Survey, alongside partners from Paris-Saclay University, showed that geology was the key limiting factor to solar pumping, not the availability of sunshine.\nI will be calling for caution among those who see this solar-pumping revolution as a panacea – those who are focusing solely on the installation of large-scale systems that extract large volumes of groundwater that can then be piped directly to homes or to the farmers that need it.\nSuch programmes can provide a balance between investment and impact, and as such they are attracting increasing interest and financial backing. So they should, as when they work they will change the lives of many millions of people.\nHowever, alongside the big projects, there should continue to be investment in small-scale use of groundwater for rural water supply, and for technologies such as handpumps or low-yielding solar-powered pumps that are more appropriate for the geology.\nThese smaller pumps could improve access to water for rural communities while providing additional safeguards against overuse by matching pumping rates to the geology.\nWhere the geology is complex and yields from wells are low, small solar systems can pump throughout the day and store the water for domestic or productive use when it is actually needed.\nWe should measure our success in combining the power of solar technology with groundwater not in terms of people helped, but in those left behind. This approach would help focus our minds on a comprehensive solution – securing sustainable solutions that enhance access to clean drinking water for all.\nTechnological breakthroughs are exciting and progress is exhilarating. But it is essential that a focus on solar pumps does not distract attention from the most marginalised and vulnerable communities.\nI would invite everyone to see this “solar groundwater pumping revolution” in terms of equity. Through that lens, we have the chance to ensure that this precious resource is sustainably and fairly unlocked to all those who are still waiting for a safe and reliable water supply.\nProf Alan MacDonald is head of groundwater at the British Geological Survey and head of the IAH groundwater network for international development"

    "raw_text": "Developing countries need a fresh round of debt relief, to prevent money urgently needed for health and education being diverted to creditors, according to a major new report commissioned by the late Pope Francis.\nThe Jubilee report, produced by a panel of experts chaired by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, argues for debt restructuring, along the lines of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative (HIPC).\nStiglitz told the Guardian that many developing countries are facing a “perfect storm” as they had little choice but to ramp up borrowing through the Covid crisis and subsequently faced sharply higher interest rates as central banks battled to tackle inflation.\n“Now, because of Trump tariffs, there’s a global slowdown expected and that will give them even less revenue, and potentially it could lead to higher inflation and that again would lead to even higher interest rates. It’s one thing after another,” Stiglitz said.\nThe report warns that many governments, fearful of the consequences of default, “prioritise timely debt payments over essential development spending. This is not a path to sustainable development. Rather, it is a roadblock to development and leads to increasing inequality and discontent.”\nThe HIPC debt relief programme emerged out of a concerted campaign by civil society groups, including churches, calling for a “jubilee” for cash-starved developing countries.\nThe initiative saw more than $100bn of debt cancelled – including as a result of commitments made at the Gleneagles G8 summit, chaired by the UK.\nWith 2025 designated a jubilee year by the Catholic church, Pope Francis commissioned the new report, to explore how the current debt crisis could be tackled. He called last year for “an international mechanism for debt restructuring based on the solidarity and harmony of peoples.” The report will be presented to his successor, Leo XIV, at the Vatican on Friday.\nThe research underscores the gravity of the situation for many countries, warning: “The consequences are particularly acute in Africa, where debt distress is most severe. Approximately 57% of the continent’s population – 751 million people, including nearly 288 million living in extreme poverty – reside in countries that spend more on servicing external debt than on education or healthcare.”\nThe authors warn that the impact is likely to be rising poverty and malnutrition, the “erosion of hope” and “deepening social fractures”.\nThey also point out that the situation is more complex than in the early 2000s, when much of the debt was owed to governments, or other public sector bodies.\n“The international community has a moral obligation to advance a ‘HIPC II.’ However, the challenges of implementing such a comprehensive solution today are greater than those faced during the original HIPC initiative,” the report says.\nAs well as debt write-offs, the report argues for a series of technical and legal changes to the global financial system, to tackle the debt crisis and prevent it recurring again.\nThese include backing calls for legislation in the UK, where much sovereign debt is issued, that would force private sector creditors to bear their fair share of write-offs in any debt restructuring agreement. “The private guys shouldn’t get more than the public guys,” said Stiglitz.\nThe authors also argue for a “no bailout clause” that would stop rescue loans offered by the International Monetary Fund to hard-pressed governments being used to pay off private sector lenders.\nGovernments are due to discuss debt relief at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Seville at the end of this month.\nA draft outcome document was agreed this week, including a commitment to seek “an intergovernmental process at the United Nations, with a view to make recommendations for closing gaps in the debt architecture and exploring options to address debt sustainability”.\nThat was significantly weaker than language advocated by African governments, that would have promised “far reaching reform” of the global system and “a more comprehensive, fair and effective multilateral mechanism for preventing and resolving sovereign debt crises”.\nKeir Starmer has been urged by the directors of scores of UK charities and campaign groups to attend the summit in person and back plans for debt relief."

    "raw_text": "In the next four years, British entrepreneur Mansoor Hamayun expects to connect 36 million people to an electricity source, many for the first time. It is an ambition that would see his clean energy company, Bboxx, expand its reach tenfold across sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe London-headquartered company has grown from an idealistic startup with hopes of transforming the lives of African households to a company offering pay-as-you-go solar power, batteries, smartphones and electric motorbikes to about 3.6 million people across Africa in little more than a decade. Now, a $100m (£78m) investment from EnerTech, a Kuwait-based investor, is about to spur its fastest growth yet.\n“Bboxx will turbocharge the impact we have on communities across sub-Saharan Africa,” Hamayun says. “Our shared vision is to transform the lives and livelihoods of our customers by giving them access to clean and affordable energy, clean cooking, e-mobility and technology like smartphones, that genuinely unlock their potential, day by day.”\nBboxx was founded by Hamayun and two university friends – Christopher Baker-Brian and Laurent Van Houcke – to gain a foothold in the enormous untapped energy potential that the African market represents. It is one of a growing number of companies pioneering a new approach to energy supply: off-grid and pay-as-you-go.\nHamayun’s story began about 15 years ago with 60 households in Rwanda. Over the course of a summer, while studying at Imperial College London, he set up a charity that provided six villages with solar electricity for the first time. The project continues to generate power to this day.\nThe project began as an “academic challenge”, he says. At the time about 1.6 billion people globally were without access to reliable sources of electricity – and these numbers threatened to spiral as population growth outpaced progress on the world’s sustainable development goals.\nSince then, the number of people living without access to electricity across Asia’s developing economies has plunged, while Africa has remained largely in the dark. About 570 million people on the continent do not have access to electricity, and another 840 million are connected to an unreliable grid.\n“Africa is the biggest unserved consumer market on earth,” says Hamayun. Bboxx offers simple solar and battery systems which can provide light and power to homes that have no access to a stable electricity grid. The company also offers clean cookers, electric water pumps, smartphones and electric motorbikes.\nThe impact is often profound. Access to reliable electricity can provide the power to open small businesses, educate children and safeguard the ill or vulnerable. “It’s transformational,” Hamayun says.\n“Electricity is so fundamental to ensuring an acceptable quality of life. I met a customer in Kenya last year who was extremely proud that her daughter had just been accepted to a medical university. She said the ability to have lights continuously at home helped tremendously in educating her children. They worked so hard, but the fact that we contributed a little bit towards that outcome … well, it’s incredibly motivating for all of us.”\nA customer in Rwanda recently praised Bboxx for increasing the amount of milk his cow was able to produce. “And I couldn’t work out how we had influenced this man’s cow,” he laughs. “He explained that thanks to the electricity he was able to run a water pump for the first time; and more water for the cow means more milk. In hindsight, it all makes total sense.” The story has stayed with Hamayun as a reminder of the myriad, unexpected ways that electricity can alter the lives of those who access it for the first time.\nThe Bboxx business model hinges on Africa’s telecoms boom and the widespread adoption of “mobile money” banking, which has made pay-as-you-go an accessible option for millions of people who could not afford a longterm pay-monthly contract.\n“People might not be able to pay $30 a month for a service, but they can afford to pay $1 a day. Yet a lot of service-based offerings still call for monthly billing. It’s a very western way of thinking.”\nSwitching from kerosene lamps and stoves to solar power and clean cookers is often cheaper, too, says Hamayun. “People don’t realise it’s expensive to be poor in Africa. A lot of goods are more expensive there than in the UK. We’re offering a cheaper option on better terms.”\nHamayun says Bboxx’s rivalry with similar companies is not in the battle for potential customers, but in the area of recruitment. “Where competition is fierce is in finding capital and talent,” he says. “There is a limited pool of money, which is smaller than what the size of the market requires.”\nBboxx has the backing of Japanese utility giant Mitsubishi and France’s Engie, and has secured regional partnerships with major western energy companies including EDF to help increase their reach across the continent. For these major utilities Africa provides a testbed for a new, digital data-led energy system still in its infancy in the developed world. Already, the continent is “leapfrogging” the need for centralised fossil fuel power plants and costly grid systems by leaning on renewables and data, Hamayun says.\n“There really are no limits to the scale that you can grow in this market. Take Nigeria: it has a population of about 228 million people, but this is forecast to grow to 400 million by 2050. Already, its power grid is extremely unreliable, so the size of the challenge is enormous. But at the same time, it is a country with a young population that has the ability to change and adapt to new technology.\n“You have all of these factors at play at the same time, which makes Africa very exciting.”\nCV\nAge 35\nFamily Married with a “kid on the way”\nEducation Masters of engineering, electrical and electronic engineering from Imperial College London\nPay £300k + “other typical CEO stuff”\nBiggest career mistake “Not focusing on the culture of the business from Day Zero and maintaining it throughout”\nBest advice he has been given There is no shortcut to hard work\nOverused phrase Make the impossible, possible\nWhat he does to relax Socialising in all its forms.

    "raw_text": "The risk of neocolonial exploitation in the global rush for critical minerals must be addressed by the government as it formulates its official supply chain strategy, say civil society campaigners.\nThey have said the scrabble for access is being greenwashed as wealthier economies around the world attempt to line up a host of minerals that are essential to the manufacture of hi-tech products, including cobalt, lithium and nickel.\nWhile the importance of such minerals to the green transition is often touted, with many crucial to the manufacture of turbines, solar panels and other low carbon energy sources, campaigners point out that much of the demand comes from the arms and consumer tech industries.\n“To have a chance at success, the green transition cannot be built on the exploitation of poorer countries by unaccountable corporations,” said Cleodie Rickard, the policy manager at Global Justice Now.\n“That’s why the UK government must seize the opportunity to set out a new approach in its upcoming critical minerals strategy. That starts with delineating which minerals are really critical for what end, and prioritising those needed for public goods of a green future – not the likes of arms companies’ profits.”\nBy 2040, the world is expected to need four times as many critical minerals as it does today, and while the US deal with Ukraine for access to its mineral wealth has hit the headlines, deals have also been struck more quietly around the world, away from public attention.\nThe UK government has already signed non-binding agreements with Saudi Arabia, Australia, Kazakhstan and Zambia in an effort to corner their mineral resources, and is this year poised to publish a 10-year critical minerals strategy to support the “industries of tomorrow”.\nBut in a joint briefing released on Thursday, 17 organisations, including the Trade Justice Movement, Global Justice Now, Corporate Justice Coalition and Friends of the Earth say that without safeguards, the UK and other powerful nations risk perpetuating a system of neocolonial exploitation that “sacrifices justice for the sake of convenience”.\nThe increased levels of mining needed to extract minerals risks disrupting ecosystems and creating water scarcity, as well as workers’ rights abuses, violation of Indigenous rights and occupational safety and health issues.\nThe new strategy, they say, must clearly differentiate between minerals needed for the energy transition, and commit to limiting extraction and the principles of the circular economy. It must also ensure that bilateral agreements with producer countries respect core UN and International Labour Organization human rights and labour rights conventions, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the Paris agreement on climate change.\nTom Wills, the director of the Trade Justice Movement, said: “The UK’s approach to securing critical minerals must not repeat the mistakes of the past, where the drive for resource extraction left behind a trail of environmental degradation and human suffering.\n“The UK has a responsibility to lead a sustainable and fair global transition to clean energy which prioritises both environmental protection and human rights. We cannot afford to perpetuate a system that sacrifices justice for the sake of convenience.”\nThe Department for Business and Trade, which is responsible for the UK’s critical minerals strategy, has been contacted for comment."

    "raw_text": "The financing of transition mineral mining is driving widespread environmental destruction and human rights abuses, according to a report.\nBanks and investors have ploughed hundreds of billions of dollars into companies mining for minerals for the manufacture of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, energy grids and electric vehicles in the past decade, according to the research.\nBut the institutions funding this extraction have “dangerously weak” environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies relating to mineral mining, the report says, with most lacking any meaningful safeguards for communities and ecosystems.\n“Without urgent reform, finance will continue to reinforce an extractive, high-risk model that undermines both climate and nature goals, and tramples human rights,” according to the report.\nMaurício Angelo, the executive director of Mining Observatory, said: “Mining is one of the main causes of the climate crisis and now presents itself as a central part of the solution to the problem in the energy transition without changing its exploration model and value chain worldwide. This is a glaring contradiction that can no longer be ignored by decision-makers.”\nThe research has been undertaken by the Forests & Finance coalition, an initiative that researches who is funding the companies involved in a range of industries affecting tropical forests and the communities that rely on them in south-east Asia, central and west Africa, and parts of South America.\nAccording to the report, leading banks poured $493bn (£369bn) in loans and underwriting into transition mineral mining companies between 2016 and 2024, while investors held $289bn (£216bn) in bonds and shares.\nBut the ESG policies held across 30 top institutions devoting the most in financing to projects were weak, leading to a situation where nearly 70% of transition mineral mines overlap with Indigenous or peasant lands, and 71% were located in high-biodiversity regions already under climate and social stress.\nDrawing on case studies from Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, the report links transition mineral mining to deforestation, pollution, Indigenous rights violations, unsafe labour practices, new coal plants, fatal and catastrophic collapses of tailings dams, and ecosystem destruction.\nWith four-fifths of the investments into miners coming from institutions in the US, Australia, the UK, Japan and Brazil, the report calls on governments to “embed justice and environmental protection into financial regulation”, enforce corporate transparency and accountability, and to strengthen mandatory due diligence on issues of environment and human rights.\nIt also calls on financial institutions to reform their approach to financing miners, specifically that they should embed respect for human rights and international law into their policies, and exclude companies linked to deforestation and rights abuses.\n“This should be a wake-up call for every policymaker, banker and investor: you cannot build a just energy future by trampling rights, displacing communities and torching biodiversity,” said Stephanie Dowlen, a forest campaigner with Rainforest Action Network, a member of the Forests & Finance coalition. “A just transition needs finance that no longer rewards bad behaviour and corporate impunity."

    "raw_text": "Africa must embrace renewable energy, and forgo exploration of its potentially lucrative gas deposits to stave off climate disaster and bring access to clean energy to the hundreds of millions who lack it, leading experts on the continent have said.\nTheir call came as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that exploring for gas and oil anywhere in the world would be “delusional”.\nSeveral African leaders are considering pushing for new investment in exploration as gas prices around the world soar. Some European countries are also eager to provide such investment to replace supplies from Russia.\nLast week, Mary Robinson, a former president of Ireland, UN commissioner for human rights and UN climate envoy, stoked controversy when she backed an expansion, saying African countries should exploit their gas reserves.\nShe said the gas should be used within the continent for clean cooking and power generation for the 600 million people who lacked access to power and the 900 million who were cooking on biomass or dirty oil, rather than exported for profit.\nMohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank and 2020 winner of the Climate Breakthrough prize, said Robinson was wrong.\n“For Africans to achieve the lives of dignity that energy access should bring, we cannot rely on the failed system of the last 200 years. We must leapfrog our thinking and make the investment into distributed renewable energy systems that won’t poison our rivers, pollute our air, choke our lungs and profit only a few,” he told the Guardian.\nMaking a distinction between voices from the west and those from Africa, he said: “Climate justice champions who actually live in Africa are very clear that we want access to energy for everyone – but equally we do not want to lock in climate catastrophe for everyone.”\nHe was joined by Nnimmo Bassey, the director of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation in Nigeria. “Decades of oil and gas extraction on the continent has fed foreign markets and only muddied the water, built violence, and left the people in the cold and in the dark,” he said, highlighting the experience of Nigeria, the Niger Delta and Mozambique, characterised by pollution and profiteering by a few while local people remained impoverished.\nHe accused political leaders of ignoring these concerns: “Sadly, African politicians acting as middlemen to transnational corporations are happy to parrot this song despite local resistance and the realities of ecocide in the fossil fuel fields.”\nOmar Elmawi, a coordinator at the StopEACOP campaign in east Africa, said: “Decades after exploiting fossil fuels in Africa, we have yet to improve energy poverty and countries have continued to drown themselves in unsustainable loans taken because of the promise of fossil fuel revenues.\n“Corporations registered in the global north have continued to benefit from these dirty fossil fuels in Africa and all we are left with are the impacts on our people, nature and the climate.”\nThe issue of gas in Africa is likely to prove a flashpoint at the Cop27 UN climate summit this November in Egypt. Robinson’s views, first expressed in an interview with the Guardian, sparked a row at UN climate talks in Bonn, where countries have held meetings over the past fortnight in preparatory negotiations for Cop27.\nSeveral African countries are thought to want to use Cop27 to argue for the continent to be allowed to exploit its gas, taking advantage of the fossil fuel bonanza that has followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Egypt is sympathetic, with the finance minister, Mohamed Maait, telling an audience in the City of London recently that poor countries must not be “punished”.\nHowever, Guterres made clear in a speech on Tuesday morning at the Austrian World Summit in Vienna that no new fossil fuels should receive investment.\nHe said: “New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production infrastructure is delusional. It will only further feed the scourge of war, pollution and climate catastrophe. The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a liveable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels, especially coal, and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition.”\nHe did not refer to Africa specifically but indicated the continent was included, by adding: “Renewables are the peace plan of the 21st century. Cheaper, more reliable and fairer energy options are already available in the shape of wind and solar. This is true for all regions.”\nHe called for a tripling of investment in renewables, the removal of red tape that blocked wind and solar projects and for more of the underlying technology to be made available for use in poor countries through the sharing of intellectual property known as technology transfer."

    "raw_text": "It has long been said that no one knows with any certainty the population of Lagos, Nigeria. When I spent time there a decade ago, the United Nations conservatively put the number at 11.5 million, but other estimates ranged as high as 18 million. The one thing everyone agreed was that Lagos was growing very fast. The population was already 40 times bigger than it had been in 1960, when Nigeria gained independence. One local demographer told me that 5,000 people were migrating to Lagos every day, mostly from the Nigerian countryside. Since then, the city has continued to swell. By 2035, the UN projects that Lagos will be home to 24.5 million people.\nWhat is happening in Lagos is happening across the continent. Today, Africa has 1.4 billion people. By the middle of the century, experts such as Edward Paice, author of Youthquake: Why Africa’s Demography Should Matter to the World, believe that this number will have almost doubled. By the end of this century, the UN projects that Africa, which had less than one-tenth of the world’s population in 1950, will be home to 3.9 billion people, or 40% of humanity.\nThese are staggering numbers, but they do not tell the full story. We need to zoom in closer. It is in cities where most of this astounding demographic growth will occur. Once we begin to think along these lines, what is at stake becomes even clearer. Much western commentary on Africa’s population growth has been alarmist and somewhat parochial, focusing on what this means for migration to Europe. The question of how African nations manage the fastest urbanisation in human history will certainly affect how many millions of its people seek to stay or leave. A recent continental survey by a South African foundation, for example, found that 73% of young Nigerians expressed an interest in emigrating within the next three years. But given its scale, this is a story with far larger implications than population movements alone, shaping everything from global economic prosperity to the future of the African nation state and the prospects for limiting climate crisis.\nThere is one place above all that should be seen as the centre of this urban transformation. It is a stretch of coastal west Africa that begins in the west with Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast, and extends 600 miles east – passing through the countries of Ghana, Togo and Benin – before finally arriving at Lagos. Recently, this has come to be seen by many experts as the world’s most rapidly urbanising region, a “megalopolis” in the making – that is, a large and densely clustered group of metropolitan centres. When its population surpassed 10 million people in the 1950s, the New York metropolitan area became the anchor of one of the first urban zones to be described this way – a region of almost continuous dense habitation that stretches 400 miles from Washington DC to Boston. Other regions, such as Japan’s Tokyo-Osaka corridor, soon gained the same distinction, and were later joined by other gigantic clusters in India, China and Europe.\nBut the Abidjan-Lagos stretch now stands to become the granddaddy of them all. In just over a decade from now, its major cities will contain 40 million people. Abidjan, with 8.3 million people, will be almost as large as New York City is today. The story of the region’s small cities is equally dramatic. They are either becoming major urban centres in their own right, or – as with places like Oyo in Nigeria, Takoradi in Ghana, and Bingerville in Ivory Coast – they are gradually being absorbed by bigger cities. Meanwhile, newborn cities are popping into existence in settings that were all but barren a generation ago. When one includes these sorts of places, the projected population for this coastal zone will reach 51 million people by 2035, roughly as many people as the north-eastern corridor of the US counted when it first came to be considered a megalopolis.\nBut unlike that American super-region, whose population long ago plateaued, this part of west Africa will keep growing. By 2100, the Lagos-Abidjan stretch is projected to be the largest zone of continuous, dense habitation on earth, with something in the order of half a billion people.\n“I have worked in China and in India, and that is where most of the attention on cities has been until fairly recently, but Africa is unquestionably the continent that will drive the future of urbanisation. And it is that strip along the coast of west Africa where the biggest changes are coming,” said Daniel Hoornweg, a scholar of urbanisation at Ontario Tech University. “If it can develop efficiently, the region will become more than the sum of its parts – and the parts themselves are quite big. But if it develops badly, a tremendous amount of economic potential will be lost, and in the worst of cases, all hell could break loose.”\nThe first time I travelled along this stretch of coast was in the late 1970s, on a long road trip to Nigeria from Ivory Coast, where my family then lived. My father, who ran a 20-country healthcare training programme for the World Health Organization, had a meeting to attend in Lagos, and he decided to invite my brothers and me along for the ride. At the time I was a first-year college student in the US, but it was the summer holidays, and I was excited to jump aboard a clattering old-school grey Land Rover for the trip.\nHe followed a route traced out on a well-worn, foldable Michelin map. It did not take long to discover that many of the routes marked on the map in red – supposedly signifying national or international highways – were little more than two-lane asphalt roads, some of which had long ago been chewed to oblivion by heavy trucking traffic, or eroded by years of seasonal rains. The secondary or tertiary roads, traced more faintly in yellow and white, signalled far greater challenges: jarring dirt paths that were more like trails than highways. These would leave our bodies aching and caked with dust. For long stretches, the west African countryside was so empty that we had to carry our own fuel in jerry cans.\nOne unfortunate artefact of this region’s imperial history is that, while the British and French built roads and railways to transport agricultural commodities and minerals from the hinterlands of their colonies to modern ports – where they could be shipped home for great profit – in their intense imperial rivalry, they did little to connect their respective possessions. But by 1992, when I took another long drive along this coast, a stretch of highway had been built on either side of the frontier between Ivory Coast and Ghana circumventing a coastal lagoon, and relegating the old picturesque but chancy border-crossing ferry to quaint memory. Back then, few could have imagined the full scope of the changes coming to this stretch of coast – though, in retrospect, some of the signs were already clear.\nAs late as 1980, Lagos had still seemed like a series of modest towns barely stitched together by its highways and bridges. By the early 90s, though, it had exploded in size, and was already choking on itself. It had become notorious for some of the world’s worst traffic jams, known locally as go-slows. Abidjan, the region’s second-largest city, had also begun to morph. Its suburbs were expanding, thrusting toward the border with Ghana to the east. The other national and economic capitals of this region – Accra in Ghana, Lomé in Togo and Cotonou in Benin – were likewise starting to mushroom.\nBut it was on more recent trips, in the 2010s, that I saw the urban revolution transforming west Africa coming into full view. By then, Ivory Coast had laid down a true highway all the way from Abidjan to its border with Ghana. Abidjan had gobbled up early colonial capitals like Bingerville and the postcard-pretty but long-stagnant beach town of Grand-Bassam, turning them into dormitory communities. The roadside scenery during a drive from border to border along the Ghanaian coast bore no resemblance to the lightly peopled landscapes of earlier decades. Towns and cities were strung together one after another along nearly the entire route. For long stretches, one scarcely ever left an urban environment.\nAs always in this region, Lagos is where the most dramatic changes are visible. As it swells, the city is shooting thick urban tendrils west toward the border with Benin – the slender, francophone nation of 12 million people next door – rendering much of that country’s economy a satellite not so much of Nigeria, but of Lagos itself. (If Lagos state were an independent country, its economy would rank as the fourth-biggest in Africa.)\nLed by Lagos, as coastal west Africa’s urbanisation gathers pace, and populations and regional commerce begin to surge across old imperial borders, the lives of tens of millions of people along the coastal corridor are changing in ways that neither colonial designs nor six decades of independent government seem to have remotely anticipated.\nEarlier this year, I returned to the coast, this time not for one long road trip, but for a series of shorter forays by car in Ghana, Togo and Benin. Everywhere I went, the speed and scale of the historic transformations under way were evident. In Ghana, I visited a place I had encountered on previous trips, Takoradi, and its conjoined twin, the railroad town of Sekondi. In 1980, the two towns together counted 197,000 people. This year, their population surpassed a threshold that only 14 American cities have ever reached: 1 million people, a more than five-fold increase in little more than a generation.\nOn the July morning I returned to Takoradi, it was the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha, or Tabaski, and the narrow downtown streets were packed with young celebrants from the local Muslim minority, all dressed colourfully in flowing laced robes. When the centre of Takoradi was built, more than a century ago, the city was Ghana’s lone port. It was here that Kwame Nkrumah famously returned by ship from England in 1947, emerging from obscurity to lead his country, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, to independence 10 years later. In their fading pastel and dreary grey tones, the verandaed buildings of the old downtown looked like the set of a period drama. Just beyond here, though, the antiquated scene gave way to an enormous construction site, where a highway flyover was rising above dusty streets. Once complete, it will allow traffic to bypass the old, outgrown centre in favour of the much larger modern periphery, where most of the city’s people now live.\nAt Takoradi’s western edge, I stopped at a new shopping mall where, on the shelves of a busy supermarket, I found South African wines, Swiss chocolates, cellophane packs of the same brand of fresh blueberries I eat every day in New York, and – an even more surefire sign of disposable income – expensive canned dog food. There were also Portuguese and Chinese restaurants, a beauty salon, mobile phone shops and a bridal gown dealer doing brisk business.\nIt is not immediately obvious where the income necessary to sustain this kind of commercial strip comes from. Some surely derives from work in the offshore oil business based nearby, some from a recently expanded regional port, some from a combination of old-line cocoa farming and new jobs in tech. And this points to the reality of what makes this megaregion so distinctive from earlier ones. Since at least the 18th century, as the writings of Hegel and Hume show, Africa has been widely regarded in the west as if it existed outside the flow of history – scarcely a participant in the global present, and even less relevant to the future. This has never been true, but those who cling on to such misapprehensions would do well to visit this stretch of coastline. In Lagos, Accra, Abidjan, or even in much smaller places like Takoradi, meanwhile, globalised enclaves with strong links to the rich world jostle with expanses of ragged urbanity, half hopefully striving, half congealed in poverty.\nOn another morning, I drove from the heart of Ghana’s capital, Accra, to the city of Kasoa, less than 20 miles away. Kasoa is sometimes touted as one of the fastest-growing conurbations on the continent. When I made my first trips along this coast in the 70s, it was little more than a shambling collection of rural roadside traders’ stalls. In 1984, Kasoa had 3,000 people. Scarcely a decade ago, its population was just shy of 70,000. Now it is home to roughly half a million people, equal to Edinburgh or Tucson.\nThe view from an overpass above Kasoa on the coastal highway is a reminder that cities throughout Africa have tended to sprawl outwards, rather than upward. There is little high-rise housing here, and few tall buildings of any kind. From up high, Kasoa has a rough-hewn, unfinished look. The newborn city lurches outward from the highway junction in all directions, its roads jammed with traffic. For many experts, this is a problematic feature of much of west Africa’s urbanisation: it is almost entirely unplanned.\nKasoa’s streets are frenzied with jumbles of wooden stalls and incessant trading of all kinds. In the dusty byways beyond the highway, young people were everywhere: hawking sachets of cold water, running after cars to sell mobile phone credits and cheap plastic toys, crying out the prices of sweet, puffy bread or plantain chips from beneath beach umbrellas on street corners.\nMost noticeable of all were the schoolchildren walking the streets in their uniforms and backpacks. By 2050, about 40% of all the people under 18 in the world will be African, a proportion that will reach half by century’s end. On the streets of Kasoa, statistics like these come to life. Everywhere there were billboards for daycare centres, kindergartens and “international schools”. The only real competition for school ads came from church ads, which offer promises of success in this world as much as in the next.\nMost of the people who fill the streets of places like Kasoa are recent arrivals from the countryside, and live in ramshackle cinderblock dwellings. Julius Ackatiah, a 55-year-old, recently set himself up in business here after many years in Italy, where he had already realised the African dream of emigration, legally acquiring a new nationality in a rich European country. I met him as he peered out from the unfussy sidestreet storefront where he sells secondhand housewares he has shipped from Italy.\nWhy had he chosen Kasoa, I asked him? Accra has recently become overbuilt and too expensive, Ackatiah said, but Kasoa was on the rise. “There are lots of people here, and they are trying to set up new homes for themselves and make new lives in this town. That makes for good business.” As Ackatiah spoke on the stairs of his shop, he was engulfed by his used-goods stock in trade: cheap plastic chairs, living room couches and tables, computer monitors and household appliances, small and large, from refrigerators and microwaves to laundry irons.\nOne of the biggest challenges for Africa’s emerging megaregions remains its weak transport networks. In 2018, more than 40 nations agreed to create the African Continental Free Trade Area, an arrangement that economists say could boost African GDP by $450bn by 2035, mostly thanks to increased intra-African commerce. Since then, another 10 countries have joined, including Nigeria, making for a truly continent-wide agreement. “At its crux, outside the World Trade Organization, it is the biggest region of free trade in the world,” said Astrid Haas, a Ugandan independent economist based in Kampala. “What it is intended to do is unlock the benefits on the continental scale for African countries to be able to trade with each other; to eliminate both tariff and non-tariff barriers.”\nBut realising its full potential will require much more intense cooperation between neighbours, and especially on improving physical infrastructure. Algiers and Cairo remain the only African cities with underground commuter lines. (In recent years, inspired citizen designers have carefully sketched out potential subway networks for cities such as Kigali and Port Harcourt, but these remain hopeful ideas for now.) Abidjan and Lagos are building surface light urban rail systems, but both are small-scale and behind schedule. Meanwhile, the lack of decent roads continues to hold this region back. The four-lane highway between Accra and Kasoa aside, almost the entire 600-mile stretch of coast consists of an undivided two-lane road that passes slowly through small towns and villages. Drivers sometimes find themselves having to dodge daring pedestrians and errant animals.\nThen there are the predatory police and soldiers who stop drivers in order to extort money under the pretext of traffic safety checks or the fight against crime. Last summer, on the outskirts of Takoradi, I was waved down by a portly, peanut-chewing police officer who asked, as if it was the most normal thing in the world: “What have you brought for me?” West African travellers face holdups like this, smiling or not, on a daily basis. On a trip in Ghana in the 90s, when I travelled 340 miles from the northern town of Bolgatanga to the central city of Kumasi, I counted 72 roadblocks. If anything, international borders in the region have long been even worse hotspots for this kind of predation.\nYet there is some reason for optimism. In May, the African Development Bank announced it had raised $15.6bn to fund the construction of a new coastal highway from Lagos to Abidjan. “We are talking about something like the road between Baltimore and New York – a toll road,” said Lydie Ehouman, a transportation economist at the bank, who told me the target for completion of the highway, which will be four to six lanes wide throughout, is 2026. “It will be free-flowing, with a chip in your licence plate so you don’t need to stop at toll gates. It will be a modern highway.” Economists at the African Development Bank argue that the West African Highway, as the new road will be called, will increase cross-border trade among the participating countries by 36%.\n“If people are confident in the availability of reliable, rapid transportation, other things will begin to change dramatically, too,” said Hoornweg, the Ontario Tech professor. “Property values will rise sharply along the major transportation axes, and that will encourage people to build upward, with highrises, rather than building out with more and more sprawl. The cities will also become much more efficient and environmentally friendly, and that makes their development more sustainable.”\nOn the ground today, a vision like this isn’t so easily conjured. It’s true that in Lagos a collection of impressive modern highrises is slowly taking shape. And in downtown Accra, a dazzling new real estate scheme – high-end apartment towers, office buildings, fancy shopping plazas, luxury hotels – is planned for the waterfront. But such projects are catering to the needs of the already wealthy, and not to the growing millions of people in the region who will soon urgently need housing. Here, the contrast with China, where huge clusters of residential high-rises ring every large city, could not be more striking. Rather than avatars of the future, in fact, the easiest thing to conclude from projects like these is that the region’s governments are setting their sights far too low to address the sweeping demographic and social changes on their way. This may even be true about the coastal highway system.\n“The best thing that could happen to west Africa would be if someone could convince these countries to seriously consider the experience of Asia,” said Alain Bertaud, a senior fellow at the Marron Institute at New York University. As a former World Bank official who specialises in urbanisation, Bertaud advised China about developing one of the world’s most successful megaregions, in the Pearl River delta. “Density itself does not create prosperity,” Bertaud told me. “You will have to have lots more transportation, including new rail lines, new roads that link the coastal highway to the hinterlands and to small cities, where the cheaper land is.” He pointed out that this requires a lot of building across national borders, which is not easy in any part of the world. “In India, we have seen that even building a corridor that crosses several states within the same country is difficult. In Africa they will need much better coordination.”\nHaas, the Ugandan economist, agreed. “Africa faces a need for $20-25 billion annually in infrastructure investment, plus $20bn more each year for housing. Trying to convey the scale here is very hard. We are talking about ballooning numbers, and people need to be shocked into action.”\nToward the end of my trip, I took a three-hour drive from Accra to the border with Togo. As we drove, Accra soon gave way to a grimy industrial zone that stretched for miles. From here all the way to the border, about 120 miles, the landscape was filled with peri-urban sprawl, its most distinctive feature being the ubiquitous roadside schools where children played sports or milled about.\nAt the border, as soon as I climbed out of my car I was surrounded by touts eager to sell me taxi rides, exchange currency for me or help expedite my visa and vaccination checks. I proceeded alone, expecting complications, but was pleasantly surprised at how straightforward the procedures were on both sides of the border. My first question to the driver I hired on the Togolese side was how far it was to the capital, Lomé. He laughed. “You’re already in Lomé,” he said. “In 15 minutes, you will be at your hotel.”\nThe next day, a Sunday, I drove 30 minutes east from Lomé to a small town with Royce Wells, a 30-year-old American IT professional who wanted to inspect the progress on a beachside house he is building. Togo is an unusually narrow country – wedged between Ghana and Benin, it runs about 430 miles north to south, but has only 31 miles of coastline. For this reason, local elites and foreign investors alike have long dreamed of building it into a kind of entrepot trading state that profits from various kinds of arbitrage, from sharp currency fluctuations in Nigeria and Ghana to varying levels of corruption and political risk among its neighbours.\nTogo maintains a democratic facade through regular elections, but has been tightly controlled by one family since 1963. In contrast to Nigeria, though, the electricity works, the internet is fast, and everyday life is not plagued by insecurity. With its commercial future in mind, Togo has built a port with capacity much larger than its domestic needs, and also produces cement, steel and other industrial and consumer goods for its larger neighbours. On this basis, Wells sees the country as a good bet, and hopes to make money building hotels there. “The places that learn how to create the right tax incentives and legal protections [for investors] will basically be able to arbitrage on Lagos and its dysfunction,” he told me.\nOthers are much more sceptical that this vision will ever be realised. After all, it relies on canny decision-making at the top of government. Bright Simons, a prominent Ghanaian political analyst and entrepreneur, called this five-nation megaregion “one of the most administratively broken landscapes on the planet”. Its governments are “unbelievably un-strategic”, he said. “I am always puzzled by the enthusiasm of elites for creating chambers of commerce with Mexico, or some other distant country, rather than with their own neighbours.”\nHere, the needs of west Africa’s booming population collide with the stubborn realities of the nation state, and specifically with contrasting colonial histories. Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo are former French colonies, and Nigeria and Ghana were colonised by Britain. This has left different official languages in place, whether English or French, as well as a currency in the French-speaking states, the CFA franc, that is a relic of colonisation – it was once tied to the French franc and is now attached to the euro. Perhaps the most important imperial legacy, though, is the insular national elites who, because of colonial history and the near-checkerboard way the countries alternate between English and French, pay scarce heed to each other. A Nigerian I met in Accra, for example, told me: “It wasn’t until I started spending time in Ghana recently that I realised Ghana isn’t our neighbour. Benin sits next to us, followed by Togo.”\nCotonou, the economic capital of Benin (separate from but very close to its national capital, Porto-Novo), lies 20 miles from the border of Nigeria, and 76 miles from Lagos, but there is no immediate sense of the behemoth next door. The city of 700,000 (on its way to 5 million by 2100) clusters around a small and tidy administrative centre, complete with a modernist presidential palace built largely in glass, whose large size belies the diminutive nature of Benin itself, the corridor’s second-smallest state. With its low-rise buildings and heavy scooter traffic, much of Cotonou feels scarcely different from a big town or village. Whether Benin likes it or not, Lagos’s accelerating expansion seems destined to one day swamp this place.\nWhen I asked a longtime acquaintance, a successful businessman from Benin, whether people in his country, including its leaders, sustain close relations with Nigeria, the answer was no. “The elite here still flatters itself with talk about being the Latin Quarter of the region, due to our French chauvinism,” he said, referring to the pre-independence era when France made Benin a regional centre of colonial education. “Our leaders are very poor at thinking ahead … If you tell the president he has nice shoes, he’ll be swimming in happiness. With Nigeria next door, what we should have done long ago is make English a compulsory second language in school, but no one has ever thought of that.”\nThis kind of pessimism, built upon a scornful assessment of governance at the national level in west Africa, is widespread. “We are going to need to have a functioning Ghanaian state, functioning states in Benin and Togo, and at least a minimally functional Nigerian government all at the same time in order to make this hugely urbanised future livable,” said E Gyimah-Boadi, the 70-year-old co-founder and former CEO of the Ghana Center for Democratic Development, a thinktank.\n“Part of me wants to believe that the youth of west Africa can be their own saviours, and that it is not because of the failures of my generation that they are necessarily doomed. The nation state has been a huge curse. It worked very well for some of us, but we have left very little behind for the young. Basically, we have cheated them.”\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

    "raw_text": "South Korea’s vital statistics\nOn a cool early morning on South Korea’s east coast, Eunbin Kang pointed to a monument to a vanishing era.\nThe 2.1GW Samcheok Blue power plant which came online in South Korea in January looms out of the headlands above a beach made internationally famous by a K-pop album shoot. It is expected to emit 13m tonnes of CO2 annually, while its lifespan could stretch beyond 2050, the year by which the country has pledged to reach carbon neutrality. The country was building coal-fired power plants, said Kang, an activist who heads the Youth Climate Emergency Action group and relocated to this city to oppose the facility, “even as the climate emergency demands an immediate halt to fossil fuel expansion”.\nBut Samcheok is not an outlier. It is a symbol of the stark climate contradiction at the heart of the world’s 12th largest economy, celebrated for its technological prowess in semiconductors and electric vehicle batteries, yet among the top ten worst global climate performers.\nDespite South Korea’s impressive climate pledges to reach net zero by 2050 with a 40% reduction in emissions from 2018 levels by 2030, fossil fuels still dominate its energy mix: 60% of electricity comes from coal and gas, while renewables make up just 9%, a quarter of the OECD average of 34%.\nMonopoly strangling transition\nAt the heart of South Korea’s climate failure is an energy model based on a state monopoly and central planning. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco), the state-owned energy company, controls transmission, distribution and retail, while its subsidiaries dominate generation, creating structural challenges for competitors. These include Korea South-East Power, Korea Western Power and four other generation subsidiaries that together operate the vast majority of the country’s coal, gas and nuclear power plants.\nMeanwhile, renewable energy developers face an obstacle course of regulatory barriers. Until recently, windfarm developers had to obtain 28 different permits from multiple ministries in a bureaucratic maze which created years of delays and significantly increased project costs, making many otherwise viable developments financially unfeasible. Progress was made in early 2025 with the passage of a long-awaited bill aimed at streamlining approvals, although the law won’t take effect until 2026.\nGrid connection remains another hurdle. While electricity demand has grown by 98% over the past two decades, the transmission network has expanded by just 26%, but attempts to expand the grid have led to bitter local conflicts.\nIn Miryang, South Gyeongsang province, the government tried to compel residents to sell up to clear space for transmission towers and people faced violent crackdowns during a six-year standoff. Currently, a dozen such projects are stalled in the country.\nIn February 2025, the National Assembly passed a Power Grid Special Act aimed at expanding transmission. But civic groups warn the law reinforces the country’s decades-old top-down model of infrastructure development, removing what few safeguards remained around public consultation and environmental review.\n“We fully acknowledge that renewable energy transition requires transmission lines,” says Kim Jeong-jin from Friends of the Earth in Dangjin, where one project faced more than 10 years of delays due to local opposition. “But the repeated conflicts arise because the electricity is not even for local use, yet it causes damage to our region without any regard for our voices.”\nThe country’s energy strategy is guided by the Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, a 15-year forecast revised every two years. But the framework, which dates back to the 1960s, still prioritises centralised, large-scale power generation – a model built for coal and nuclear, and fundamentally incompatible with today’s decentralised, flexible renewable technologies.\nPolitical volatility worsens the problem. Each five-year presidential term brings a policy reversal. For instance, in 2017, President Moon Jae-in announced a nuclear phase-out; his successor, the now disgraced ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, reversed course five years later. This whiplash undermines any long-term planning for renewables – a problem faced by democracies around the world.\nThe consequences are stark. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent fossil fuel prices soaring, Kepco incurred enormous losses. In 2022 alone, South Korea faced an extra 22tn won (£11.9 bn) in LNG power costs. Yet the government kept electricity prices artificially low, a political choice that pushed Kepco’s debt to a staggering 205tn won (£111bn) by 2024.\nDespite this crisis, meaningful reform remains elusive. This entrenched monopoly system has effectively blocked the clean energy transition, with independent renewable producers struggling to gain meaningful access to a market dominated by fossil fuel interests.\nCarbon-intensive by design\nMore broadly, South Korea’s postwar rise relied on energy-intensive industries: steel, petrochemicals, shipbuilding and semiconductors.\n“This structural dependency on heavy and chemical industries makes the energy transition extraordinarily difficult,” says Park Sangin, a professor of economics at Seoul National University. “These industries are deeply embedded in the country’s economic fabric and require vast amounts of stable, cheap electricity.”\nPowerful chaebols, or family-controlled conglomerates like Posco, Samsung and Hyundai, exert outsized influence on national policy. Their operations are supported by an electricity market designed for industrial stability, not climate mitigation.\nAnd the problem isn’t just domestic; South Korea also finances and provides the infrastructure for fossil fuels globally. South Korean shipbuilders dominate the global market for LNG carriers. Public financial institutions also bankroll overseas fossil fuel projects.\nOne that was recently approved, the Coral Norte gas project in Mozambique, is projected to emit 489m tonnes of CO2 across its lifecycle. At the same time, South Korea has emerged as one of the world’s top importers of Russian fossil fuels, even as other nations cut ties.\n“This financing directly contradicts [South] Korea’s climate targets and makes a mockery of the Paris Agreement,” says Dongjae Oh, the head of the gas team at Solutions for Our Climate (SFOC). “It exposes the country’s hypocrisy – adopting climate targets at home while funding climate destruction abroad.”\nEven climate-friendly institutions continue backing fossil fuels. The National Pension Service (NPS), one of the world’s largest pension funds, remains a major investor in coal and gas projects, despite a 2021 “coal-free” declaration. Three and a half years after this announcement, NPS only finalised its coal divestment strategy in December 2024, with a timeline that will delay implementation for domestic assets until 2030.\nMeanwhile, South Korea’s market-based climate policies have failed to drive meaningful change. The emissions trading scheme (K-ETS) was supposed to put a price on carbon when it launched in 2015.\nBut the system, which hands out free allowances to the largest companies, has instead created perverse incentives, according to campaign group Plan 1.5. The group carried out an analysis and found that South Korea’s 10 largest polluters have made over 475bn won (£258m) from selling unused carbon credits between 2015 and 2022. The system that was meant to make polluters pay has instead rewarded them.\nNext generation fights back\nThere is growing awareness of a climate crisis as the country begins to experience increasingly severe weather. In 2023 46 people died in floods that displaced thousands. More recently, torrential rains have again caused at least 26 deaths, followed by a record-breaking heatwave.\nIn March this year devastating wildfires swept across more than 48,000 hectares (118,610 acres) – roughly 80% of the area of Seoul – killing 31 people and destroying thousands of homes. The country’s disaster chief described the situation as “a climate crisis unlike anything we’ve experienced before”.\nThe prime minister, Kim Min-seok, has described the climate crisis as “the new normal”.\nNow a new generation of South Koreans is challenging the status quo through legal action. In February, a group of children gathered outside Posco’s office in Seoul. Among them was 11-year-old Yoohyun Kim, the youngest plaintiff in a groundbreaking lawsuit against Posco.\nThe case aims to block the company’s plan to reline an old coal-fired blast furnace, a move that would extend its life by 15 years and emit an estimated 137m tonnes of CO2.\n“I came here during my precious winter break, my last as an elementary school student, because I want to protect all four seasons,” Yoohyun told supporters. “Spring and autumn are disappearing with climate change – and with them, the chance for children like me to play freely outside.”\nThe lawsuit is the first of its kind globally to target traditional blast furnace production. It follows a crucial ruling by South Korea’s constitutional court last August which found that the government’s climate policies violated the rights of future generations by failing to set legally binding targets for 2031-50.\nIn March, residents and activists filed another suit over the government’s approval of the world’s largest semiconductor cluster in Yongin, backed by a 360tn won (£195bn) Samsung investment. The suit argues that the project’s 10GW electricity demand and new LNG plants contradict climate regulations and corporate sustainability commitments.\nJungwon Kim, a youth activist, sees this as a generational struggle. “Growing up in Pohang, I saw smokestacks fill the sky on my way to school every day. My throat would hurt from fine dust, and iron particles would collect on our windowsills,” she recalls.\n“Adults always said: ‘Thanks to Posco, our region survives.’ I don’t want my child to grow up with that same false choice between a healthy environment and economic survival.”\nThe international data shows that South Korea’s emissions peaked in 2018, and have been falling, with a brief jump after Covid, ever since. The government maintains that it is making progress on its climate goals, although critics argue that it is relying on some wonky calculations around its 2030 emission reduction target, confusing net with gross emissions.\n“South Korea is actively pursuing bold reduction of coal power generation through prohibiting new permits for coal power plants and phasing out ageing facilities,” the ministry said in a statement, arguing that any remaining coal plants operating beyond 2050, such as those approved before the 2021 ban, would be addressed through “carbon capture and storage technology and clean fuel conversion” in a way “not inconsistent with our carbon neutrality commitment”.\nBut independent analysis suggests these measures fall well short. “The Basic Plan has no specific plan for how to expand renewable energy,” says Prof Park. “There are vague targets, but no timeline, no locations. In stark contrast, the nuclear roadmap is extremely detailed and specific.”\nHis recent research using the Global Change Assessment Model shows the current plan would fall short of meeting South Korea’s 2030 emissions targets by approximately 6-7%.\nA more ambitious policy focused on offshore wind expansion and a complete phase-out of coal by 2035 could not only meet climate goals but reduce power sector emissions by 82% by 2035.\nWhen confronted with criticisms of its emissions accounting, South Korea’s environment ministry defended its approach: “Our emissions reduction target calculation method considers international regulations and major country cases. Countries like Japan and Canada use similar calculation methods for their 2030 NDCs,” a spokesperson said.\nThe ministry added that although previous targets used the older 1996 IPCC guidelines, from 2024 they have begun using the updated 2006 standards for national greenhouse gas statistics.\nBack in Samcheok, Eunbin Kang looks out at the coal plant that now dominates the coastal landscape.\n“I dream of a society where exploitation and plunder are replaced by decentralisation and autonomy,” she says. “I want to contribute to spreading lifestyles and policies that allow everyone to lead a good life without requiring a lot of electricity or money.”"

    "raw_text": "Britain’s clean energy future risks creating “winners and losers” if lower-income households are not shielded from the costs added to energy bills to pay for it, the head of the energy regulator has said.\nJonathan Brearley, Ofgem’s chief executive, said a “systematic approach” to sharing the rising costs of the government’s green power ambitions was needed to avoid poorer households facing soaring monthly payments.\nThe regulator for Great Britain launched a root-and-branch review on Wednesday into how the costs of upgrading the energy networks can be recovered through home energy bills in a way that is fairer.\nThe review could include plans to cut standing charges for lower-income households while wealthier customers pay a higher cost for upgrading the energy system.\nBrearley told the Guardian: “All of these changes that one might make to create a better energy system will have winners and losers. It may well be that the best thing to do is to have a more systematic answer to the question of affordability.”\nThis would allow the country to make sweeping changes to the energy system “without always living in fear that you’re going to make some people on low income even worse off”, he added.\nEnergy affordability has become a rising concern in Whitehall in recent years as gas and electricity bills have become a larger part of each household’s total costs, while the levies used to support grid upgrades and low-carbon energy projects have become a larger part of energy bills.\nThis trend is likely to accelerate, according to industry experts. As Great Britain begins to rely more on cheaper homegrown renewable energy the cost of electricity may fall but the fixed costs levied on to bills will continue to rise to cover the costs of a changing energy system.\nCurrently the cost of maintaining the pipes and wires that deliver the gas and electricity to homes and businesses is recouped through standing charges on home energy bills. These fixed daily charges, which also include the cost of fitting smart meters and other policy costs, are applied to energy bills regardless of how much energy a bill payer uses.\nThis means cash-strapped households who are unable to heat their homes still bear the full brunt of covering energy network costs while vulnerable consumers – who are often high users of energy for medical or health needs – will also end up paying above the odds to maintain the grid.\nThe standing charge has ballooned in recent years from an average of £182.27 a year five years ago to an average of £334.07 a year – or almost a fifth of the average annual energy bill.\nThese costs have been described by the consumer champion Martin Lewis as “a moral hazard”, and could climb further as the UK prepares to invest heavily in upgrading its electricity grids to meet the government’s goal of creating a clean energy system by 2030.\n“We want to get under the skin of how those costs are allocated across the system,” Brearley said. “Is it still right that we have variable charges by region? If we are wanting to encourage people to use energy when [renewable energy] is more abundant, then is there a way to allocate these costs to do this? And should this be on the volumetric charge or the standing charge?”"

It is a great shame that some politicians would rather attack the sector instead of seizing the huge potential that it offers.”\nThe Renewable UK trade association said this month that the number of people working in the offshore wind industry had climbed by a quarter in the last two years, from just over 32,000 to nearly 40,000. It estimated that 74,000 to 95,000 people will be needed to meet the government’s goal of quadrupling offshore wind power production by the end of the decade, with the highest numbers of new jobs expected to be created in Scotland, the east of England, and in Yorkshire and the Humber.\nAna Musat, the association’s policy director, said: “Every recent opinion poll shows that the vast majority of people support the development of renewable energy.\n“New wind and solar farms are not only driving new jobs and investment into places like the Humber, Teesside and Scotland, but generating more power in our own country will ultimately reduce our reliance on gas imports, the price of which is determined by international markets and events.”\nJess Ralston, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “Arguing against British renewables is arguing for more foreign gas, which will increasingly come from abroad as the North Sea continues its inevitable decline – a geological fact.”\nShe added that “ripping up long-term policies and changing agreed contracts is likely to destroy the UK’s credibility as a solid place to invest” in clean energy, which would make the UK more exposed to spikes in imported gas prices."

    "raw_text": "Britain is expected to fall short of the progress needed to meet its climate targets over the next decade because it is not growing its supply of clean electricity quickly enough, according to the government’s energy system operator.\nThe latest 10-year forecast of Britain’s carbon emissions by the government-owned body has revealed that by 2035 the UK will be producing almost a third more carbon emissions than in scenarios where it is on track to meet its legally binding climate targets by 2050.\nIt is the second official warning in the last month that the government’s climate targets are at risk of being derailed, after the Committee on Climate Change reported that two-fifths of the emissions reductions needed to meet the UK’s interim climate target by the end of the decade still have significant risks or insufficient plans to deliver them.\nThe latest forecast report, published by the National Energy System Operator (Neso), represents the operator’s current view of the next 10 years based on the UK’s existing project pipelines and policies to highlight “the difference between where we are heading compared [with] where we need to get to”.\nIt suggests that the UK will produce 274m tonnes of carbon (MtCO2) by 2035, well above the 185–204MtCO2 range shown in the same year for the Neso scenarios in which the UK meets the government’s net zero target by 2050.\nFintan Slye, the chief executive of Neso, said the energy system’s climate progress “isn’t enough” and the UK would “need to go further and faster, accelerating the rollout of clean energy technologies” to bring about a clean and affordable energy system in the long-term.\n“The choices made today will shape the success of each wave of Britain’s transition. That means speeding up the adoption of energy efficiency measures, empowering households and businesses to make informed choices on things like demand flexibility, buying an electric car and switching to low-carbon heating,” Slye said.\nThe system operator, which was acquired by the government from the energy company National Grid last year, said halving the UK’s emissions to about 200MtCO2 would “only be possible by accelerating the mainstream use of low-carbon technologies”, from the UK’s industrial bases through to homes and transport.\nHowever, the Neso’s own data shows that the UK’s growing clean electricity supplies are on track to fall short of the progress needed to reach net zero. The UK is expected to reach 148GW of renewable electricity by 2035, according to the 10-year forecast, but it would need between 170GW and 190GW by this time in scenarios where the UK meets its 2050 climate goals.\nThe findings are likely to pile pressure on the government’s plans to boost investment in renewables and more energy-efficient homes.\nEd Miliband, the energy secretary, accused politicians who reject net zero policies of betraying future generations, in a “state of the climate” address to the House of Commons. The intervention is expected to counter the anti-climate rhetoric of the Conservative party, which has vowed to abandon the 2050 net zero target, and Reform UK, which pledged to scrap all net zero policies and subsidies for renewable energy.\nA government spokesperson said: “This report sets out the need to accelerate the country’s progress to clean power – which is exactly what we are doing by sprinting to clean power by 2030 and delivering the most significant investment in history in clean, homegrown energy that we control.\n“Our actions over the last year have already laid strong foundations for achieving this mission – by approving projects that could power 2m homes, attracting over £40bn in private-sector investment, setting up the publicly owned Great British Energy, launching a new golden age of nuclear power, and introducing plans to upgrade millions of homes to cut bills for homeowners and renters.”"

    "raw_text": "The government’s decision on zonal pricing for electricity – the issue that divides the energy industry like no other – is due any day. Whichever way ministers jump, it would be a good moment to update consumers on the outlook for their bills in the “sprint” to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2030. Does the government still think cleaner energy means cheaper energy? If so, when and how?\nIt deserves an answer for two reasons. First, because the costs of turning down gas-fired generation in favour of renewables are clearer than a year ago – and current trends, sadly, are not encouraging. Second, because promising consumers “up to £300” off their bills by 2030 via clean energy, as Keir Starmer and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, have done, risks handing a political gift to anti-net zero opponents if the savings do not materialise.\nThat is not to dispute the need to decarbonise the grid. More wind, solar, batteries and interconnectors are the only way to reduce emissions across the whole economy. For the government, there is an extra incentive to protect itself against the risk of a 2022-style rise in the price of gas after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Treasury could ill afford to subsidise household bills again, given the fragile public finances.\nBut the government’s claims about clean energy tend to go further. The promise, as conveyed by the £300 pledge, is that we can also save money on the way to 2030. Really? The gas price is back at its 10-year average in real terms, while renewables have lost the financing whoosh they enjoyed from ultra-low interest rates. It becomes harder to see how a £200bn five-year transition from dirty but reliable fossil fuels to a cleaner but more complex intermittent system can be costless for consumers.\n“I fully support the move to a cleaner energy system,” wrote Chris O’Shea, the chief executive of British Gas-owning Centrica, on LinkedIn a few weeks ago, before tackling the “confusion” over whether renewables will bring down energy prices from where they are now: “The build out of renewables will not materially reduce UK electricity prices from current levels. They may give price stability, and avoid future price spikes based on the international gas market, but they will definitely not reduce the price.”\nHis point is that there is now little difference between the average wholesale price of electricity, which is usually set by gas-fired plants, and the prices to be paid to offshore wind developers whose projects won contracts-for-difference (CfDs) in last year’s auction.\nCfDs are the price-guarantee mechanism, funded by bill payers, that encourages developers to build. Projects get the “strike” price for their electricity regardless of the wholesale price. Last year’s CfDs for fixed offshore wind, viewed as “the bedrock” of a cleaned-up system, were priced at £76-£82 in 2024 money, which at the top end is the same as the average wholesale price of electricity over the past year.\nO’Shea could have added the qualification that CfDs only last for 15 years, so there could be gains when the subsidies eventually fall away. In terms of 2030, however, that moment is over the horizon. Today’s outlook is not the happy world of 2022 when CfDs for offshore wind arrived at £53.50 (in today’s money) and the turbines could legitimately be said to be outcompeting gas.\nThus the outcome of the next auctions for renewables projects is critical. Vallorii, an Oxford-based financial risk-modelling company, estimates that CfDs for offshore wind will be up again to £90-£111 a megawatt hour (in today’s money) in this year’s auction – well above current wholesale prices. That is even if the government doesn’t adopt zonal pricing – the proposal that Great Britain’s electricity market should be split into regions with prices set by local supply and demand – which could inflate numbers further.\nWe’ll see what the auction produces, but Vallorii’s projection is credible for the reasons it gives. There are bottlenecks in supply chains, as evidenced by the Danish company Ørsted stopping work on its giant Hornsea 4 windfarm because it couldn’t make the numbers add up even with a 2024-vintage CfD.\nWindfarms are also capital-intensive schemes where borrowing costs make a huge difference: we are not in the 2022 era of ultra-cheap money. That may be why the energy department is flirting with the idea of extending this year’s CfD contracts to 20 years in the hope of reducing the headline rate, albeit at the cost of locking it up for longer.\nMeanwhile, the cost of rewiring the grid is adding up. Ofgem last week backed £24bn of spending on gas and electricity networks as the first part of a package that, for electricity alone, will reach £80bn over five years. That will add £104 to annual network charges on bills, the regulator said, although it also offered a net figure of £24 that includes the savings from keeping a lid on “balancing costs”, meaning costs associated with paying windfarms (usually in Scotland) not to generate when the system is overloaded.\nEven with the investment in new transmission capacity, however, such balancing costs are still projected to increase from £2.7bn last year to £4bn in 2030 – and that assumes the new high-voltage infrastructure arrives on time.\nSuch a system-wide perspective – counting all the costs and levies, rather than focusing narrowly on renewables’ undoubted ability to reduce wholesale prices – is how energy analysts tend to look at transformation.\nThree conclusions from Aurora Energy Research’s modelling earlier this year stand out. First, CfD clearing prices are key. Second, the high upfront cost of renewables means building a clean power system is always sensitive to changes in the cost of capital. Third – and critically – “due to the long lead times on energy infrastructure, a clean power system would only start saving bill payers from 2044”.\nThat assessment sounds uncomfortably like the reality. Overhauling a system that was largely built and designed in the 1950s and 1960s is a huge undertaking. It should not be surprising if the benefits in bills take ages to emerge. To repeat, that is not an argument against rolling out renewables. But it is a reason to be honest about costs, uncertainties, the effect of interest rates and bond yields and the inevitable trade-offs that come with tight deadlines. Clean power is not a free lunch."

    "raw_text": "From herb boxes and flower pots to washing lines and hanging baskets, residents of Madrid, Berlin and other European cities are well versed at making the most of their compact balconies – even generating power for wifi, the kettle and the TV.\n“Balcony solar” allows urbanites to install a small number of panels in the tight space outside apartments, which generate electricity that can be used for the household. Soon flat owners and renters in the UK could be able to use the same “plug-in” technology, which is currently prohibited.\nThe DIY systems, which have grown in popularity in countries such as France, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, are typically plugged straight into the home’s power sockets, saving money on electricity bills and allowing people access to a new source of power.\nSo why can’t balconies in the UK simply have the same systems installed?\nBritish regulations around solar systems and wiring mean that professionals must be involved in their installation and the panels cannot simply be plugged into the mains like a toaster.\nIn some European countries, where electrical systems are different to the UK, residents are allowed to put in place their own small systems – such as a few panels being hung off a balcony.\nThomas Newby of the Leeds-based engineering company Morgan & Newby says this difference in regulation means the technology has grown in popularity. In Germany, Balkonkraftwerk (balcony power plant) systems are now installed at 1.5m apartments.\n“Various countries permit systems limited in output to 800W to be connected via a standard appliance plug to a socket-outlet,” he says. “As a result of this lower-cost entry point, well suited to apartments where the solar modules can be hung or positioned on the balcony, uptake has increased significantly of late.”\nThis week the UK government said it would launch a safety study “with the aim of unlocking opportunities for plug-in solar over the next few years” as part of a new plan to triple the UK’s solar capacity by 2030.\nIn theory, this could mean people in flats would have a much cheaper way to access solar energy, as the cost of labour is taken off the bill. And renters could take the systems with them when they move from flat to flat. This would give people who usually do not have access to cheap power a way to reduce their energy bills.\nNewby said a typical kit containing two solar panels, a battery to store energy and the plugs needed to convert it to the household electrics would cost about £2,000. Batteries are used to store energy, which is generated and not used immediately in the home, especially on sunny days such as those experienced last month, when temperatures reached 33C.\nThe study by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will look at whether the plug-in systems would be safe to use in the UK, where the electricity supply system is significantly different to countries such as Germany.\nSolar Energy UK, the trade body for the industry, said the installation of plug-in solar panels is not allowed under building regulations or planning policy.\n“This is due to a range of considerations including aesthetics, structural/building safety and consumer safety. There are other practical considerations including the location of electric sockets and cable protection – we do not tend to have electrical sockets installed on balconies in this country,” said Gemma Grimes, director of policy.\n“The installation of all electrical equipment comes with risks, and it is important that any risks are fully understood prior to widespread rollout. We are aware of examples on the continent – including Germany – and are keen to learn from their experience.”"

    "raw_text": "Those living in flats or rented homes in the UK could soon plug in their own “balcony solar panels” to save on their energy bills under plans set out in the government’s solar power strategy.\nThe proposals could mean that British households that are unable to install rooftop solar panels will soon join millions of people across Europe who generate their own electricity with “plug-in” panels.\nThese panels, found on balconies across Spain and Germany, can be plugged directly into a home’s power socket to generate solar electricity for the household.\nThe DIY panels are already fitted to about 1.5m balconies in Germany, where they are known as Balkonkraftwerk (balcony power plant). They typically save households about 30% on their energy bills and cost between €400-800, with no installation fees required, meaning they pay for themselves within six years.\nThere is also growing interest in balcony solar across Spain, Italy, Poland and in France. But in the UK, regulations do not currently allow plug-in solar, meaning bill payers in flats or rented homes are often blocked from benefiting from cheap solar power, while others face hurdles due to the relatively high upfront cost of installing traditional rooftop solar systems.\nMichael Shanks, the energy minister, said: “Through solar, we are rolling out the quickest to build and one of the cheapest forms of energy for families to start saving hundreds on their energy bills, all while helping tackle the climate crisis.”\nThe government has promised to consult on the plans to bring balcony solar power from the continent to Britain as part of a new roadmap towards tripling the UK’s solar power capacity, published on Monday.\nMinisters are also considering the potential to install more rooftop solar on the canopies of large outdoor car ports and believe there is significant scope to install solar panels on warehouse and factory roofs.\nJust 20% of the UK’s biggest warehouses could provide up to 15 gigawatts of solar capacity – or half the planned growth by the end of the decade, according to the government’s clean power plan.\nThe plans to back rooftop solar are likely to find strong support from consumer groups and local community campaigners concerned about the impact of the government’s ambitious targets for Britain’s countryside and farmland.\nThe government has promised that its solar ambitions will require less than half a percent of the UK’s total land.\nEd Miliband, the energy secretary, hopes to grow the capacity of the UK’s solar farms from 18GW today to between 45 and 47GW by the end of the decade.\nHe has already approved a string of major solar farms across the Midlands since the Labour party came to power last year, including the largest solar farm in the UK at the old Cottam coal plant site on the borders of Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire.\nThe goal set out in the roadmap is slightly lower than the Labour party’s election manifesto pledge to triple the UK’s solar capacity to 50GW by 2030, but the strategy has suggested that the UK may be able to overshoot the target by up to 10GW if rooftop solar panels are included in the tally.\nThe government has promised that families could save about £500 a year on their energy bills by installing rooftop solar panels as part of the government’s solar strategy, which could support up to 35,000 jobs.\nChris Stark, who leads the government’s clean power “mission control” unit, said the “once in a generation increase” in solar power would “only be possible with a mission-focus” on working in partnership with the industry and reforming the queue of solar projects waiting to join the grid."

    "raw_text": "Turning recently closed coalmines into solar energy plants could add almost 300GW of renewable energy by 2030, converting derelict wastelands to productive use, according to a new report.\nIn a first of its kind analysis, researchers from Global Energy Monitor (GEM) identified 312 surface coalmines closed since 2020 around the world, and 134 likely to close by the end of the decade, together covering 5,820 sq km (2,250 sq miles) – a land area nearly the size of Palestine.\nStrip mining turns terrains into wastelands, polluted and denuded of topsoil. But if they were filled with solar panels and developed into energy plants, the report claims, they could generate enough energy to power as big and power hungry a nation as Germany.\nCheng Cheng Wu, the project manager for the energy transition tracker at GEM, said: “The legacy of coal is written into the land, but that legacy does not have to define the future. The coalmine to solar transition is under way, and this potential is ready to be unlocked in major coal producers like Australia, the US, Indonesia and India.\n“Repurposing mines for solar development offers a rare chance to bring together land restoration, local job creation, and clean energy deployment in a single strategy. With the right choices, the same ground that powered the industrial era can help power the climate solutions we now urgently need.”\nOnce lauded as exploiting the “buried sunshine” of the past, burning coal for energy is gradually being phased out around the world because of its high carbon emissions. At the same time, solar energy has become more accessible and affordable.\nIn 2024, 599GW of solar energy capacity was installed around the world, and there are more than 2,000GW of utility scale solar projects in development, GEM said. Globally, the total installed photovoltaic capacity late last year surpassed 2TW (terawatts), according to the Global Solar Council.\nBut the need for space to lay out sufficient solar panels has led to land use conflicts, with the farming and nature conservation lobbies – among others – objecting to solar developments.\nUsing mined-out lands could be a partial solution to such conflicts, GEM says, adding that such sites were already primed for development, with 96% of recently abandoned mines less than 10km from an electricity grid.\nIt would also mitigate unemployment crises in former coal communities, such as those in many parts of the UK when the government shut down the country’s coal industry in the 1980s.\nGEM estimates that 259,700 permanent jobs in manufacturing, wholesale trade and distribution, and professional services could be created at coal-to-solar transition sites, and an additional 317,500 temporary and construction jobs – together, more than the number of workers the coal industry will shed by 2035.\nRyan Driskell Tate, an associate director at GEM, said: “We’ve seen what happens in coal communities when companies go bankrupt, axe the workers, and leave a mess behind. But mined-out coalfields harbour huge potential for powering a clean energy future.\n“It’s already happening. We just need the right mix of incentives to put people to work building the next generation of solar in coal country.”"

    "raw_text": "One of the UK’s biggest energy developers will cut its planned spending on new renewables projects in a blow to the government’s 2030 clean power targets.\nSSE warned that it would be unlikely to meet its own renewable energy goals for the end of the decade after shrinking its five-year spending plans by £3bn to £17.5bn.\nThe spending cuts will include investing £1.5bn less on developing renewable energy initiatives, including offshore windfarms and a hydropower project, with another £1.5bn cut from its planned spending on other energy and transmission projects.\nSSE’s outgoing chief executive, Alistair Phillips-Davies, blamed “delays to policy and planning” and “a changing macro environment” for the spending cuts, which have cast fresh doubt on the government’s clean power goals.\nPhillips-Davies said the company had faced delays to two Scottish renewable energy projects – the Coire Glas hydropower project in the Highlands, and the Berwick Bank offshore windfarm development, which was submitted to the Scottish government for approval in late 2022.\nTogether these renewable energy projects would power the equivalent of approximately 9m households in the UK once operating. SSE has also faced delays to the second phase of its Arklow Bank offshore windfarm off the Irish coast.\nThe government had aimed to double the UK’s onshore wind power, triple its solar power, and quadruple its offshore wind capacity by 2030 as part of a plan to create a power system 95% free of fossil fuels.\nSSE had expected to help the government meet these goals by increasing its renewable energy generation fivefold to 50 terrawatt hours (TWh) by 2030. Its renewable energy generation output climbed by 18% last year to reach 13.3TWh in March of this year.\nSSE’s step back from renewable energy investment will enable the FTSE 100 energy group to focus on investing in high-voltage power cables and local electricity distribution grids, which provide predictable, regulated returns.\nThe company’s overall adjusted profits slipped by 3% to £2.14bn for the year.\nPhillips-Davies used his final statement before he steps down from the role later this year to underline the company’s commitment to developing new offshore windfarms in UK waters.\nHe said SSE would continue its pace of investment, which stands at £8m a day, and called for stable market conditions and low risk to support its ambitions.\nThis includes scrapping proposals to replace Great Britain’s electricity market with a series of zonal markets with prices set by local supply and demand, according to Phillips-Davies. “While the market needs reform, it does not need zonal [pricing],” he said.\n“We’ve seen a whole swathe of the industry – all the main developers – come out firmly against zonal. It adds a whole lot of uncertainty and tens of billions of pounds to the cost of getting to net zero by 2030. It also introduces – tragically – a potential postcode lottery on people’s bills,” he said."

    "raw_text": "Demand for copper, needed for the transition to a low-carbon world, will outstrip supply within the next decade, according to the global energy watchdog.\nSupplies of the metal, a key component of every form of electrical energy system at present, will fall 30% short of the amount required by 2035 if nothing is done, analysis by the International Energy Agency predicts.\nFatih Birol, the executive director of the IEA, said: “This will be a major challenge. It’s time to sound the alarm.”\nHe said developed countries should aim to do more of the refining of copper and other key metals needed for industry, and form partnerships with developing countries to do so.\nCritical minerals that are necessary for manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines, and transforming the global energy system, are overwhelmingly being refined in China, though they are mined in many locations, including Africa, Australia and Latin America.\nChina processes more than 70% on average of the world’s top 20 minerals needed in the energy industry, according to IEA data. Elements such as cobalt, gallium, lithium and manganese are used in the production of batteries and electrical components needed for renewable energy generation.\nThis stranglehold is increasing, even though the prices of many critical minerals have fallen from the highs of 2021 and 2022, when the shock of the Covid pandemic created a supply crunch. The average share of the top suppliers is expected to decline only marginally over the next decade.\nBirol said more must be done to increase the supply of critical minerals if the world was to shift to a low-carbon economy.\n“Diversification is key,” he said. “The UK, Europe, Japan, the US, South Korea – the technology is there. Africa, Latin America have the resources. There could be international cooperation among countries.”\nGovernments should intervene, as market forces alone would not solve the problem, he added. “There is a need for government policies, to support new entrants [in the market],” he said.\nDeveloping these industries and trade links would diversify the global supply and could prevent bottlenecks and potential price rises, like those seen in 2021. “If the costs go up, that would be a major, if not the most important, hurdle” to shifting to a green economy, Birol said. “This is a major, major issue.”\nCopper must be a key concern, he added. It takes on average 17 years from the discovery of new deposits to the production of the metal.\n“We have analysed all the copper mining, in Latin America, Africa, Australia – all the pipelines,” said Birol. “[Rising costs would] make the cost of the green transition significantly higher, and may lead to delay.”\nBut he said that if governments took rapid action, they could reduce the projected shortfall. “[A supply crunch] is not inevitable. We can soften it if we move very fast, by putting new projects to market very fast, by recycling copper, and substituting copper with other metals such as aluminium, to alleviate the problem.”\nChina’s build-out of its electricity grids, as it moves to clean energy and the manufacturing of clean technology components such as solar panels and wind turbines, has been the biggest factor behind the sharp increase in demand for copper in recent years.\nThe need for other critical minerals has also increased rapidly. Demand for lithium rose by nearly 30% last year.\nThe IEA warned that any disruption to supply would be dangerous, not only for the green energy transition but also to the wider global economy.\n“The impact of a critical minerals supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness,” according to the report.\n“A sustained supply shock for battery metals could increase global average battery pack prices by as much as 40-50%.”"

The result will be announced on 25 October.\nWhile a series of names have been mentioned as possible candidates since Rayner resigned as deputy prime minister and housing secretary on Friday over the underpayment of stamp duty on a second home, several have since said they will not stand.\nMahmood, who moved from the justice department to the Home Office on Friday as part of a wide-reaching reshuffle after Rayner’s departure, ruled herself out on Monday.\n“I’m the home secretary, so that is my job, and my top priority is securing our borders,” she told Sky News in a pooled interview. “I will not be running for deputy leader of the Labour party.”\nPhillips, the safeguarding minister, also said she would not stand, and it is understood that Nandy, who stayed on as culture secretary in the reshuffle, has also decided not to.\nEmily Thornberry, who was shadow attorney general but was removed by Keir Starmer after the election and now chairs the foreign affairs select committee, is expected to stand.\nOther possible contenders cited include the former transport secretary Louise Haigh, Lucy Powell, who was removed as Commons leader in the reshuffle, as well as Stella Creasy, Sarah Owen, Anneliese Dodds, Dawn Butler, Meg Hillier, and figures from the left of the party including Richard Burgon and Nadia Whittome.\nCreasy, the Walthamstow MP who came second to Tom Watson for the same post in 2015, refused to rule herself out when asked by the BBC on Monday.\nHowever, the number of MPs needed plus the speed of the nominations process – Burgon called the latter a “stitch-up” – means the eventual pool of candidates is likely to be small.\nRayner served as deputy PM, but the party deputy leadership is separate to any government role and is voted on by members rather than decided by the PM.\nWhile deputy party leaders almost always hold senior cabinet or shadow cabinet posts, a government source confirmed there was no rule saying this had to be the case, meaning the winner of the contest would not necessarily be made a minister if not one already."

    "raw_text": "Angela Rayner has stood down from the government after the prime minister’s ethics adviser found she had breached the ministerial code over her underpayment of stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside flat.\nIn a huge blow to Keir Starmer, Sir Laurie Magnus found that Rayner had “acted with integrity and with a dedicated and exemplary commitment to public service” but concluded she had breached the ministerial code over her tax affairs.\nRayner’s departure is deeply damaging for the prime minister, who initially stood firmly by her, and his authority has been badly bruised as a result. She has quit as his deputy and housing secretary, and as deputy leader of the Labour party.\nDowning Street sources confirmed the prime minister would now conduct a reshuffle, but that Rachel Reeves would remain in post as chancellor.\nIn her resignation letter, Rayner said that she “deeply regrets” her decision not to seek “additional specialist tax advice” over her purchase of the Hove property.\nShe said she also had to “consider the significant toll that the ongoing pressure of the media” was taking on her family, despite her journey from “a teenage mum from a council estate in Stockport” to the highest level of government being “the honour of my life”.\nIn his handwritten response, Starmer said Rayner would “remain a major figure in our party” and would “continue to fight for the causes you care so passionately about”.\nRayner’s departure leaves the Labour government without one of its most authentic – and powerful – working-class voices at a time when it is struggling to reconnect with its traditional voter base and trailing Reform UK in the polls.\nRayner had referred herself to the ethics adviser after confirming she would have to pay more stamp duty – which experts have predicted could run to as much as £40,000 – because she had incorrectly paid the lower rate on the flat in Hove.\nAt the time, Rayner said she “deeply regretted” that the error had been made, after classifying the flat as her only property despite spending much of her time with her children at the family house in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester.\nMonths before the Hove purchase, she had put her stake in the Ashton house into a trust set up in 2020 to manage a payment to one of her sons, who after a “deeply personal and distressing incident” as a premature baby had been left with lifelong disabilities.\nBecause her son is the beneficiary of that trust and is under 18, Rayner was still counted as having a financial interest in it for tax purposes.\nHowever, when she bought the Hove flat, she declared she did not have an interest in any other property, allowing her to pay the lower stamp-duty rate of about £30,000. The higher rate would have been an estimated £70,000.\nThough she claimed to have received written tax advice before completing her purchase, saying she was entitled to pay the lower amount, Rayner’s conveyancer said on Thursday she had not provided any such advice.\nMagnus revealed on Friday that two experts in trusts had also advised the then deputy prime minister to take full legal advice before buying the property, which she did not do.\nHe said in his letter: “Given the conjunction of the acknowledged complexity of her family circumstances, her position in government (most importantly as deputy prime minister) and the consequences of getting such a calculation wrong, it is deeply regrettable that the specific tax advice was not sought.”\nMagnus added it was “highly unfortunate” that she had not paid the right amount of tax given she was also housing secretary.\nThe controversy was made even more awkward for the government by the fact that Reeves is thought to be considering higher property taxes in November’s budget – in part at the prompting of Rayner herself.\nIn a memo to the chancellor earlier this year Rayner suggested raising stamp duty on commercial properties, warning that the existing 5% rate was encouraging individuals to buy properties through shell companies.\nNigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, said Rayner’s resignation “screams to entitlement”.\nHe added: “It screams to a government that despite all the promises that this would be a new, different kind of politics is as bad – if not worse – than the one that went before.”\nThe Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said Rayner’s position was “untenable for days”. In a video posted on X, she added: “It says everything about Keir Starmer’s weak leadership that he had to wait for a report before acting.\n“The truth is simple, she dodged tax. She lied about it. Her position was untenable for days.”"

    "raw_text": "David Lammy has been made deputy prime minister and Yvette Cooper has taken over as foreign secretary as Keir Starmer embarked on a massive reshuffle sparked by the forced departure of Angela Rayner from government.\nImmediate changes were required due to Rayner’s resignation as deputy PM and housing secretary after the prime minister’s ethics adviser found she had breached the ministerial code over her underpayment of stamp duty on a seaside flat.\nBut the extent of the changes, with only a handful of cabinet ministers staying in the same job, indicated concern inside Downing Street that the government is faltering, and the need for a reset.\nShabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, has taken over from Cooper at the Home Office, with Lammy becoming justice secretary as well as his deputy prime minister role.\nPat McFadden, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, has been made work and pensions secretary, overseeing an enhanced department, which will take over Angela Rayner’s housing and communities brief.\nThe department has been tasked with focusing on the government’s growth plans, and is also taking in the skills remit formerly held by the Department for Education. One official described its remit as “jobs, jobs, jobs”, and McFadden will also have to take on the hugely tricky task of overseeing welfare changes, all but abandoned in July after a major pushback from MPs.\nIn what was largely a shuffling round of jobs between existing ministers, Liz Kendall, who was the work and pensions secretary, has taken over as science and technology secretary from Peter Kyle, who becomes trade secretary. He replaces Jonathan Reynolds, who becomes chief whip.\nSteve Reed, the environment secretary, has been moved to cover Rayner’s housing portfolio, a role he held in opposition. Emma Reynolds, formerly a junior Treasury minister who was out of parliament from 2019 to 2024, is promoted to the cabinet to fill Reed’s old job.\nThere is also a return to the cabinet for Douglas Alexander, who becomes Scottish secretary – a role he held under Tony Blair’s government.\nDarren Jones, recently appointed chief secretary to the prime minister, will also become chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, stay in their posts.\nLucy Powell was sacked as Commons leader, replaced by the former chief whip Sir Alan Campbell. Ian Murray, removed as Scottish secretary, also left government.\nAs the prime minister began reshaping his cabinet team, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, was confirmed as staying in place early on, as Downing Street sought to reassure the markets that the economy was in safe hands.\nThe moves by Cooper and Mahmood mean that for the first time ever, the three great offices of state beyond the prime minister – home secretary, foreign secretary and chancellor – are held by women.\nStarmer had been widely expected to carry out a reshuffle, with the timetable forced by Rayner’s resignation after the prime minister’s ethics adviser found she had breached the ministerial code over her underpayment of stamp duty on her £800,000 seaside flat.\nThe first confirmed departure from cabinet was Powell. “This has not been an easy time for the government. People want to see change and improvement to their difficult lives,” she said. The senior Labour MP was swiftly followed out of the door by Murray.\nPosting on X, Murray said he was “hugely disappointed” to be leaving government and warned Starmer that he risked “furthering division and despair” by failing to make a strong enough argument for “progressive change”.\nThe changes come after a shake-up of the No 10 operation earlier in the week.\nAnother of the ministers to stay, Lisa Nandy, was unexpected. When the reshuffle had been anticipated, hers was often one of the main names tipped as being likely to lose her role.\nThe number of changes suggests the extent of worry within No 10 as Labour struggles in the polls, while Reform UK spent much of the summer dominating headlines with policies about migration.\nMahmood, who is very highly rated by Downing Street, will be expected to take a grip of immigration, notably what to do about the arrival of asylum seekers on small boats, and where they are accommodated as their claims are processed.\nOverall, the changes cement the positions of ministers close to Starmer, while bringing in new people such as Alexander and Reynolds, who had been tipped for promotion."

    "raw_text": "Stella Creasy suggests government should scrap law making it offence to express support for proscribed organisation\nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy has urged the government to get rid of the law making it an offence to “recklessly express support for a proscribed organisation”.\nIn a Commons urgent question, triggered by the arrest of almost 900 people in London on Saturday for protesting against the decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation, she said she thought the current law was flawed.\nUnder the Terrorism Act, once an organisation is proscribed, it is not just illegal to be a member; just expressing support for it is an offence.\nCreasy said she was not speaking as a supporter of Palestine Action, and she said the case to act against them was “strong” because of their use of violence.\nBut she said the current situation, which has led to hundreds of people being arrested for holding up banners saying the support Palestine Action, was “just not sustainable”. She explained:\nThere is a difference between people protesting using violence and people protesting the use of proscription.\nIf we don’t get right the response, if we continue to arrest those in that second category, the seriousness the term terrorism risks losing its meaning, becoming diluted rather than strengthened.\nProscription was supposedly about stopping those inciting direct harm and violence.\nGoing after somebody with a poster testing the boundaries of liberty – many of whom are clear they don’t support Palestine Action and feel strongly about Palestinian rights or free speech – confuses rather than clarifies the government’s intention ..\nLegislation on public order focuses on specific acts. Proscription orders target specific terrorist groups. Nothing sits in between this.\nCreasy said the police should be focusing on people who actually are members of Palestine Action. If the government was not willing to abolish the offence of recklessly expressing support for a proscribed group, it should at least give the police guidance on when the offence should be used, she said.\nIn response, Dan Jarvis, the security minister, cited a recent Observer article by Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, in which he defended the use of the legislation against Palestine Action. Hall said:\nThere is no way ordinary criminal law would be effective against funding, training and recruitment [by Palestine Action] …\nThe motives of those who say “I support Palestine Action” are not always easy to discern. Rather than saying “I support Palestine” or “I oppose the proscription of Palestine Action”, a small number of demonstrators have gone out of their way to invite arrest. I am not sure that this makes the law ridiculous or heavy-handed.\nShorn of the power to arrest and prosecute those who display support in public, the police’s role in preventing the growth and operation of Palestine Action would be that much harder.\nJarvis quote an extract from the article and said the government had a duty to ensure public safety.\nEarlier today Creasy did not rule out standing to be Labour’s deputy leader. (See 1.50pm.)\nKeir Starmer has reportedly told a private meeting of Labour MPs that the government will “fight with everything we’ve got” to oppose Nigel Farage, Robert Jenrick and Kemi Badenoch. The meeting is still taking place, and a fuller briefing will be available later. Starmer also praised Angela Rayner for what she achieved with the employment rights bill.\nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has not ruled out running for the deputy leadership, has urged the government to get rid of the law making it an offence to “recklessly express support for a proscribed organisation”. (See 4.34pm.)\nDawn Butler has told Sky News that she is not interested in becoming Labour’s deputy leader. She is more interested in becoming mayor of London, she said.\nLucy Powell, who was leader of the Commons until she was sacked on Friday, is an early frontrunner in the contest to be Labour’s next deputy leader, Kitty Donaldson from the i reports.\nNEW: As of this evening, support in the Labour deputy leadership race is coalescing around Lucy Powell, the Cabinet minister sacked by Sir Keir Starmer on Friday\nLabour MP: “Everybody is currently testing the waters. Obviously, you’ve got some of the people everyone’s known about already. So, Lou Haigh, Lucy Powell, Emily Thornbury, and Rosena Allin-Khan...” BUT\n“There’s a broad consensus it’s got to be a northern woman. As northerners, the people out ahead with the Parliamentary Labour Party are Lucy and Lou, and I would think that from those two, Lucy wins.”\nJohn McTernan, who was political secretary in No 10 to Tony Blair, told Radio 4’s PM programme that he did not think the deputy leadership election would be a proxy leadership election. Instead, it would be about finding “a very strong figure who can speak to and for and on behalf of the party”. He said he thought Alison McGovern would be a “perfect” candidate for that role. (See 3.49pm.)\nWindsor framework trading rules create 'bureaucracy for bureaucracy's sake', Northern Ireland's deputy FM says\nStormont’s deputy first minister has called on the government to act over the Windsor Framework’s “bureaucracy for bureaucracy sake”, PA Media reports.\nThe DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly said some companies will not supply to Northern Ireland because they do not understand the rules put in place following the UK’s exit from the European Union.\nThe Windsor framework, which was agreed in 2023, requires checks and customs paperwork on goods moving from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. Under the arrangements, which were designed to ensure no hardening of the Irish land border post-Brexit, Northern Ireland continues to follow many EU trade and customs rules.\nLittle-Pengelly told the Northern Ireland assembly today there is currently “very little regulatory divergence”, but despite that she said there is “unnecessary checking at the behest of the deal”.\nAs an example, she cited the experience of a man she called Roy from Mid-Ulster who was trying to bring a tractor from Scotland to Northern Ireland.\nHe was requiring four certificates. He couldn’t give the haulage company a specific date as to when he was to get that, and therefore he missed that window and those tractors were stuck in Scotland for four to six weeks despite being paid in full, despite the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.\nThat is not acceptable. It is bureaucracy for bureaucracy’s sake. We need to tackle that.\nThe biggest frustration that people have about governments – should it be here, across the United Kingdom or across the globe – is the fact that it’s so difficult to get things sorted because of this unnecessary, disproportionate, non-risk based nonsense that people are putting in place. They need to get rid of it. It doesn’t serve any purpose. Get it sorted.\nLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, is definitely not running to be Labour’s deputy leader, Pippa Crerar reports.\nLisa Nandy has ruled herself out from running for deputy leader of the Labour party. Despite speculation, I’m told it was never her plan to do so, and she remains fully focused on her role as Culture Secretary.\nBell Ribeiro-Addy, a Labour MP on the left of the party, has joined those saying the timetable for the Labour deputy leadership contest is too short. In a message on social media she said:\nThere is a clear attempt underway to rush the deputy leadership contest.\nAfter the missteps of the past year, we need a proper debate about the future direction of our party; not a coronation.\nIt must be a full and fair contest with a genuine Left candidate on the ballot paper.\nSecurity minister Dan Jarvis says it would have been 'highly irresponsible' to ignore expert advice about proscribing Palestine Action\nDan Jarvis, the security minister, told MPs that it would have been “highly irresponsible” for the government to have ignored expert advice saying Palestine Action should be proscribed.\nResponding to the urgent question tabled by Stella Creasy (see 4.34pm), Jarvis said advice given to the Home Office said the group had met tests to be banned under the Terrorism Act 2000. He went on:\nThese are not the actions of a legitimate protest group. And for a government to ignore expert security assessments, advice and recommendations, would be highly irresponsible.\nWere there to be further serious attacks or injuries, there would rightly be questions asked about why action had not been taken.\nChris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said the Conservatives “fully support, unequivocally, the right to peaceful protest”, but that violence is “never acceptable”.\nThe Labour MP Markus Campbell-Savours asked why arrests were not stopped – as he said he believed that the convictions for displaying proscribed group’s names were “extremely rare”. Jarvis said decisions were down to police judgments made under pressure.\nLisa Nandy, the culture secretary, Emily Thornberry, the chair of the foreign affairs committee, Rosena Allin-Khan, the Tooting MP who resigned from a shadow cabinet job before the election, Anneliese Dodds, the former international development minister, Sarah Owen, chair of the women and equalities committee and Alison McGovern, the local government minister, are all seeking nominations for the deputy Labour leadership election, or have got people doing it on their behalf, Aubrey Allegretti from the Times reports.\nOf these, Allin-Khan would be probably be the most problematic for No 10. She lost her role as a trade envoy after voting against the government on welfare reform in July. But she was runner up to Angela Rayner in the contest in 2020, which should make her a strong candidate if she can get enough support to get her name on the ballot paper.\nRichard Burgon has said the Labour leadership will “move heaven and earth” to stop a leftwing candidate being on the ballot for deputy leader. In an interview with the Left Foot Forward website, Burgon, a leading figure on the Labour left, said:\nThey don’t want Gaza on the ballot paper. They don’t want the winter fuel payment cuts on the ballot paper. They don’t want disability benefit cuts on the ballot paper …\nI think it will be very hard for a left candidate to get on the ballot paper. And the reason for that is because the leadership are making it deliberately very difficult for a left candidate to get on the ballot.\nStreeting says cross-party talks on reforming adult social care have started\nThe long-promised cross-party talks on reforming the adult social care system have started, Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has announced.\nIn a statement today, he said:\nThere’s still a long way to go to guarantee dignified care for all. Our ageing society demands fundamental reform in social care which why the prime minister appointed Baroness Louise Casey to lead an independent commission on adult social care and build consensus for a new National Care Service fit for the 21st century.\nI thank Baroness Casey for arranging today’s meeting, and to cross-party representatives for putting politics aside to find a way forward. I am determined that this government will build a National Care Service worthy of the name.\nThe cross-party talks were meant to start in February, but the process was held up after Casey, who is reviewing social care for the government, was asked to carry out an audit of grooming gang investigations.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Emily Thornberry\nAs someone from the backbenches who is nonetheless of cabinet-level heft, and who is seen as independent but not a recreational rebel, Thornberry is one of the more likely people to reach the nomination threshold.\nAn MP since 2005, Thornberry was shadow attorney general for nearly three years – only to be dumped from the frontbench by Keir Starmer after the general election. She has since become chair of the foreign affairs select committee.\nOne possible barrier for Thornberry is the fact that, like her leader, she is a north London MP. In fact, their constituencies adjoin. Some MPs and members may prefer a wider geographical spread.\nBridget Phillipson\nYes, she’s the education secretary, one of the few cabinet ministers to stay in the same job after last week’s reshuffle prompted by Rayner’s departure, and this could count against her if MPs want their deputy to be more of a voice for the rank and file.\nBut in Phillipson’s favour, she would in some ways be a like-for-like replacement for Rayner, representing a northern seat (Houghton and Sunderland South), and growing up in a council home in Washington, making it from a state school to Oxford University.\nGenerally liked by many MPs and the membership, Phillipson has been a dynamic minister, even if her flagship schools bill attracted some criticism.\nLucy Powell\nPowell would bring a similar geographical balance to Phillipson, given her Manchester constituency, but also some of Thornberry’s outsider status, having lost her job as leader of the Commons in last week’s reshuffle.\nHer former job helped Powell make links with Labour MPs, and as someone on the party’s soft left she would most likely be seen as sufficiently independent of Downing Street without panicking the team around Starmer.\nAlison McGovern\nIn what is becoming something of a theme, the newly minted housing and communities minister (moved on Friday from her employment brief) also represents a northern seat – Birkenhead – and is sufficiently soft left to potentially make MPs and members think she could offer an alternative view to No 10.\nPopular and amiable, McGovern has been an MP since 2010, and was a councillor in Southwark, south London, before then, so knows the party inside out.\nSarah Owen\nOnly an MP since 2019, Owen is relatively little-known outside parliament beyond her Luton North constituency, but has gained a reputation for being an effective and energetic MP and Commons performer, particularly in her current role chairing the women and equalities committee.\nThe first MP of south-east Asian background – her mother has Malaysian Chinese heritage – Owen, who is also on the moderate left of Labour, seemed set for a frontbench career but resigned as a shadow levelling up minister in 2023 in protest at Labour’s stance over Gaza.\nStella Creasy\nThis would not be Creasy’s first tilt at the job, and the Walthamstow MP pointedly refused in a BBC interview on Monday to rule herself out. Back in 2015, she came second to Tom Watson in the members’ vote to succeed Harriet Harman as deputy party leader.\nCreasy is a hugely experienced and highly effective backbench MP and a successful campaigner, if not always an instinctive team player.\nRichard Burgon\nOne of a list of possible representatives from the more robust left of Labour, the Leeds East MP was shadow justice secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, but is now one of the more vocal critics of Starmer from the backbenches.\nIf he did stand, Burgon could struggle to reach 80 endorsements – not least because of the feeling that if Labour still cannot elect a female leader, the deputy should be a woman."

    "raw_text": "Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, has issued a warning to the government, saying it should enact full reforms of workers’ rights in order to fulfil a “promise to the British people”.\nThe trade union leader said that the pledges to enhance the rights of employees were a central part of Labour’s election platform and that unions would not allow the employment rights bill to be weakened.\n“What I do hope is that they don’t intend on now slowing this down, or indeed scrapping some parts of it altogether,” she told the BBC. “You don’t have to be a bad employer to be prosperous. And so therefore, for me, trade unions are the equaliser.\nShe added: “I don’t accept that trade unions and putting up wages is bad for the economy. It’s good for the economy.”\nDowning Street and Labour sources said the legislation would proceed despite pressure from businesses to water down some of the protections against unfair dismissal.\nThe bill includes a bar on exploitative zero-hours contracts, which would only be permitted on the request of an employee, ending most instances of fire and rehire, and day one protection from unfair dismissal – though probation periods will be allowed – as well as protecting workers from harassment.\nGraham has already criticised alterations to the bill during its passage through the Commons, where changes included allowing some instances of fire and rehire when a business would otherwise collapse.\nOne senior government source said the bill would continue as planned: “This reshuffle is about boosting growth, productivity and making people better off. Higher pay and stronger rights for working people is a key part of the government’s programme.”\nPeter Kyle, the new business secretary, phoned union general secretaries over the weekend to reassure them that the bill would go ahead.\nPaul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, who had sought assurances from ministers after Angela Rayner’s departure from cabinet, urged the prime minister to commit to implementing the legislation “in full”.\nIn his speech at the TUC conference on Monday, Nowak will say: “Deliver the manifesto on which you won a huge majority last July. Deliver good jobs, decent public services and better living standards in every corner of the country. Deliver the change people voted for. And show working-class communities whose side you are on.”\nThe bill has been the subject of intensive lobbying from business groups and criticism in the national media, and linked to low growth forecasts. Critics have suggested the increased protection for workers is an additional burden for businesses who have also seen national insurance for employees increase.\nThe Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said it was an opportunity to drop a bill that the Tories had opposed. “Angela Rayner’s job-destroying bill is hated by every credible business figure in the country and will cost firms over £5bn according to the government’s own analysis,” she said.\n“With his deputy gone, Starmer must now focus on the dire economic situation. If he’s serious about delivering economic growth, his latest reset must start with the end of this disastrous bill. It’s the one request from every business I’ve spoken to, especially small business owners.”\nPolling has found Labour’s employment rights bill could substantially increase the party’s plunging popularity with Reform and former Conservative voters, though there is little public knowledge of the changes.\nAmong the most popular policies is one on workers’ prevention from harassment, which has a high favourability rating – despite significant criticism from Nigel Farage, Reform UK politicians and the Conservatives, who have sought to portray it as a “banter ban”."

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer has been warned by senior Labour figures to stop making mistakes, before a battle over the party’s deputy leadership and amid fears the government could row back on workers’ rights.\nAs candidates began to jostle to replace Angela Rayner, the prime minister faced public criticism from Emily Thornberry, a potential contender, who said further mistakes from Starmer could lead to having to “hand our country to [Nigel] Farage”.\nAndy Burnham also called for a “reset” and more pluralistic style, telling the Guardian that the government needed to be “listening to the heartbeat of the party”.\nThe Greater Manchester mayor, considered a future candidate to succeed Starmer, cannot run for the deputy leadership but he endorsed either Louise Haigh or Lucy Powell – two former cabinet ministers sacked by the prime minister.\nAt the same time, union leaders advised Starmer on Sunday against any attempt to water down Angela Rayner’s employment rights bill, which is still making its way through parliament.\nRayner’s employment minister, Justin Madders, was also removed from his job in the reshuffle. He said on Sunday it “would be really, really foolish for the government to row back on key manifesto commitments that are popular with the public and will show what a positive difference a Labour government can make”.\nDowning Street and Labour sources insisted the legislation would proceed despite pressure from businesses to water down some of the protections against unfair dismissal. One senior government source said: “This reshuffle is about boosting growth, productivity and making people better off. Higher pay and stronger rights for working people is a key part of the government’s programme.”\nNevertheless, there was still a high degree of nervousness among unions, with Peter Kyle, the new business secretary, phoning general secretaries this weekend to reassure them that the bill would go ahead.\nPaul Nowak, the TUC general secretary, urged the prime minister to commit to implementing the legislation “in full”; while the Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “If they don’t become a workers’ government, the workers will seek other answers. The stark warnings are already there.”\nIt is understood Starmer’s first meeting of his reshuffled cabinet on Tuesday will focus solely on growing the economy.\nNo 10 is braced for a deputy leadership contest in which candidates publicly criticise Starmer’s first year in government, and during which Nigel Farage’s Reform party has risen in the polls.\nThey have attempted to head off the criticism with a decisive reshuffle of ministers and change of senior aides in No 10, acknowledging that they want to speed up the pace of policies.\nHowever, there is already deep anxiety among Labour MPs about the direction of the reshuffle, which promoted a number of ministers seen as being favoured by the right of the party, including Shabana Mahmood, Pat McFadden, and Peter Kyle.\nOne senior Labour source said the reshuffle was an example of “groupthink”, adding that whether “they win or lose in May, it’s all on them as there’s no one now who isn’t signed up to this way of working. It’s clear from this reshuffle they aren’t interested in listening.\n“This is going to reinforce rather than solve their problems - the deputy contest then takes on the form of an intervention and not just filling a vacancy.”\nThornberry told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “Domestically, things just don’t seem to be working … People hear about the mistakes. And the question is, why are we making these mistakes?\n“We can’t afford to keep doing this, because we’ve gone from having the fantastic gift from the British public of a huge majority to now being at 20% in the polls, and we will have in the next election the biggest fight of our lives coming against Farage. And the last thing we want is to go from a position where it was thought we would be in for two terms, to hand our country over to Farage.”\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Burnham issued a similar message on the need for greater listening across the party. “Labour’s got to be less factional and more inclusive, more pluralistic. If he’s going to rise to the challenge ahead of us, all parts of the Labour family need to be involved and engaged in adding what they can. And certainly the Labour governments I was in worked more like that.”\nThe Guardian can also reveal that Burnham is backing a new political network called Mainstream, which is drawn largely from the soft left and aims to influence the direction of the party.\nSteered by the thinktank Compass, it is planning to mobilise a grassroots motion at party conference demanding the abolition of the two-child benefit cap, as well as aiming to campaign in constituency Labour parties and across the country for what they describe as bold but practical reforms.\nBurnham said he was concerned about the balance of the cabinet after the reshuffle and the deputy leadership contest was a moment to try to shift the party away from being London-centric. One of his preferred candidates, Haigh, who resigned last year over a scandal about a conviction for fraud over a missing mobile phone, is understood not to have made up her mind whether to run.\nHowever, there is likely to be a huge array of candidates battling for nominations as soon as the terms of the contest are decided by the national executive committee on Monday.\nThese could include David Lammy, Lisa Nandy and Shabana Mahmood in the cabinet; Haigh, Powell, Jess Phillips, Stella Creasy, Thornberry, Sarah Owen, Anneliese Dodds, Dawn Butler and Meg Hillier on the backbenches; plus Richard Burgon, Nadia Whittome and others more on the left of the party.\nMPs and their supporters are already frantically sounding out colleagues to see if their bids are viable. One MP tipped Phillips as gaining support, saying she was “an ideal successor to Angela [Rayner]. Brave, strong, principled, clear values, great communicator, sounds like a normal person.”\nThe party’s ruling national executive committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to outline a timetable for the deputy leadership election. Burgon, a former shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn, called on the committee “not to skew the process to deliver the outcome the current leadership wants but ensure this is a fully democratic process”. Butler also urged the party not to “shy away from a fair process when selecting our next deputy leader”."

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer is facing fresh pressure from Labour insiders, days after a sweeping government reshuffle, as party figures from the left and centre mobilise through a network, backed by Andy Burnham, designed to change Labour’s direction.\nThe network, called Mainstream, will inevitably influence Labour’s looming deputy leadership contest, with Burnham already throwing his weight behind former cabinet minister Louise Haigh as well as Lucy Powell, the former Commons leader.\nMainstream has been steered by Compass a centre-left thinktank, and Open Labour and is backed by Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor who when asked did not rule out the possibility of running in a future leadership contest with the network’s support.\nBut supporters include figures right across the party from Labour’s left to the centre, including Labour peers Alf Dubs and Anna Healy, Labour MPs Clive Lewis, Dawn Butler, Alex Sobel, Clive Efford, chair of the Tribune group of MPs, the former Blairite minister John Denham, and the founder of Momentum, Jon Lansman.\nBurnham told the Guardian: “Mainstream speaks to the change that’s needed, a more inclusive, less factional way of running the party. That is right anyway, but it’s really right for the times we’re in now.\n“We’ve got to get beyond this culture where everything’s a threat. If people are speaking out, it can actually be an opportunity to make changes.\n“Labour’s always been factional but it’s become more so in recent times than I can remember in almost 40 years in the party. You don’t win through a factional approach. You win through a broader approach.”\nIts founders say it is designed to be the “home for Labour’s radical realists”, promising to provide a space for members to discuss vision, policy and electoral strategy. They also aim to campaign in constituency Labour parties (CLPs) and across the country for what they describe as bold but practical reforms.\nAt the same time its Labour members are preparing to put a child poverty motion on the conference floor calling on the prime minister to scrap the two-child benefit limit, a policy blamed for pushing hundreds of thousands of children into poverty.\nThe conference motion, backed by Momentum, Open Labour and Compass, floats raising £6bn through levies on banks and the online gambling industry to pay for its abolition, an idea that has been supported by the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown.\nCompass’s decision to re-engage within Labour follows polling that has showed broad support for members who back wealth taxes, democratic reform and stronger action against child poverty.\nMainstream’s supporters believe the Labour government is struggling to communicate the coherent vision, policy and strategy needed to change the country. They acknowledge the huge electoral threat from the populist right in Reform UK and believe Starmer and his top team “seem lost and unprepared to develop and champion a popular left alternative”.\nThe network vows to become openly campaigning, unlike other networks such as the Labour-aligned Fabian thinktank, seeking to get the support of members who feel the government has been too cautious.\nWith Angela Rayner forced to resign after being found in breach of the ministerial code, Labour faces a deputy leadership contest. Burnham said it should not be “a running commentary on the government” but a debate about “the running of the party”.\nHe suggested Haigh and Powell as figures who “represent the centre of gravity” of Labour: “I think it’s really important that people from all parts of the party are involved, but particularly those who are the heart of it all.”\nBurnham has long been viewed as a possible successor to Starmer. Asked if Mainstream could become a vehicle for him to return to Westminster, he replied: “It’s about culture rather than people … it’s bigger than any one personality.”\nPressed again, he said: “I’m really happy where I am. I think what we’ve done through devolution is connect people with politics in a different way. This is intended to help the government … it’s tough being in government and Mainstream is here to help them.”\nOrganisers say its not a faction or a caucus, but a broad church of the party’s progressive left, stretching from the soft left through to non-aligned activists who would class themselves as centrists.\nLabour figures say it would not be surprising for an organisation set up in this way to seek to propose its own candidate for the party’s upcoming deputy leadership contest, and even shape the ground for a future leadership contest.\nWhile Starmer’s reshuffle indicated his plans to tighten his grip on his ministerial team with a focus on tackling immigration and taking on the fight to Reform UK, his party management will be tested at conference.\nMainstream organisers believe supporters are looking for a bolder offer from the government, to also avoid being outflanked by the Greens led by their new eco-populist leader Zack Polanski or the Corbyn-Sultana alliance.\nNeal Lawson, chair of Compass, said: “At this moment of peril for the party, Mainstream launches as a historic alliance in Labour. Never before have the centre, soft left and hard left come together to save its heart and soul.”"

    "raw_text": "Shabana Mahmood already showed she was willing to defy convention when she praised Margaret Thatcher for smashing a political mould – now she’s making history as the first Muslim woman to hold one of Britain’s great offices of state.\nIt’s not the new home secretary’s only moment as a surprising politician. Mahmood has spoken of how she has a “natural affinity for the faith, flag and family element of Blue Labour”, a small socially conservative fraction of the party which now holds some sway in No 10.\nShe has previously spoken about what it is like to live in an area where crime feels out of control. While she was growing up in Small Heath in inner-city Birmingham in the 1980s and 90s, her father kept a cricket bat behind the till of the family shop to fend off would-be robbers.\nHer views on community and social responsibility appear to be what have won her the job from Yvette Cooper, who has been doing years of hard work in the brief and was working on a new deportation deal with Germany to bring down small boat arrivals.\nMahmood is, however, a less cautious politician than Cooper, and appears to be more willing to express her opinions clearly. A source close to Mahmood told the Guardian this summer: “She really does feel like it’s an affront when people who come here are afforded the welcome that she and her family were, but break the laws of the land.”\nOn Sunday, she announced ministers would meet with the US and other members of the Five Eyes alliance in the coming week to announce measures to increase border security and target people smugglers.\nIn the same interview with the Spectator earlier this year in which she said Thatcher was her political hero, Mahmood said “there is still a moment of reckoning” on grooming gangs and questioned “why so many people looked the other way”.\nMahmood has proved her worth by delivering good politics and policy, having been Labour’s campaign coordinator in the election, and defusing several difficult situations in the justice department – from the prisons crisis to the review of sentencing.\nAs national campaign coordinator, she became indispensable to the strategy chief, Morgan McSweeney, and is credited for helping to secure the narrow but fateful win in the 2021 Batley and Spen byelection, without which Starmer would probably have faced a leadership challenge that summer.\nShe also showed herself willing to take a public position on a contentious issue when she rejected sentencing guidelines that advised judges to factor in the backgrounds of offenders as part of the sentencing process. Following that, she has taken on the power to veto new guidelines before they are issued to the judiciary.\nBefore entering parliament in 2010, Mahmood was educated at Oxford and was a barrister. One Downing Street insider suggested her legal knowledge would be crucial as the government looks into how the European convention on human rights is applied by judges to ensure the deportation of foreign criminals or those who have had their asylum applications refused. One MP has described her as the leader of those who believe: “If we need to break things, we should break things”.\nHowever, she will face enormous challenges – from the fact that every home secretary before her has struggled with the problem of small boat crossings to the deluge of anti-Muslim racism against her that is already evident on social media.\nOn top of small boats, she will soon have to take a decision on what to do about Cooper’s proscription of the Palestine Action campaign group as a terrorist organisation. She has also been a leading advocate for the UK to take a more pro-Palestinian stance, including on statehood, but she indicated on Sunday that she would not change course, saying : “Supporting Palestine and supporting a proscribed terrorist group are not the same thing.”\nWith Reform exploiting some of those tensions to claim that Britain’s social fabric is fraying, No 10 is placing huge faith in Mahmood to convey the message that the government cares about protecting communities and is prepared to address public frustration about immigration – without betraying its Labour values. That is likely to be the toughest job in government, apart from Starmer’s."

    "raw_text": "The Labour government needs a reset to become more decisive and listen more to its MPs, Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor and former cabinet minister, has said.\nBurnham, who is touted as a potential future leader, said he was concerned about the balance of the cabinet after the reshuffle and wanted the government to be more “pluralistic”.\nHe said the deputy leadership contest was a moment to try to improve the balance of the party, especially away from being London-centric.\nBurnham is unable to run because he is not an MP, but he suggested several figures from the “soft left” of the party including the former transport minister Louise Haigh, and the leader of the Commons Lucy Powell, who left her role in the reshuffle.\nThere is a huge list of other potential candidates, including David Lammy, Lisa Nandy and Shabana Mahmood in the cabinet; Stella Creasy, Emily Thornberry, Sarah Owen, Anneliese Dodds, Dawn Butler and Meg Hillier on the backbenches; plus Richard Burgon, Nadia Whittome and others more on the left of the party.\nThe party’s ruling national executive committee is scheduled to meet on Monday to outline a timetable for the deputy leadership election. Burgon, a former shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn, called on the committee “not to skew the process to deliver the outcome the current leadership wants but ensure this is a fully democratic process”.\nKeir Starmer’s shakeup of his team was triggered by the resignation of the deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, over her under-payment of stamp duty.\nHe appeared to seize the opportunity to cement allies in key jobs, including elevating Mahmood to home secretary and Pat McFadden to work and pensions secretary, and shifting David Lammy to be justice secretary and deputy prime minister.\nThe changes have been interpreted as an increase in power for the right of the party, with Mahmood charged with more radical solutions to the problem of small-boat crossings, and McFadden likely to have another attempt to finds ways to cut the welfare bill that MPs will not block.\nBurnham told the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg: “I am concerned about the balance, and I think you know, we need to use the deputy leadership contest to discuss some of these things.\n“In a time where the scale and the nature of the challenge we face is such as it is, you need everybody pulling together, all parts of the party pulling together. And that points to a party management style that is less factional and more pluralistic.\n“Labour MPs need to be, they need to listen to them more and respect them more. You know, they were the ones who, if you like, caused the change in terms of winter fuel and disability benefits. But you know, they shouldn’t be punished for that.\n“I think that’s what it needs, you know, we need to hear the voice of the party, the voice of the members, and then the voice of our communities behind that, particularly in the north of England, to counter that London centricity.”\nHe said there needed to be “a reset of the way we’re doing things” and that “if the government says it’s going to do something, it should just do it”, pointing to the slowness of progress on the Hillsborough law.\nThe reshuffle has prompted concern among some on the Labour left and the union movement that the government could row back on elements of its workers’ rights legislation which is making its way through parliament.\nJustin Madders, who lost his role as an employment minister spearheading the changes, posted on X on Sunday: “Let’s hope these fears are unfounded because it would be really, really foolish for the government to row back on key manifesto commitments that are popular with the public and will show what a positive difference a Labour government can make.”\nAsked whether the legislation would be watered down, the defence secretary, John Healey, told Sky: “No, I think the plan to upgrade what will be the biggest upgrade in workers’ rights for a generation, led by Angela Rayner as one of the marks of how effective she’s been as minister and what a loss she’ll be to government.”\nAsked whether that meant people could expect no changes to the legislation, he said: “I’m really confident that we’ll deliver what we promised in the manifesto, the biggest upgrade of workers’ rights for a generation. The bill’s been set out.”\nHe also said he disputed Burnham’s characterisation of the government as needing a reset to become more decisive and better at listening to MPs.\n“Our focus has been on the public that elected us, the delivery that we’re charged to change their lives. It’s a big part of the job we all do,” he said."

    "raw_text": "Shabana Mahmood is expected to unveil plans to move asylum seekers from hotels into military barracks as Labour seeks to harden its immigration policy amid rising numbers of crossings in the channel.\nThe new home secretary is reportedly set to announce the use of Ministry of Defence sites to house people after a wave of protests outside migrant accommodation over the summer.\nThe scale of the challenge facing the former justice secretary was illustrated on Saturday when an estimated 1,000 people arrived in the UK by small boats.\nDozens of asylum hotels are expected to close after they became the focal point of several demonstrations in recent months. Ministers are also close to agreeing a returns deal with Germany, having already secured one with France, the Daily Telegraph reported.\nOne government source said “nothing is off the table” for Mahmood as she assumes her new brief, which puts her in charge of borders and asylum policy. She has previously signalled a willingness to look at reform of the European convention of human rights within domestic law.\nIt comes after the prime minister carried out a major reshuffle including wide-ranging changes at the Home Office as he seeks to tighten his grip on immigration and draw a line under Angela Rayner’s resignation.\nThe chief secretary to the prime minister, Darren Jones, earlier denied that the government was in crisis and insisted Starmer now has the “strongest team” in place around the cabinet table following Rayner’s departure.\nHe ruled out the prospect of an early election amid opposition claims that the upheaval could open splits within Labour and collapse the prime minister’s authority.\nSpeaking to broadcasters on Saturday, Jones dismissed suggestions that the rejig could delay the Starmer’s self-described “phase two” of government by moving senior figures to unfamiliar briefs.\n“It’s not instability insofar as the outcomes that we’re delivering are the same,” Jones, who is also the newly appointed chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, told BBC Breakfast.\nHe rejected the idea Yvette Cooper had been moved out of the Home Office because she was failing to control immigration, adding she would be “brilliant” in her new role as the UK’s top diplomat."

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer has sought to tighten his grip on his government with a wave of junior ministerial changes that has sidelined allies of the unions, raising questions over the future of Labour’s workers’ rights package.\nThe reshuffle has been used by Downing Street to signal a tougher stance on immigration in an apparent bid to take on Reform UK, with Shabana Mahmood – a self-described social conservative rising star – now in charge of the Home Office, supported by Sarah Jones who returns to her former policing brief.\nJustin Madders, the employment rights minister, was one of the first on the junior benches to be sacked on Saturday. Despite being seen as one of the architects of Labour’s “new deal for working people”, Madders’ departure was not formally announced in No 10’s list of appointments. Instead, he revealed the news himself.\n“It has been a real privilege to serve as minister for employment rights and begin delivering on our plan to make work pay,” he said on X. “Sadly it is now time to pass the baton on – I wish my successor well & will do what I can to help them make sure the ERB is implemented as intended.”\nMadders’ removal, along with Rayner’s forced departure from her two government positions and post as Labour’s deputy leader, removes the key figures who helped design Labour’s employment rights bill – a policy unions praised as the government’s most ambitious commitment to workers’ rights in decades. However some within government have rowed back on this notion, insisting Starmer remains committed to the bill, describing it as good for business, workers and the economy – a central plan to make people better off.\nStarmer will also not attend this year’s TUC conference, a decision that has intensified concerns and rumours among unions and some inside Labour that the government is distancing itself. Rayner was the cabinet minister closest to the unions, and Madders had been given the job of turning the new deal into legislation.\nPeter Kyle, a close ally of Starmer, was promoted to lead the business department on Friday, meaning he will oversee the employment rights brief.\nAllies of Rayner who remain in government believe a fight is looming over workers’ rights. With Rayner and Madders gone, they believe Kyle has the ability to water down the bill – a package they feel many from the centre of the party were never comfortable with. The issue is likely to become factional, given polls show stronger employment protections remain popular with voters flirting with Reform UK.\nThe package had promised sweeping reforms including day one rights for workers, a ban on zero-hours contracts and stronger protects against fire-and-rehire. A union chief told the Guardian: “Rayner was the closest minister to the unions and her team have played an important role in pushing key parts of the employment rights bill through government.\n“The commitment to the bill is there from Keir so I’m less worried about that, but more worried about the broader sense of who actually understands the unions, and has the personal relationships.”\nEllie Reeves has been shifted from her role as party chair to solicitor general and will no longer attend cabinet. She has been replaced by Anna Turley. Georgia Gould, from Labour’s 2024 intake, has been promoted to education minister. Abena Oppong-Asare, meanwhile, has been appointed as one of Starmer’s parliament private secretaries – a key role linking with the parliamentary Labour party.\nIan Murray, who had been announced as leaving government on Friday night, has also made a comeback as a joint minister across the culture and science departments.\nFor Starmer, the cabinet reshuffle was about showing decisive leadership in the midst of a major crisis, to which as his chief secretary, Darren Jones, alluded. But this junior reshuffle for many shows a broader ideological return that sees the government more cemented under centrist control, and potential fights with the unions along the way.\nMeanwhile, the shake-up at the Home Office will be taken as a sign of strength by many within government. Mahmood, the new secretary of state, will lead a refreshed team that now includes Sarah Jones, a former shadow minister who has long wanted to return to the brief. As shadow policing minister, insiders have praised her for her work on pushing Labour’s agenda on knife crime, launching and chairing the APPG group that published investigations linking the issue to youth services and school exclusions.\nShe will be joined by Mike Tapp from Labour’s 2024 intake, who takes up a ministerial role in the Home Office. Tapp represents a Reform-facing seat and his promotion is being read as Starmer’s attempt to toughen up Labour’s image on crime and immigration. Louise Sandher-Jones, another 2024 MP, has also been appointed as a minister of defence, underlining a new generational shift Starmer is keen to showcase in his new team.\nDame Diana Johnson has been replaced by Sarah Jones and will now serve as a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, while Dan Jarvis will remain a minister in the Home Office and has also been made a Cabinet Office minister.\nJason Stockwood, the former chair of Grimsby Town football club, will take a seat in the House of Lords to become investment minister as part of Starmer’s ministerial shake-up. He was Labour’s candidate for Greater Lincolnshire mayor but was beaten by Reform’s Andrea Jenkyns.\nThe local government minister Jim McMahon has been sacked and will return to the backbenches, along with Maria Eagle, the defence minister. Catherine McKinnell resigned as minister of state for school standards, which included overseeing Send reform. She said she declined the opportunity to stay in government.\nDarren Jones dismissed the idea that Rayner’s departure could expose divisions within the Labour party, after Nigel Farage said “splits” will open."

    "raw_text": "It is the ultimate eyebrow-raising kitchen table confession in Celine Song’s romantic comedy-drama, Materialists.\nAfter matchmaker Lucy (Dakota Johnson) grows suspicious of scars on her new partner’s body, financier Harry (Pedro Pascal) makes a startling admission: he has had leg-lengthening surgery – and gained six inches in height.\nThe couple split soon after. But amid a wave of interest in the cosmetic procedure and clinics in Turkey offering discounts, the NHS in England has issued a stark warning, urging people against it.\nThe surgery involves breaking the bones in the legs before pulling them apart to lengthen them over weeks or months.\nInvented by the Soviet surgeon Gavriil Abramovich Ilizarov in the 1950s, it was used to treat patients with clinical needs, but is now offered privately for cosmetic purposes.\nChina’s health ministry banned cosmetic leg lengthening in 2006, over fears about the risks to patients, but the practice is booming elsewhere. The global limb-lengthening industry will be worth $8.6bn (£6.4bn) by 2030, according to estimates.\nPrivate treatment in the UK can cost more than £50,000, with some surgeons charging £240,000. Clinics in Turkey offer the procedure for £24,000.\nLimb-lengthening surgery involves two main steps. A surgeon performs an osteotomy, cutting the bone into two segments, and then attaches a limb lengthening device to the two segments. The device comprises a thin metal frame and is attached to the bones with pins or wires. Most of the device is outside the body, making it hard to wear certain clothes. Newer options involve a screw-like device placed inside the bone.\nPatients face a period of recovery and cannot walk for several weeks. Next, they begin adjusting their leg-lengthening device several times a day for several months. Each adjustment separates the bone segments a small amount. As the bones separate, the body creates new bone to fill the gap between them.\nHowever, if not done carefully, the risks are high. Bones separated too quickly will not mend or will grow together with tissue too fragile to bear the body’s weight.\nSome legs can end up being different lengths. Patients also risk infection, nerve damage and permanent disability.\nProf Tim Briggs, an orthopaedic surgeon and NHS England’s national director for clinical improvement and elective recovery, said leg lengthening surgery was “not a quick fix”.\n“It is a serious, invasive procedure that can be beneficial for patients when there is a genuine clinical need but carries significant risks and requires informed discussions between patient and surgeon.\n“Patients face months of treatment, which can be extremely painful, with the possibility of infection, nerve damage, blood clots and even permanent disability.\n“Anyone considering this surgery for cosmetic reasons abroad, should think very carefully about the long recovery and the risks, and I would urge against it unless well informed about where they are seeking treatment.\n“Don’t gamble with your health or your life for a few extra inches without fully understanding the risks.”"

    "raw_text": "It was on his honeymoon in Kuala Lumpur, looking out of his hotel window at the silvery points of the world’s tallest twin skyscrapers, that Frank decided it was time to become taller. He had recently confessed to his new wife how much his height had bothered him since he was a teenager. As a man dedicated to self-improvement, Frank wanted to take action. He picked up the phone, called a clinic in Turkey that specialises in leg lengthening surgery – and made a booking.\n“I had a lot of second thoughts – at the end of the day, someone’s going to break your legs,” he says, propped up on a hotel bed in Istanbul, his legs splayed in front of him, bracketed by a brace on each thigh. His wife, Emilia, tends to him, fetching painkillers and ice packs for the wound sites where the braces puncture his legs. For the first two weeks after surgery, Frank needed her help to get on and off the toilet, but now, six weeks later, it’s largely only to get off the bed.\nThe bleep of an alarm interrupts our conversation: time to insert a key into the metal bracket on the side of Frank’s thigh and turn it, forcing apart the rods that have been inserted into his femurs. New bone grows into the gap in his thigh bones, one agonising millimetre at time. Each turn of the key dictates how much the patient can grow, and Frank is aiming for five turns each day rather than the four recommended by his doctors, to gain a precious extra quarter of a centimetre. It means more suffering, but Frank is all about putting in the work to get what he wants. “Time to grow!” Emilia says, with a little laugh, as the alarm sounds.\nAt 5ft 6in (1.7m) tall, slightly under the average male height worldwide, Frank, 38, feels he has lived life “as a short man”. But speak with any patient at the Wanna Be Taller clinic in Istanbul, where Frank chose to undergo leg lengthening, and it becomes clear that shortness is relative. Men over 6ft have had the procedure. One tells me he needed surgery to “correct” his bow legs and decided to add some height at the same time. A slim blond woman – a rare example of a female patient here – who was 5ft 3in before surgery, looks me square in the eyes as she deadpans that shortness “is the last acceptable prejudice in society” to explain why she underwent the procedure to gain two inches. (The clinic also offers leg shortening surgery, though this is far less common; only nine patients have so far had it done, mainly women.)\nFrank, meanwhile, is determined to become taller than Emilia – who is 5ft 5in – by gaining 9cm, just above the 8.5cm doctors told him is the maximum his muscles and tendons can safely handle. This would make him 5ft 9in. His dream is simple: being average height.\nFive turns of the key daily means he stands to gain just over a millimetre a day for 10 weeks. It’s not without its challenges: “Sometimes the nerve pain wrecks me.” Frank prides himself on being a self-starter: he has the words “self made” tattooed across his knuckles and a likeness of his hero, Arnold Schwarzenegger – in his view, the ultimate self-made man – on his thigh. Arnie’s face is slowly being stretched as Frank grows. “I’m making my own height, choosing how tall I want to be,” he says. “I am very ambitious: if I want something, I go for it. Until I do it, it almost torments me.”\nTo the casual observer, leg lengthening looks like a form of medieval torture, and earlier that day I watched as a physiotherapist gently lifted each of Frank’s new legs while he groaned with pain – straightening his hamstrings feels impossible, as if they might snap. He is in recovery from the first of two surgeries: this one broke his femurs to insert metal rods and add fixators. The second will remove the fixators after he has completed the key-turning process, in three months’ time. Some patients choose to have their shin bones broken instead, or in addition, in a bid to be even taller.\nIf having your leg bones cut in half sounds painful enough, the true agony comes afterwards. Ensconced on the periphery of Istanbul, in a hotel built from what looks like plasterboard and fake gold leaf, about 20 leg lengthening patients spend their days obsessing over their muscles and tendons, making sure they stretch to accommodate their new bones. This means daily physiotherapy to learn how to walk again, blood thinners, massages and a lot of painkillers. While there are few global statistics on the number of people opting to have this done each year, one Indian market research firm estimated the global limb lengthening industry will balloon by 2030 to be worth $8.6bn (£6.4bn).\n“I always tell them, 1cm is not more important than your health,” says Serkan Aksoy from Wanna Be Taller, who supervises Frank’s physio. Most of their patients are men, and Aksoy has to dissuade many clients from trying to gain too much height. From the clinic’s perspective, the risks come from patients not adhering to a strict aftercare routine, but problems and even deaths do occur. Blood clots, joint issues, failure to grow new bone tissue, blood vessel injuries, scarring and chronic pain are all potential complications, as well as “ballerina syndrome”, where the achilles tendons fail to stretch adequately, forcing the feet into an exaggerated arch and preventing the patient from walking. Last year, a patient who had flown in from Saudi Arabia died from a blood clot 16 days after undergoing leg lengthening surgery. When I ask Wanna Be Taller about this, they say an investigation by the Saudi authorities found no fault with their surgeon.\nEven though Frank chose a cheaper option, involving external fixators rather than an electronic internal device, the $32,000 (£24,000) price tag – including months in a hotel and physiotherapy – has put a major dent in the funds the newlyweds had planned to use as downpayment for a mortgage. When I ask about this, Emilia describes how months of travel across Asia gave them a new perspective. The couple began to think they were placing too much importance on material things rather than aiming for true contentment. “Having food, a comfortable bed – that’s real happiness,” Emilia says. “After that, if it’s buying a house, we’ll go for it. And if it’s breaking your legs and being tall, go for it.”\nThe idea that breaking bones can provide a way to shorten or lengthen a limb is widely attributed to the Soviet surgeon Gavriil Abramovich Ilizarov, who developed the “Ilizarov technique” in Russia in 1951. This involved adding external metal rings around a broken bone to stabilise it, held in place by metal pins or wires. If the patient wishes to grow, the frame can be used to draw sections away from one another; Ilizarov found new bone grows between them, adding length. His technique has since been adopted globally.\nWhile more sophisticated techniques are now common, the principle remains. Today, leg lengthening is even available on the NHS at a specialised clinic within the Royal National Orthopaedic hospital. Even so, a spokesperson for the RNOH’s limb reconstruction unit tells me the 100 or so patients they treat annually are there to recover from injury or correct deformities – and patients lengthening both legs are rare.\nThe same spokesperson lists their concerns about patients going overseas for “a procedure with significant risks and an arduous physical therapy requirement”. These include clinics downplaying the dangers while overplaying “the cosmetic benefits”, and a lack of proper aftercare. The NHS routinely treats patients with problems after surgery abroad, and a study conducted by the RNOH “revealed a significant cost burden to the NHS” for treating botched cosmetic leg lengthening.\nChina’s health ministry banned cosmetic leg lengthening in 2006, fearing the dangers to patients in a growing and unregulated industry, but the practice has persisted elsewhere. Private treatment in the UK can cost upwards of £50,000, with some surgeons charging £240,000 to lengthen two bones in each leg. What makes a growing number fly to Turkey from as far afield as Australia or Japan is lower prices.\nFrank can reel off a list of negative experiences stretching back into adolescence that he believes stemmed from his height. There was the pain of his friends suddenly becoming taller than him after he stopped growing around the age of 15. There were the kids at school who taunted him for his height; a longtime online fan of his artwork who remarked, on meeting him, that Frank was “shorter than I expected”; or the guys who randomly shoved him in the street a few years ago, tearing out his headphones. They wouldn’t have done that to a taller man, he reasons. In Frank’s view, tall people don’t realise their privilege. “It’s hard to explain if you’re not a short man yourself, but in modern society it’s almost a curse,” he says, as he carefully keeps watch over his pain medication and blood thinners.\nThen, of course, there were all the stinging dating experiences before he met Emilia, such as the woman 6in smaller who showed up for coffee and immediately said he was too short for her. Experiences like this, he says, are standard for his short male friends. The dating app Tinder even recently trialled a feature that lets paying users set a height preference. “Even tall men are having problems now,” he says. “The new fashion is 6ft 4in, otherwise you’re a piece of shit.” All of this wore Frank down before he stumbled across a YouTube video a few years ago, showing leg lengthening surgery.\nOur conversation inevitably drifts towards issues of masculinity. A recent study showed that young men in the UK now outspend women on minimally invasive “tweakments” such as Botox injections – which some practitioners now jokingly refer to as “Brotox”. Then there’s the growth of the so-called “manosphere”, which deifies the ripped torso of Joe Rogan or Photoshops Donald Trump on to a picture of a bodybuilder. Surely when we’re talking about male height, we’re really talking about masculinity – and power? Frank bats it away: he doesn’t have any time for those toxic alpha male types. “This surgery isn’t about that – I don’t think it’s about being more masculine, it’s about being average height,” he says.\nNot long after our conversation, Frank woke up one night in “some of the worst pain I’ve ever felt”. He tried to scream while struggling to breathe, but the four huge ice packs on his legs did little to dull the pain. After clinicians rushed him to a nearby hospital, he was treated for a pulmonary embolism – a blood clot that travelled into the arteries of the lung. A representative from Wanna Be Taller later tells me Frank and the Saudi Arabian patient are the only two of their 700 clients who have experienced a blood clot following surgery. Frank, it turns out, needed a higher dose of blood thinners. But while a blood clot is a rare side-effect, the fate of the Saudi patient shows that it can be fatal.\nEven from his hospital bed, in agonising pain, Frank had continued to turn the key on his fixators. But after speaking with his doctor, it turned out his nerves and tendons had been stretched to their limit – he was unable to straighten his legs. It was time to remove the fixators early, cutting off his growth. He had grown 7.3cm, putting him just under his 5ft 9in goal.\nFrank is determined he won’t be treating shorter men any differently now, but one interaction with another patient has stayed with him. “I saw him as a short man for the first time. Not in a bad way, but I saw why people perceived me as a short man – and I felt tall compared with him. Now, every time a woman comes near me, they’re shorter,” he says, with undisguised glee.\n“It’s worth it at the end, if you see the difference between me and her,” he says, pointing at Emilia.\nSome names have been changed."

    "raw_text": "The organisers of the Great North Run have apologised after finisher T-shirts and medals were printed with a map of rival north-east city Sunderland instead of Newcastle.\nAbout 60,000 people took part in the half marathon on Sunday, running 13.1 miles from the centre of Newcastle, across the River Tyne, and through Gateshead, finishing by the coast in South Shields.\nAfter receiving their finishers’ merchandise, runners noticed that the river on their T-shirts and medals matched the shape of the north-east’s other famous river and not Newcastle’s Tyne.\nWhile the map on the medal has been printed with the words “Newcastle”, “Gateshead”, and “South Shields”, they appear to have been overlaid on to a map of Sunderland’s streets, shown either side of the River Wear.\nThe race’s blue finisher T-shirt also has the same outline in the shape of the Wear, at the centre of a more abstract map made up of words related to the run.\nEagle-eyed runners spotted what appears to be the Stadium of Light on the medal – the home of Newcastle’s arch footballing rivals, Sunderland AFC.\n“Thought it was a joke, but just checked and the map on the medal is actually of Sunderland,” one Sunderland fan wrote on X.\n“Beautiful as it is, I can’t help but think this year’s Great North Run medal would be more appropriate with a map of Tyneside on it, rather than the streets of Wearside and the Stadium of Light,” Michael Bailey, a photographer, said on X.\nThe medal design even sparked rumours that it may be a hidden clue signifying a future change of route for the race. “Wear sorry!” a spokesperson for the Great North Run said. “As the eagle-eyed have already spotted, the shape of the river on this year’s finisher T-shirt and medal is indeed the River Wear.\n“To answer the rumours that this was the route reveal for next year … sorry to disappoint, it’s a mistake. Lots of people looked very closely at the designs and none of us picked it up.”\nThey added: “We had Newcastle United stars on the start line and the Stadium of Light on the medal. The Great North Run is truly a celebration of the region, even more so than we had planned. For the 60,000 who ran yesterday, you’ve got the most unique T-shirt and medal in Great North Run history, a keepsake that we’ll be talking about in 44 years’ time.”\nThe race’s founder, Sir Brendan Foster, said: “I loved the designs for the medal and T-shirt, spent ages marvelling at them, and never spotted the mistake, even when we hung it in Fenwick’s window. I’ve lived on the River Tyne my whole life and I should’ve noticed, but if I’d run the Great North Run yesterday, I’d still be wearing my medal with pride.”\nHe added: “Thanks to everyone who took part in an amazing event yesterday, and all the supporters who came out to cheer on the runners. It was a fantastic Great North Run, and we’re already looking forward to 2026, after we’ve brushed up on our geography.”"

    "raw_text": "The organisers of the Great North Run have apologised for using a map of Sunderland, rather than Newcastle, on this year’s finisher medals, but this was just one in a long line of map mistakes.\nOther blunders have included phantom supermarkets, dangerously misleading mountaineering routes and geopolitical blunders.\nThe phantom Aldi\nEarlier this year the Welsh village of Cyffylliog in Denbighshire was beset by an unexpected stream of traffic after an Aldi supermarket appeared on a map.\nThe name of a farm just below the village, home to about 500 people, was changed on Google Maps to the name of the supermarket, leading to an influx of people attempting to do a weekly shop, and a milk tanker getting stuck.\nGoogle said it “worked around the clock” to identify suspicious behaviour, and corrected the listing.\nA geopolitical blunder\nIn December, Fifa said it sincerely regretted an error that failed to include Crimea as part of Ukraine.\nThe map, which showed countries that could not be drawn to play each other for political reasons, did not include the region that has been occupied by Russia since 2014 but is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.\n“We fully understand the delicate sensitivity of this matter and while the incident was unintentional, we sincerely regret any concern it may have caused,” the association said in a letter to the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF) general secretary, Igor Gryshchenko.\nBen Nevis danger route\nIn 2021, Google Maps updated its routes on Ben Nevis, the UK’s highest mountain, after being warned that the existing paths shown were “potentially fatal”.\nThe Scottish mountaineering charity John Muir Trust warned that the directions given on the map to the car park closest to the summit risked leading inexperienced walkers to a route that was “highly dangerous, even for experienced climbers” as it was steep and rocky and with no distinct path.\nGoogle said the issue related only to driving directions, and not walking directions, adding that these did not lead people to dangerous routes, but the map was updated to direct motorists to a visitor centre instead.\nMarathon mishaps\nAt last year’s San Francisco half marathon, the course turned out to be half a mile too short, invalidating the times of thousands of runners.\nOrganisers said the course route had been measured correctly, but the certification map had been drawn incorrectly, leading to the error.\nIt was not the first time a race route has turned out to be the wrong length: for three years, between 2013 and 2015, the Greater Manchester Marathon was incorrectly mapped and measured at 380 metres too short. As a result, the times of approximately 24,000 runners from these years were declared invalid by UK Athletics.\nSimilar errors have affected other races in the past, including the Brighton Half Marathon and the Great Scottish Run.\nSteps too far\nGoogle fixed an error on its Edinburgh map after motorists were mistakenly directed to drive down a set of steps. The route was previously accessible to cars but the road was changed, with a set of steps installed. At least two cars became stuck on the staircase off Leith Walk at the foot of Calton Hill. In January, Google said it had fixed the map after being made aware of the issue."

    "raw_text": "Amazon has fired more than 150 unionized drivers working for a third-party contractor in Queens, New York, according to the Teamsters union.\nWorkers rallied at the company’s DBK4 facility in Queens on Monday after the company fired the drivers, who worked for Cornucopia, a delivery service provider (DSP) that Amazon contracted with to make deliveries. Amazon works with more than 3,000 DSPs around the world who deliver the company’s packages.\nThe Teamsters said the firings were in retaliation for unionizing.\n“Amazon is breaking the law and we let the public know it,” said Antonio Rosario, a member of local 804 and a Teamster organizer, in a statement. “Amazon workers will continue to organize and fight for what they deserve.”\nIn a statement, Amazon said the union was “deliberately spreading misinformation”.\nAmazon has long claimed that drivers who are employed by third-party contractors are not employees of the company, and that firing a contractor does not amount to retaliation for unionizing.\nIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson, Eileen Hards, called the move “a recent change we made that’s designed to allow DSPs to be more hands-on with their teams and support their operations at one delivery station”.\n“Our goal is to provide customers with fast delivery and great service – and we regularly review and make changes to the DSP program in support of this,” Hards said. “Changes like this not only benefit their employees, but also our customers.”\nLast August, a National Labor Relations Board official in Los Angeles ruled that Amazon had engaged in unfair labor practices after it terminated its contract with Battle-Tested Strategies (BTS), another DSP based in Palmdale, California, whose drivers had unionized with the Teamsters.\nAlthough the NLRB said that Amazon’s action did not amount to retaliation, the official said Amazon and BTS “unlawfully failed and refused to bargain with the union over effects of the decision to terminate the BTS contract”.\nIn its ruling, the NLRB deemed Amazon a joint employer of the drivers. Amazon has appealed against the ruling.\nIn the weeks leading up to Christmas, the Teamsters organized a strike among Amazon warehouse workers across eight facilities over what the union says were stalled contract negotiations for better pay and working conditions.\nLast September, Amazon joined companies including SpaceX that argued the structure of the NLRB is unconstitutional because its board members cannot be removed by the president. Though a ruling on the case has not been issued, the supreme court stayed Donald Trump’s firing of Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the NLRB, despite being blocked by a lower court.\nSince Wilcox’s position remains unfilled, the labor board does not have a quorum to rule on labor disputes, meaning it’s unable to rule on major labor disputes."

    "raw_text": "With Christmas less than a week away, thousands of Amazon warehouse workers across the countries are on strike after the company refused to start contract negotiations with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\nThough it’s been well over two years since the first Amazon warehouse union was formed in New York City, and workers at several other warehouses across the country have started to unionize, the company has refused to recognize and negotiate a contract with the union.\nThe Teamsters gave Amazon a 15 December deadline to come to the bargaining table, which the company refused to acknowledge.\nHere’s what you need to know about the Amazon warehouse strike.\nWhich Amazon workers are striking?\nAmazon employs more than 1.5 million people around the world. The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) has gained about 10,000 workers across 10 facilities in the US over the last two years. In June, the ALU voted to affiliate with the Teamsters, which has 1.3 million union members across the country.\nThe Teamsters said that seven of the 10 facilities with unions are on strike. The warehouses include one in the borough of Queens in New York, one in Atlanta, three in southern California, one in San Francisco and a seventh in a Chicago suburb. The Teamsters said that Amazon Teamsters at other facilities “are prepared to join them”.\nThe union says the strike is the largest against Amazon in the company’s history.\nHow will the strike affect deliveries?\nIt’s unclear how the strike will affect operations. Amazon has hundreds of thousands of employees still working at delivery hubs and facilities that aren’t unionized.\nThe company said it does not anticipate the strike affecting its operations heading into Christmas.\nBut the Teamsters president, Sean O’Brien, said in a statement on Thursday morning that if Amazon customers have package delays, “you can blame Amazon’s insatiable greed”.\n“We gave Amazon a clear deadline to come to the table and do right by our members. They ignored it,” he said. “These greedy executives had every chance to show decency and respect for the people who make their obscene profits possible. Instead, they’ve pushed workers to the limit and now they’re paying the price. The strike is on them.”\nThe Teamsters said its local unions will also put up picket lines at hundreds of other non-unionized Amazon fulfillment centers across the country.\nHow long will the strike last?\nThe Teamsters has not specified how long the strike will last, meaning it could go on past Christmas and into the new year.\nWhy are Amazon workers striking?\nThough thousands of its employees have voted to unionize, the company has staunchly opposed efforts to increase union membership and has refused to recognize some employees as Amazon workers.\nThe union wants Amazon to negotiate a contract with its members, who are demanding better wages, job security and benefits.\nAmazon warehouse workers and delivery drivers have long reported conditions that can be taxing on workers. A report from a US Senate committee, led by the Democratic senator Bernie Sanders, released this week accused Amazon of putting workers under heavy quotas that risk their safety. The committee said that Amazon warehouses recorded 30% more injuries at its warehouses over the industry average. Amazon has said that the report is “fundamentally flawed”.\nWhy won’t Amazon negotiate with the union?\nSome Amazon Teamster members are delivery drivers who work for third-party companies, called “delivery service partners”, who drive vans with Amazon logos but are technically not employed by the company.\nEarlier this year, two regional directors with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued initial complaints that said Amazon is technically a joint employer of the drivers, even if they are hired by third parties. The hearing over an NLRB complaint in southern California is scheduled for March.\nIn September, Amazon filed its own complaint challenging the structure of the NLRB, arguing that it is unconstitutional because board members cannot be removed by the president. Though the company, along with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which filed a similar suit, argued in front of a panel of judges from the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit in November, the court has yet to issue a ruling.\nThat’s all to say that Amazon’s resistance to recognizing the union is still tied up in court, and the company maintains that many of the unionized members are not its employees and that the union harasses and intimidates employees.\n“For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public – claiming that they represent ‘thousands of Amazon employees and drivers’. They don’t, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement."

    "raw_text": "An appeals court has paved the way for a likely showdown in the US supreme court over presidential power after reinstating two federal agency heads fired from their posts in Donald Trump’s all-out assault on the government bureaucracy.\nThe Washington DC court of appeals ordered that Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox be restored to the positions with the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) respectively. The ruling overturned a previous verdict by a three-judge panel which had ruled that their dismissals – which had been earlier overturned under legal challenge – were indeed legal.\nIt is the latest twist in the legal status of the two officials, but unlikely to be the last.\nMonday’s ruling by the full court was along party lines, with seven judges appointed by Democratic presidents voting to reinstate the women against four dissenters, who were all appointed to the bench by Republican administrations.\nThe Trump administration is not expected to accept the latest ruling, but is instead likely to ask the supreme court to rule on the constitutional basis of a 90-year-old legal precedent on which it is based.\nHarris and Wilcox have been repeatedly fired and reinstated since Trump’s inauguration following contradictory rulings.\nBoth have alleged that their unceremonious firings breach an existing 1978 law which says that agency members can only be dismissed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office”. Neither was given a reason why they were being terminated.\nWilcox became the first Black woman on the NLRB after being confirmed by the Senate following her nomination by Joe Biden in 2021. She was reconfirmed after being nominated to a second term in 2023.\nHarris is head of a previously obscure agency whose power to review and reverse federal employee firings has now assumed central relevance in light of the mass dismissals of federal workers and government watchdogs carried out since Trump took office.\nShe was initially reinstated on 4 March following the ruling of a district court judge, Rudolph Contreras, who wrote that Trump’s firing of her a month earlier was unlawful because he cited no cause.\nAlthough subsequent rulings later confirmed the initial firings, the appeals court justified its judgment with reference to a 1935 supreme court ruling, which protects the heads of independent agencies from being removed by a president.\n“The supreme court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant supreme court precedent unless and until that court itself changes it or overturns it,” the appeals court’s ruling stated.\nSome Trump administration officials have said the 90-year-old ruling is unconstitutional and have said the supreme court should overturn it. Some of the court’s conservative-leaning justices have indicated a readiness to do so.\nA minority dissenting opinion on Tuesday’s ruling, written by Karen Henderson – appointed under George HW Bush – said the supreme court should be asked to rule. “Only the supreme court can decide the dispute and, in my opinion, the sooner, the better,” she wrote."

    "raw_text": "Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) under the Biden administration, was one of the first officials to be fired by Donald Trump once he took office in January. She wasn’t the last.\nSince then, Trump has fired a slew of government officials, including the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) chair, Gwynne Wilcox, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, and most recently, he has attempted to fire the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.\nAbruzzo served at the agency for nearly 30 years before Trump fired her in January 2025, a move recommended in Project 2025. Now she is warning that the attacks on the US’s top labor watchdog threaten to return workers’ rights to levels unseen since 1935 and empower corporations to run roughshod over the agency.\n“My fear is that if this continues, where corporations and corporate billionaire donors have an outsized voice and directly influence our democracy, we’re going to find ourselves living in an environment such as what we lived in before 1935 when the National Labor Relations Act was enacted,” said Abruzzo. “Working families will be dealing with lower wages, substandard working conditions, and no real channels for them to fight back.”\nIn May, the supreme court declined to reinstate Wilcox while she challenges Trump’s decision to terminate her without cause. A lower court will now have to rule on the issue, with the supreme court likely to follow on appeal. In the meantime, the agency’s powers have been effectively blocked and, Abruzzo worries, worse may be to come.\nThe move was seen by opponents as a challenge to a landmark 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v United States, that ruled Congress can limit the president’s power to remove officials from independent administrative agencies.\nAbruzzo worries that Wilcox’s firing could pave the way for the National Labor Relations Act, enacted in 1935 to federally protect workers’ rights to organize and engage in collective bargaining, to be repealed entirely.\n“If the supreme court majority eliminates or limits the reach of Humphrey’s Executor and allows the president to fire decision-making officials in the executive branch, including at the NLRB, at his whim, then I anticipate the next step will be figuring out whether or not, if they are found unconstitutional, those provisions should be severed, or the whole [NLRA] act could conceivably be repealed,” Abruzzo said.\nIn the meantime, Abruzzo argues, the NLRB has been rendered toothless.\n“It’s going to take years to sort out, the agency’s going to be completely ineffective in enforcing the statute, and working families are going to continue to suffer and not be able to get any redress for the violations of their rights. It’s why I think states need to step in and protect their citizenry.”\nMajor corporations are already making ground against the agency after the ruling. On 19 August, the US court of appeals fifth circuit ruled preliminary injunctions halting unfair labor practice cases against Elon Musk’s SpaceX and two other employers can remain in place as the employers’ challenge the constitutionality of the NLRB.\nThe NLRB declined to comment. SpaceX did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n“I think we’re going to see a flood of employers forum shopping and flocking into district courts in the fifth circuit area seeking to get preliminary injunctions preventing the NLRB cases that frankly are seeking to hold corporations accountable for their law breaking from moving forward, and that’s going to put an end to the NLRB being able to enforce the act in any meaningful way,” said Abruzzo. “This is all about elevating corporate interests above workers’ rights.”\nThe firings have also left the NLRB without a quorum throughout most of the Trump administration, rendering it unable to issue decisions on cases.\nIn January 2025, after Trump fired Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve as chair of the NLRB board. Trump nominated two members to the board. They are awaiting a vote in the Senate for confirmation, while the term of one of two remaining board members, Marvin Kaplan, expired on 27 August.\nThe agency has also proposed a 4.7% budget cut of $14m for fiscal year 2026, after noting the agency expects to lose nearly 10% of its staff to voluntary resignation and early retirements.\nThe acting general counsel of the NLRB argued earlier this month that the board “has largely been unaffected” by the lack of quorum. But since Trump took office, the NLRB has only issued six decisions compared with fiscal year 2024, when the board issued 259 decisions.\n“Unless an employer is willing to go along with what the board says, the employer can stall a case indefinitely right now,” said Lauren McFerran, who served as chair of the NLRB during the Biden administration and as a board member from December 2014 to December 2019 and again in July 2020 to January 2021.\n“So whether it’s a [union] election case, whether it’s an unfair labor practice case, the minute the employer says that they’re not willing to go along and that they want to raise an objection to the board, you’re stuck for the foreseeable future at this point,” added McFerran.\nAbruzzo argues the firing of Wilcox by Trump, if allowed to stand by the courts, would eliminate the independence of the NLRB in favor of corporations. It’s up to the public to push back on these trends of stripping away protections for workers at the behest of wealthy, powerful corporations and billionaires like Musk, she said.\n“There is strength in numbers, and we all need to remember we matter. We make an impact on each other’s lives each and every day, and we can’t let the voice of corporate billionaires drown out our voices or squelch our actions and our spirit,” said Abruzzo.\n“We’re not powerless, and we have the power to demand changes to the way we’re governed, to the way we live our lives. That includes taking to the streets, frankly, and protesting over inadequate wages and working conditions and over economic, social and racial injustice. We need to do more in amplifying our voices, to make sure we’re heard and that actions are taken that are going to benefit us, because that’s, in my opinion, how the tactic of divide and conquer is going to be vanquished.”"

    "raw_text": "A French anaesthetist accused of intentionally poisoning 30 child and adult patients between the ages of four and 89, 12 of whom died, has gone on trial in the city where he worked.\nFrédéric Péchier, 53, worked at two clinics in the eastern city of Besançon when patients went into cardiac arrest in suspicious circumstances between 2008 and 2017. Twelve could not be resuscitated.\nPéchier, who had previously been considered by some colleagues as a “star anaesthetist”, is accused of triggering heart attacks in patients so he could show off his resuscitation skills and discredit co-workers.\nPéchier’s youngest alleged victim, a four-year-old identified as Teddy, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil operation in 2016. The doctor’s oldest alleged victim was 89.\nThe trial, which began on Monday, follows an eight-year investigation that stunned the medical community. Péchier has denied the charges.\nPéchier was greeted on his arrival at the court by several of his relatives, including one who shouted: “Come on, Frédo.”\nEarlier, Péchier had told the broadcaster RTL he had “strong arguments” in his defence. “It’s necessary to lay all the cards on the table,” he said.\nAsked about the suffering of the families who will attend the trial, set to last until December, Péchier replied: “I understand it completely, but on the other hand, I am not responsible for their distress.”\nPéchier faces life imprisonment if convicted. He is not currently in custody but under judicial supervision, an alternative to pre-trial detention.\nHe has not practised medicine since 2017, even though in 2023 he was authorised to work provided he did not come into contact with patients.\n“I’ve been waiting for this for 17 years,” said Amandine Iehlen, whose 53-year-old father died of cardiac arrest during kidney surgery in 2008. An autopsy revealed an overdose of lidocaine, a local anaesthetic.\nThe prosecutor Étienne Manteaux has said the case is “unprecedented in French legal history”.\nAn investigation was opened in 2017 after suspicious cardiac arrests during operations on patients considered low risk.\nPéchier is suspected of tampering with his colleagues’ paracetamol bags or anaesthesia pouches to create operating room emergencies where he could intervene to show off his resuscitating talents.\n“What he is accused of is poisoning healthy patients in order to harm colleagues with whom he was in conflict,” Manteaux said.\n“Frédéric Péchier was the first responder when cardiac arrest occurred,” he added. “He always had a solution.”\nPechier has blamed “medical errors” by his colleagues for most of the poisonings.\nOver the course of the inquiry, investigators examined more than 70 reports of “serious adverse events”, medical jargon for unexpected complications or deaths among patients.\nThe cases of 30 patients who suffered cardiac arrest during surgery at the Saint-Vincent clinic and the Franche-Comté polyclinic made it to trial.\nPéchier’s defence team will argue for acquittal. “It’s very easy to accuse people, it’s harder to prove things,” one of his lawyers, Randall Schwerdorffer, told reporters.\nMore than 150 civil parties will be represented at the trial."

    "raw_text": "As the blitzing tempo and mosh pit violence of hardcore swept the US in the early-80s, San Francisco punks Flipper – whose frontman, Bruce Loose, died this weekend of a heart attack – assumed a provocative stance, choosing sarcastic nihilism over dumb machismo and swapping high-velocity thrash for menacing, slow-as-sludge post-punk jams. In an era of 7in singles packed with 30-second screeds, Flipper would draw their tunes out to 20-or-more minutes of grind, fielding spiteful comparisons to hated hippies the Grateful Dead as bassist and founder Will Shatter warned audiences, “the more you heckle us, the longer this song gets”.\nBut the true “culprit for any pissing off of audiences”, as drummer Steve DePace told Scene Point Blank in 2022, was Loose. Born Bruce Calderwood, in the late 70s Loose cashed in a life insurance policy his mother bought for him and spent the money on a bass guitar and amplifier. He soon joined an embryonic version of Flipper in 1979, assuming the nom-du-punk “Bruce Lose” (which he later switched for “Bruce Loose”, because he wanted to be “less negative”) and sharing bass and vocal duties with Shatter. The pair laid down heavy, industrial bass lines, while guitarist Tim Falconi, a Vietnam vet Loose later alleged had PTSD, fired off abrasive, trebly guitar lines.\nThere was, no question, a darkness to Flipper; Loose told the San Francisco Bay Guardian in 2005: “We saw a society that was going to hell, and we were either going to drag it all the way to hell, or drag it up out of hell.” But there was also a complexity to their lyrics beyond the rote misanthropy of their contemporaries. Ever, the black-hearted opening track to their 1982 debut Album – Generic Flipper, concluded with Loose ranting “Ever wish the human race didn’t exist? / And then realise you’re one, too?” while Life found Shatter reflecting, “I too have sung death’s praise / But I’m not going to sing that song any more … Life is the only thing worth living for.”\nIn concert, Flipper often fielded a pulverising version of nursery rhyme The Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, while their signature anthem, Sex Bomb – later covered by REM – was a grimy, joyful car crash of 50s rock’n’roll and punk, welding shredding saxophones and screaming theremin to eight minutes of rutting noise-rock and a repeated deranged refrain of “She’s a sex bomb my baby yeah!” On tour, the band would welcome local sax-players on stage to jam along with it; anarchy regularly ensued.\nA commendable second album, Gone Fishin’, followed in 1984, but the group split after Shatter died of a heroin overdose in 1987, only to re-form in 1990 after Rick Rubin signed them to his Def American label. The self-produced American Grafishy surfaced in 1993 by which time Flipper were being championed as an influence by groups such as Melvins, Jane’s Addiction and Nirvana, whose Kurt Cobain wore a homemade Flipper T-shirt on Saturday Night Live and in the video for Come as You Are. But Flipper never quite got to cash-in on the grunge moment: Loose was seriously injured in 1994 after rolling his truck off a country road and breaking his back.\nThere would be occasional reunions in the years that followed, most notably in the noughties, when Nirvana’s Krist Novoselic joined for their appearance at 2006’s Thurston Moore-curated All Tomorrows Parties: Nightmare B4 Christmas. It led to an unexpected fourth Flipper studio album, 2009’s Love. “Krist started rehearsing with us and just popped out an ad-libbed bass line, and we all went along with it, and we clicked,” Loose said. “We all realised we didn’t have to just be sitting back and doing the same old stuff, becoming a punk-rock revue type of band.”\nLoose would exit Flipper soon after, however. “I told [the other members] after the 2009 tour, I’m done,” he told Suburban Rebels, citing his many health issues, including his ongoing lower-back pain. Loose later said he had been “voted out” of the group by the other members, who hired Jesus Lizard frontman David Yow to take his place for shows between 2015 and 2022, while punk-rock lifer Mike Watt sang and played bass on their most recent tours.\nLoose, meanwhile, continued to battle his serious health issues, which he ascribed to “35 years of punk life. We ain’t got no health coverage, no retirement plan.” It was a lifestyle that had given his 66 years considerable meaning, however. As he confessed to the San Francisco Bay Guardian two decades ago, “For me, it was pertinent to be on the edge. Otherwise, I didn’t feel alive enough. It was a challenge to see how long you could live on the edge without dying.”"

    "raw_text": "At the end of June this year thousands of people – from Scotland to Bulgaria, Chile to Singapore – gathered in an industrial estate in Manchester to boot each other in the head. That wasn’t the express purpose, of course, but a common side-effect of attending Outbreak, the hardcore punk festival that has become a flagship event for a genre experiencing an unprecedented moment of mainstream visibility.\nBursting out of the American suburbs in the late 1970s, hardcore was a response to the punk and new wave invasion that had dominated the years prior. Early bands such as Black Flag, Bad Brains and Dead Kennedys distilled the rawness of punk and pushed it to extremes, pioneering a do-it-yourself ethos, and a fast, frantic sound that became the definitive sonic kickback to a decade of Reaganomics and rising conservatism. Though the sound of hardcore has evolved over the decades, spawning various subgenres (screamo, queercore, powerviolence) and acting as the jumping-off point for many of the pop-punk and emo bands that defined the 2000s, that grassroots philosophy has been unwavering. It’s there in the origins of Outbreak, too.\nFounded in 2011 by two guys in their mid-teens, purely because they were too young to get into local shows at 18+ venues, Outbreak began as a local DIY event for UK-based hardcore bands.\n“I didn’t have a clue what I was doing,” shrugs one of the organisers, who, in the spirit of collectivism that underpins the festival, asks not to be named. “I just really wanted to see these bands. So I thought: if I bring them all together in an all-ages venue, then I’ll get to see them. It was as simple as that.”\nThe inaugural Outbreak was an all-dayer held at a recreational hall in Sheffield. Since then, it has grown slowly and organically into a full weekend with an international bill and enough demand to fill Manchester’s 10,000 capacity Depot Mayfield – which it did in 2023. This year the festival returned to its 2022 home of Bowlers Exhibition Centre in Manchester, debuting an outdoor stage and a lineup that cast a wide but discerning net across the alternative music landscape. Alongside the traditional hardcore bands that have been in rotation since the festival’s formative years (Have Heart, Harm’s Way, Incendiary) and the newer homegrown acts that have followed in their stead (at least seven of whom are from Glasgow), you’ll find everything from experimental hip-hop (16mm filmstock) to midwest emo (American Football) and indie rock (Soccer Mommy), most of which is accompanied by a lot of stage-diving.\nIn many ways, Outbreak is evolving in line with hardcore itself, which is undergoing an intense period of change. In 2022, the New York Times declared an American hardcore “renaissance”, citing a slew of bands such as Gulch, Drain and Drug Church, who are made up of hardcore lifers but driving new excitement in the scene. Since then, things have continued to snowball. In 2023, Baltimore hybridists Turnstile received three Grammy nominations. In May, Kentucky hardcore-metal fusionists Knocked Loose overtook Taylor Swift on Spotify’s Viral 50 chart, which measures how frequently songs are shared. The same month, Torrance, California punks Joyce Manor – who swamped Outbreak’s main stage on Sunday – were a musical guest on John Mulaney’s live Netflix show Everybody’s in LA, performing between St Vincent and Warren G.\nPerhaps one reason why hardcore is experiencing a particularly enthusiastic resurgence is the growing diversity of the scene. Hardcore has always been inclusive, but its aggressive nature has sometimes attracted unwanted attention. In the mid-80s, there was a serious problem of white supremacists storming shows. The more neo-Nazis turned up, the more anti-fascists turned up to fight back, and a scene founded on social awareness and “positive mental attitude (PMA)” – a phrase popularised by Bad Brains, an all-Black band – spiralled into violence.\nA streak of genre purism has also gatekept hardcore by dictating who can express themselves and to what degree, which gave the subculture an overwhelmingly white image. However, a true history of hardcore is one that has always belonged to everyone, whether it’s dub and reggae underpinning punk in the 70s, to the influence of Muslim fusion groups such as Fun-Da-Mental in the 90s, to a more genreless 2010s landscape that saw hip-hop collective Odd Future link up with hardcore act Trash Talk.\nToday, hardcore has never been more diverse, both sonically and in the makeup of its participants. Bands including Soul Glo, Zulu and Scowl are splicing in elements of other genres such as blues, funk, jazz, powerpop and soul. The frontman of rising Sydney band Speed plays the flute on stage. There are multiple groups that sing in Arabic. As the definition of what hardcore “is” becomes less rigid, the sound expands, and that creates more points of entry.\nThis year’s Outbreak lineup boasted an eclectic range of artists, from Moroccan “Harami punk” (Taqbir) and Philadelphian death metal (Scarab) to jazz-rap (redveil). This bill, in turn, drew a crowd that evaded easy categorisation but had a clearly united front. Gen Z kids in clown makeup (fans of California “goth jesters” the Garden) were queueing for pizza with dads sporting Apple watches and jorts. A wheelchair user crowdsurfed during a set by Bristol chain-punks Perp Walk. Almost every artist called for the liberation of Palestine (the singer of Show Me the Body went one step further and offered anyone who disagreed outside for a fight). Whether on stage or in the crowd, these are ultimately people who all share the same DNA of DIY ethics, social justice and musical physicality. That’s hardcore. The sound, then, has increasingly less to do with it. “I don’t call it a hardcore festival any more. I don’t really know how to describe it,” one of the organisers says.\nOne of the challenges an event like Outbreak now faces is preserving the foundations of hardcore with increasing demand for it. Ultimately, it’s a type of music born from and designed for small spaces and sweaty crowds, with no separation between audience and artist. That means no bouncers. No barriers. The stage, if there is one, belongs to everyone: anyone can climb on it and dive into the crowd. Maintaining those values in a large venue with thousands of people requires a lot of paperwork. The same goes for communicating with parts of the music industry that wouldn’t necessarily be involved with a DIY event, from health and safety teams to venue staff and security. “As the festival has grown, it’s really been about welcoming those people into our team and teaching them what [hardcore] is, how people interact with each other, and why it’s safe even though it looks like chaos.”\nUnderstandably, the ballooning interest in hardcore has made some dyed-in-the-wool fans nervous. The more commercially viable a subculture becomes, the more things get lost in translation. That can have an impact on a scene that most people involved don’t view as entertainment, or something to do after work – but as a way of life. At the same time, the barrier to entry is still, realistically, too high for hardcore to go the way of previous underground subculture turned mainstream phenomena, such as Green Day-era pop-punk or My Chemical Romance-era emo. A few bands, like Turnstile, might go the way of red carpets and Top 40 radio, but we’re not likely to hear Knocked Loose frontman Bryan Garris dog-barking at Wembley stadium any time soon.\nFor Outbreak, the future lies in preserving what’s already been built. “It realistically can’t get any bigger than it is now, and truthfully I don’t think it ever needs to be,” an organiser says, adding that it should, above all else, be a space for people to freely express themselves. “That’s the main goal: for people to find their place, feel as if they belong somewhere, and connect with people that are like-minded. As long as the festival is still doing that, I don’t see any reason for it to stop.”\nThe same applies to hardcore at large. It’s been more than 40 years since Bad Brains and Black Flag first kicked down the doors, and their legacy is as moral as it is musical. As long as there are people who feel angry and alienated, there will be a hardcore scene – visible to dozens of people or millions – to mop them up.\nOutbreak returns with a one-day event at BEC Arena, Manchester, on 27 October.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Eva Libertad spent months researching the script of Deaf, speaking to deaf women about pregnancy and parenthood for her drama about motherhood and identity. Almost immediately, the Spanish director knew the film needed a labour scene. “For all the women, giving birth had been a very traumatic event,” she says. She heard stories about women in labour not being informed of procedures, or having their hearing partners removed from the room, depriving them of an interpreter as well as support. “I left out some of the most difficult experiences.”\nHer film gives us a frighteningly realistic birth scene. “Push, push hard,” shouts a doctor behind a face mask at the end of a long, drawn-out labour. The woman giving birth is Ángela, who is deaf and can’t read the doctor’s lips because of their face mask. Frightened and alone, Ángela lunges forward and rips off the mask. Her hearing partner is in the room. He’s meant to be interpreting, but was ordered from her bedside as things began to look like they might go wrong.\nThe common thread in all the stories Libertad heard was a feeling of desperation. “If birth is already difficult for hearing mothers, for deaf mothers it’s worse. There is the feeling: how will I know if something goes wrong? A fear that anything could happen.” Libertad is speaking over Zoom from her home in Molina de Segura, a town near Murcia. She used actual doctors and nurses in the scene to add realism. But no casting process was necessary to find an actor to play her lead character Ángela: Libertad hired her sister, Miriam Garlo, a well-known stage actor who is deaf.\nGarlo was seven years old when she lost most of her hearing as the result of an allergic reaction. “I had a severe ear infection that led to high fevers,” she tells me. “I was given aspirin, which contains an acid that caused hearing damage – I lost 70% of my hearing.” This has now increased to 90%. “At the time, I didn’t experience it as something traumatic. I was just a child. My life changed completely, but I adapted out of survival.”\nAfter studying fine art, Garlo trained as an actor. The sisters collaborated on a short film in 2021 also called Deaf: “At the time, Miriam was considering whether to become a mother,” Libertad says. “She shared with me her fears about becoming a deaf mother in a hearing world. And that’s where the short was born from.”\nIn the end, says Libertad, Garlo decided not to have children. “But when we wrapped on the short, I was left wanting more. What would happen if a baby came along?” So Libertad wrote a feature film about what happened next. Ángela is an artist and potter who lives in the Spanish countryside with her hearing partner Héctor (Álvaro Cervantes), and their dog and chickens. At the start of the film they are in a bubble of pregnancy bliss. The relationship looks as good as it gets; they love each other and their communication is solid. But parenthood changes their dynamic in ways that are difficult to navigate.\nBecoming a mother, says Libertad, throws Ángela back into ableist society. “At the beginning you can see she has ownership over her own life and her own world. But with pregnancy, she once again has to face all these challenges she thought she’d overcome.” We see it most dramatically when she gives birth: the maternity care system is completely unprepared for a deaf woman.\nThe film also shows the day-to-day challenges. When her daughter starts nursery, Ángela finds it difficult to lipread during hurried conversations at pick-ups. A mum asks for her number for the class WhatsApp group. Ángela doesn’t understand. Embarrassed, she smiles and walks away.\nÁngela’s daughter can hear, and in painful scenes Ángela begins to worry that she will be isolated from her baby and partner. “She sees her baby joining this world that she can never be 100% part of. A world that her partner is part of. So she has a fear of being left out.”\nNot for the first time, Libertad tells me that Ángela does not represent all deaf mothers: “That would be impossible. There are as many ways of being a deaf mother as deaf mothers exist in the world.” Besides, hearing women have written to her to say they also identify with Ángela: “They talk about the same fear of not being a good mother, or of not fully bonding with their baby, or the fear of their baby preferring their partner over them.”\nTwo days later I speak to Garlo, Deaf’s star, at her home; she lives four doors down from her sister. There are two interpreters on the video call, one translating Spanish Sign Language into Spanish, the second Spanish to English. For our entire 60-minute conversation, Garlo leans into her camera, her focus sharp. In her job as an actor, she is used to concentrating on the invisible labour of reading lips.\n“With directors who don’t know sign language, I’ve had to really work hard to listen with my eyes, to understand what they want, what they need in a scene,” she says. “I’m doing the work of interpreting. I’m having to make double the effort.” Which sounds exhausting, I say. “It is. It really drains my energy. Because if I don’t understand the instructions for a task, I’m not going to do it well.”\nDeaf shows Garlo’s ability to inhabit a character completely. Her expressive face radiates happiness at the start of the film, then becomes increasingly anxious, taking on an edgy quality. It’s a stunning performance. But when audiences watch the movie, they often assume she is playing a version of herself. That may be because she is being directed by her sister, but ableism is a factor too, says Garlo. “Society still doesn’t understand that if you have an actor with a disability playing a character, the disability doesn’t make the character. But Ángela is not me. Her life decisions are not my life decisions.”\nThat must be incredibly frustrating. She pulls a face as if to say that’s not the half of it. “Yes, it is very frustrating. It’s a stigma that exists towards people with disabilities, and it does bother me, because it makes it seem that I’m unable to develop any kind of character who isn’t exactly the same as me.”\nI read that Garlo did not learn to sign until she was 30. Is that true? She nods. Growing up, her parents didn’t really know much about sign language. They were a loving, caring family, but the focus was on education and academic attainment. “People thought of sign language just as an additional resource,” she says with a shrug. Is there a sense among hearing people that sign language is somehow a lesser language, I ask? “Yes, completely, 100%.”\nBut learning to sign changed Garlo’s life. “Until I was 30, I didn’t understand why life was so difficult. I had to make so much effort to lipread. But once I discovered sign language, it made everything so much easier.” Did she have much involvement in the deaf community before that? She shakes her head. “I had no contact with other deaf people until I was 30.”\nAfter school, she focused all her energy on education, studying fine art in Madrid, then a master’s and a PhD. But something didn’t feel right. “It was a really sad time in my life. I fell into a major depression. I felt awful. I realised that my identity was kind of broken, like it had snapped in two. I realised that I needed sign language to connect with the deaf world. I sought it out. I found the deaf world, and I finally found people who had lives like mine. I did a sign language course when I was 30. Now I’m 40.”\nWhat did it feel like, discovering her deaf identity? Garlo smiles. “I always say the first part of my life was like living in black and white. When I learned sign language, it was like the world suddenly flooded with colour. It was my salvation – finally being able to see all the colours in the world.”\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Musician Frank Benbini is most probably known best as the drummer from Fun Lovin’ Criminals and a latter incarnation of UB40, although as this documentary (which Benbini executive produced) reveals, he’s got a lot of different irons on the proverbial fire; these include a beat combo called Uncle Frank and a reggae group called Radio Riddler. There are other side projects as well, musical and music-adjacent – the occasional bit of barbering with an old friend from Leicester with whom he co-owns a salon, and DJing on BBC Radio Leicester.\nClearly the man has a strong work ethic despite a hard partying image and songs about getting high. A few of his colleagues and employees dare to suggest that he can be a bit of hard taskmaster with a combustible temper. You can’t help wonder what sort of film might have emerged if this weren’t being directed by one of Benbini’s best friends, Steve Baker, who also shot many of his videos over the years. But Benbini’s chatter about himself, his friends and his life reveals quite a bit: you come away with the impression that he truly loves his family and performing, is a bit of prankster, but whatever, he’s a nice enough bloke – albeit one with his own share of anxiety and occasional inability to cope.\nBenbini’s actual music might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but his drumming is certainly tight, and the section where he talks about reggae covers of Prince songs, and collaborating with Sinead O’Connor is arguably the most interesting. (This is also where Baker’s skills as an editor, cutting on the beat, come most to the fore.) The whole thing is clearly a bit of a vanity project, but not an uninteresting one."

    "raw_text": "On the face of it, there’s a formidable aggregation of talent and media firepower on display in this lively but faintly baffling short film set in Lagos, with an original story credit for its producer, the Nigerian super-producer Mo Abudu; it is written and directed by Idris Elba and stars Seal. Within its 19-minute running time it appears to try summarising the action of an entire 90-minute feature film. There isn’t a moment to really relax and explore any relationship in any satisfying and plausible way; the line-readings are rushed and uncomfortable and, most bewilderingly, Seal doesn’t actually get to sing all that much, although as an actor he has a strong and confident address to the camera.\nThe premise is that Millicent (played by Nse Ikpe-Etim) runs a vibrant and hugely successful club in Lagos, but she is very ill, and the question of who is to inherit this lucrative, fashionable place causes a tense confrontation with Millicent’s daughters Comfort (Eku Edewor) and Patience (Atlanta Bridget Johnson) who have come from London with the candid intention of selling up for cash; they resent having to defer to their Lagos-based sister Bisi (Constance Olatunde), who is much more committed to the club. And what causes, or should theoretically cause, the emotional temperature to rise is the reappearance of Johnson (played by Seal), a good-natured musician who has been away in the army and whose paternity of one or all the young women is naturally a central issue.\nInevitably, it is Johnson’s performance, in concert with Bisi, which is to cause instant reconciliation for one and all, but that is a glib, cliched idea that doesn’t work dramatically or musically. Dust to Dreams could have come to life if it had tried to do more with less, perhaps amplify one or two of the many micro-episodes crunched together here.\nAs it is, this feels like a luxury-vanity project and an oddity in the CVs of all the talents involved.\n-\nDust to Dreams is screening at the Toronto film festival"

    "raw_text": "One could cynically look at the credits for the film Poetic License and dismiss it outright. It was directed by Maude Apatow, daughter of Judd, and stars, among others, Apatow’s mother, Leslie Mann, Cooper Hoffman (son of Philip Seymour Hoffman), and Nico Parker (daughter of Thandiwe Newton and film-maker Ol Parker). On paper it all looks like a make-work project to keep the well-connected busy and creatively fulfilled. But the film itself – Apatow’s debut – is rich and lively enough to make none of the nepo stuff really matter.\nWritten by Raffi Donatich, Poetic License concerns a family who have moved from Chicago to a sleepy university town where economist James (Cliff “Method Man” Smith), has secured a plum professorship. He’s busy getting started, which leaves his wife Liz (Mann) a bit lonely and unmoored in her new life. Making matters worse is the inevitable drifting away of her high school-senior daughter, Dora (Parker), whose effort to make friends at her new school means she has to spend a little less time with mom. Liz is prone to a little risk, and so when two college boys, Sam and Ari, who are in the poetry class she’s auditing begin soliciting a friendship, she throws caution to the wind and accepts.\nIt’s a cute setup, faintly reminiscent of the social complications of a Nicole Holofcener film (particularly 2013’s note-perfect Enough Said). Donatich’s script is a little less brainy, but there are enough witty observations about human foibles and needs to bring to mind Holofcener, a master of the form. There are also traces of Apatow the elder ribboning through the film, an improvisatory vibe that keeps things loose and, at times, a little baggy. Creating such a natural, lived-in texture is a tricky feat for any film-maker, let alone a first timer, so credit is due to Apatow the younger, known as an actor in TV’s Euphoria, for so deftly finding the film’s warm, inviting cadence.\nThat would probably have been a far more difficult task with the wrong actors. But Apatow has cast smartly. Of course, she already knew that her mother is quite capable of playing Liz’s jumble of earthy empathy and daffy neuroticism. But she also deftly corrals Hoffman’s flurry of idiosyncrasies. And she helps Andrew Barth Feldman, who plays the other boy barging into Liz’s life, expand on the endearingly twitchy energy he showed in such spades in 2023’s No Hard Feelings. The three have a sparking, complementary chemistry, bouncing off of each other’s energy in endlessly appealing and amusing fashion.\nThere could be a far darker, more psychosexual take on a story like this, but Poetic License mostly wants to take it easy. The boys do, of course, each develop crushes on Liz, and some mild calamity ensues. But Apatow and Donatich choose to see the sweetness in that, rather than delving into the unseemly implications of that dawning love and lust. They do inch the film toward that third rail on occasion, though, moments of giddy bluntness that go a long way in preventing the niceness of the movie from becoming cloying.\nUnlike the unsettlingly slavish devotion that Hallie Meyers-Shyer showed to her director parent, Nancy, in her first film, Home Again, Apatow maintains at least some distance from her father’s signature style. The influence is clearly there, and the film does drag on perhaps just a shade too long, as much of Judd Apatow’s work does. But Poetic License is far from mere pastiche. It has a distinct, youthful sensibility and sources its comedy more from recognisably human behaviour than from profane, one-liner riffing.\nStill, it is quite the family affair, daughter directing mother in a story partly about a mother and a daughter struggling to grow together and on their own. One hopes the experience was more pleasant than anything else; not everyone could survive taking direction from their child, or giving it to their parent. Whatever the arrangements or understandings were on set, one doesn’t feel a sense of carefully managed compromise in the final product. Poetic License would probably play well to someone who has no idea who the Apatows are.\nAfter all, Mann is only one part of the triumvirate leading the film. Apatow allows plenty of room for Feldman and Cooper to make the movie their own, an opportunity they seize with winsome aplomb. It’s easy to see why Sam and Ari fall for caring, empathic, erratic Liz. But Cooper and Feldman have so much offbeat charm that one does wonder why Liz isn’t, way down deep, perhaps equally smitten. It would be the cutest kind of taboo.\n-\nPoetic License is screening at the Toronto film festival and is seeking distribution"

    "raw_text": "Though criminally underpaid and disrespected, teachers are nonetheless held to rigidly high standards of care, compassion and rectitude. They are to be exemplary stewards of our children, while unflinchingly enduring the battering of parents, administrators and outside agitators. Which is why it’s often so compelling, in a dark and squirmy way, to watch them break bad on film.\nWe have, of course, seen plenty of ill-advised (or illegal) sexual relationships between teacher and student, in myriad movies and TV programs. Beyond that hoary trope, though, we’ve observed with alarm the drug-addled overstepping of Ryan Gosling in Half Nelson; we’ve been guiltily thrilled by the obsessive opportunism of The Kindergarten Teacher; we’ve pried nosily into the shifty criminality of Hugh Jackman in Bad Education. These stories all present a grimly alluring vision: carefully maintained professionalism giving way to baser impulse.\nNow joining that club is Saoirse Ronan in Bad Apples, an alternately sinister and silly drama about a teacher who takes radical action to deal with a problem student. Ronan is Maria, a lonely and jilted educator living in a drably anonymous corner of the United Kingdom (the film was shot in Bristol). Whatever passion and zeal she once had – that trumpet-blare of higher calling – has faded in the face of an impossible obstacle. A boy, violent and disruptive tween Danny (Eddie Waller), essentially prevents Maria from focusing on any other child in her class. Her job has been reduced to little more than crowd control, which her superiors think she ought to do without assistance or complaint.\nIt’s a maddening, seemingly hopeless situation, one that director Jonatan Etzler effectively captures in all its clenching frustration. There is some empathy for the plight of teachers in there, but Bad Apples is ultimately not aiming to be a cri de cœur for woefully underappreciated and underresourced faculty. It is more concerned with creating a mood of wicked transgression than anything else.\nBefore long, a rash, messy crime brings Maria and Danny strangely closer to one another, while pushing her (and the film) further and further from the realm of credibility. Bad Apples, based on Rasmus Lindgren’s Swedish language novel De Oönskade (The Unwanted), is an attempt at can’t-believe-they-went-there satire. But Etzler and screenwriter Jess O’Kane stop short of anything truly shocking or dangerous.\nMaria has certainly done a terrible thing, and yet the film surrounding her is wishy-washy about whether to condemn or abet her. It needn’t do either entirely – moral ambivalence is a fine pose for a movie like this to strike – but one longs for more conviction from Etzler, a bolder point of view or a more complicated argument that would elevate Bad Apples above mere half-hearted provocation. As is, the film limps around in a kind of no man’s land between easygoing and extreme.\nStill, Etzler manages some nasty comedy, sourced from the bracing jolt of watching teacher and student cruelly manipulate one another. And he shows a sturdy technical command throughout; his closing shot is especially persuasive, a picture of society’s persistent imperfection charging headlong at a happy ending it’s determined to ruin.\nWhat really sells the film, though, are its lead performances. Ronan, one of the more adaptable actors of her generation, shrewdly teases out the desperate anger rippling under Maria’s facade of calm. She’s at once sympathetic and a little frightening, keeping the audience uncertain about just how far Maria will go to preserve the tenuous balance she’s wrestled into being. If only the film-making rose to meet that level of nuance and unease.\nAs brutish, feral Danny, Waller knows just when to be awful – letting slip a glimpse of the monster that Danny might grow into – and when to reveal the hurting, neglected child he still is. It’s a delicate, disarmingly thoughtful debut performance. As is that of his young co-star Nia Brown, who plays Pauline, a teacher’s pet suck-up whose pigtail braids and cow-eyed, Coke-bottle gaze belie something ruthless and, perhaps, more menacing than any of Danny’s erratic rampaging.\nPauline is, in some ways, the true thematic heart of the film, a kid who has been far more warped by a struggling system than anyone realizes. One longs for the film to truly dial in on her, to allow her to put Bad Apples in her basket and carry it off into the woods, toward the bleak and baleful place a riskier, more exciting film might explore. We should all fear the Dannys of the world, but it’s the Paulines who tend to get us in the end.\n-\nBad Apples is screening at the Toronto film festival and will be released at a later date"

    "raw_text": "As Etta James might say: at last. A romantic comedy that is romantic and funny and not simply an insult to the intelligence of all carbon-based life forms. Nicole Holofcener’s Enough Said is a step up for this director, in whose previous work I have sometimes heard a few false notes – inaudible, I should however confess, to many others. She has created a thoroughly likable and genuinely funny film and its stars, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini, are a revelation, singly and together. Like their director, they unassumingly but decidedly took it to the next level on this movie. The fact that Gandolfini still had so much to offer as an actor is desperately sad.\nEnough Said is about what love means in middle age and what it means to decide that some other divorced person is The One, or rather The New One, when the rational side of you knows that this person must surely be culpable, at least in part, for the death of their previous relationship. They must have awful habits that sunk the first marriage – habits that will only become clear once you have made a commitment to them. And by the same token, you too must have relationship-killing tendencies. Is the triumph of hope over experience a viable thing to wish for, the second time around?\nLouis-Dreyfus plays a physical therapist called Eva, while Gandolfini is Albert. They meet at a swanky party and there is a connection: both are divorced and facing the same kind of loneliness; each lives with a grownup daughter who is about to leave home for college. But the comic frisson that sparks the film into life is something that predates this scenario – it’s the initial hallucination or optical illusion: when Elaine Benes met Tony Soprano!\nHolofcener is clearly aware of the baggage these actors bring to the movie, and even playfully pre-empts and undermines our expectations by making Albert an archivist in an audio-visual library of TV classics. He supervises a viewing area where people watch TV gems on video with headphones. Albert can recite what was on TV on any given day in the 1970s but says, tongue in cheek, that he is not interested in contemporary television.\nIn fact, Enough Said’s great second-act plot development has a Seinfeldian ingenuity, and the comic discomfort surrounding a vocal tic of Albert’s is something Jerry Seinfeld or Larry David might have been proud to have written. In her scene pointing out this appalling tic at a dinner party, Louis-Dreyfus is very funny, with all of Elaine’s satirically wide-eyed astonishment and incredulity and theatrically suppressed laughter, but with a new undertow of sadness.\nAs for Gandolfini, he only becomes Sopranoesque, with that menacing deadness of eye, at a dark stage towards the end, and then not for long. The rest of the time he is quite different, and Enough Said brings home how much other directors have been in thrall to his small-screen mobster creation. Even Gandolfini’s performance in Andrew Dominik’s Killing Them Softly opposite Brad Pitt, though a great piece of work, was an obvious variation on the Soprano theme. But here he seems reserved, droll, self-deprecating, a thoughtful and even cerebral figure. That trademark Gandolfini mannerism, the laborious nasal wheezing, is almost entirely absent, though Holofcener cleverly alludes to this by having Eva ask him about it in bed. Albert just shrugs and says he broke his nose a couple of times.\nAlbert and Eva’s relationship has to be negotiated within a tricky network of loyalties. Eva knows people like Sarah (Toni Collette) and Marianne (Catherine Keener), who for various reasons are flawed as confidantes. She has her daughter, Ellen (Tracey Fairaway) – but she is about to leave home and is looking forward to emotional independence, and is moreover baffled and irritated at Eva’s new quasi-maternal friendship with her best friend, Chloe (Tavi Gevinson). This is not really a supportive female chorus: it is just something making Eva’s life more complicated than it already is.\nAfter Nora Ephron, it hasn’t been clear who will take over the grownup rom-com mantle: Nancy Meyers has looked far too escapist, with lovelorn fantasies that seem to exist only for the smugly wealthy. With Enough Said, it looks like Holofcener is a contender. This film is a smart and winning story about what is involved in the painful re-illusionment of middle-aged love.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Two years after Stranger Things transformed the Australian actor Dacre Montgomery into an overnight heart-throb at 22, he retreated home to Perth. From there he said no to every role that came his way for four years, bar a season-four cameo and a small part in Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis.\n“I lost my anonymity overnight and it scared the shit out of me,” Montgomery, now 30, says. He speaks fast and taps the table in time with those last words, a brimmed cap sitting low over his face. “That was a big driving force for stepping back.”\nWe’re in a Sydney bar on a quiet Wednesday in the lead-up to the release of Went Up the Hill – an icy possession drama set in New Zealand’s Southern Alps by the Australian writer-director Samuel van Grinsven. It stars Montgomery alongside Phantom Thread’s Vicky Krieps as a pair of strangers whose relationship grows increasingly antic as they mourn a mutual relative.\nIt’s the first of a series of anticipated films starring Montgomery, including a remake of the 70s mondo horror Faces of Death, alongside Barbie Ferreira and Charli xcx, as well as Gus van Sant’s Dead Man’s Wire, a true-crime thriller about the 1977 kidnapping of a mortgage broker that premiered at Venice to glowing reviews. It’s a sharp reversal from a few years ago, when his frustrated Hollywood agent dropped him.\n“I needed to stop and recalibrate,” he says. “I also [knew] that I wanted more and I had more to give.”\nMontgomery’s ascent didn’t allow for contemplation. He landed his first major role – leading 2017’s unsuccessful Power Rangers film reboot – before he finished his acting degree at the prestigious Western Australia Academy of Performing Arts.\nThough a four-film deal disappeared after Power Rangers’ meagre box office take, it didn’t matter. Months later hundreds of millions of Netflix subscribers tuned into Stranger Things’ second season starring Montgomery as Billy Hargrove, Hawkins’ mulleted bad boy lifeguard and eventual literal demon.\nBrooding, handsome and evil, Montgomery’s live-wire performance captured a passionate fanbase – the type that meant he could get a quarter of a million likes on a low-res Instagram post of a blue-black gradient shared to more than 7 million followers. The attention was overwhelming but Montgomery also questioned where his career was heading.\n“Don’t get me wrong, I love commercial films,” he says. “But I grew up watching auteur films. I wanted characters that challenged me to the greatest extent.”\nIn the wake of Stranger Things, those characters didn’t come. “So I waited. And waited. And waited.”\nWith commercial and endorsement work steady, Montgomery experimented. He released a beat-inspired poetry podcast and book, both titled DKMH (after his full name, Dacre Kaye Montgomery-Harvey), and directed a handful of high-concept short films, ranging from sci-fi to viscerally violent works about motherhood.\nBut he credits his return to Went Up the Hill, in which he plays Jack, a young queer man who arrives in New Zealand to attend the funeral of his estranged abusive mother, Elizabeth, and meets her wife, Jill (Krieps), for the first time. They cloister themselves in Elizabeth’s house as her spirit possesses each of their bodies. The presence is welcome but menacing, as Jack and Jill try to understand her abuse without falling victim to it again.\nMontgomery was instantly drawn to the acting challenge of a “three-hander told by two people”, as well as the script’s exploration of inherited trauma.\n“My mum had really bad postnatal depression when I was born,” he says. “I think a lot of my anxieties come from that. So it feels a part of me, in a weird way.\n“And then, in some ways, my anxiety is the fire that fuels my ambition or my work ethic. It’s part of me, her trauma.”\nVan Grinsven says Montgomery was cast because of his “dangerous” onscreen presence. It’s the same intensity he exudes his viral Stranger Things audition, in which he dances shirtless to Come on Eileen between scenes, though comments focus more on his intense stare – also the subject of many TikTok videos.\n“He feels like he could explode at any moment,” Van Grinsven says. “And coupled with how beautifully raw and sensitive he is as a real person, that together felt really interesting to me in a film [about] the abused welcoming an abuser into their body.”\nShot on location at Flock Hill Lodge, a five-star resort overlooking Lake Pearson that hadn’t yet opened, the cast and crew were incredibly isolated – and cold. Pulling from New Zealand’s rich cinema of unease, the mountainous landscape is as haunted as the lodge, a gorgeous outpost of concrete, glass and wood creaking in the wind.\n“I liken it to The Shining, right?” Montgomery says. “I would have nightmares all night, so I didn’t sleep the whole production … We were all going crazy.”\nMontgomery struggled to shake the film until its premiere last September at Toronto international film festival. “I just bawled my eyes out the whole film, because there’s so much of me and Vicky in there. I felt like I shed it that night. I was like, ‘I’m done. I never have to watch the film again.’”\nFrom there, the floodgates opened. In addition to his upcoming acting credits, Montgomery is also aiming to shoot his directorial feature debut The Engagement Party this year in Western Australia.\nPenned by Went Up the Hill’s co-writer Jory Anast, it’s a relationship drama about two couples on a remote holiday who are forced to examine a murky shared memory. “I’m brimming with ideas, and a lot of the heads of department we have on board are like, ‘Woah, you’re intense. You’re a lot,” he says, laughing. “I’m like, ‘What are you gonna do?’”\n-\nWent Up the Hill is out now in US cinemas and is released on Thursday in Australian cinemas\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "With terrific chutzpah, black-comic flair and cool, cruel unsentimentality, screenwriter Austin Kolodney and director Gus Van Sant have made a true-crime suspense thriller set in the 1970s, tapping into the spirit of both Sidney Lumet’s Dog Day Afternoon and Network. Apart from anything else, it is a reminder that in that post-Kennedy, post-Watergate age, plenty of lawless and febrile things happened that would now be considered phenomena purely attributable to social media.\nIn 1977, an Indianapolis businessman named Tony Kiritsis, with many acquaintances in the police department, kidnapped a mortgage broker named Richard Hall, and tied Hall’s neck with a “dead man’s wire” to his shotgun, which would therefore go off if police sharpshooters tried to kill him. Kiritsis even paraded his victim like this on TV while he read out his demands, a grotesque display in which national TV networks were blandly complicit. Van Sant’s recreation of this extraordinary moment calls to mind the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in front of police and press.\nKiritsis had mortgaged himself to buy land he thought could be developed as a shopping mall, but fell behind with the loan repayments and became convinced – perhaps not without reason – that Hall and his fellow mortgage broker father were manipulating and exploiting the situation with secret designs on his land. Bill Skarsgård, as tense and pop-eyed as a character in The Simpsons, plays the paranoid and rage-filled Kiritsis; Dacre Montgomery is the unhappy Hall imprisoned in Kiritsis’s apartment with the wire-noose around his throat and the shotgun barrel jammed to his neck for 72 hours straight. Al Pacino has an uproarious cameo in the “southern gentleman” voice that he has adopted these days, as Hall’s high-handed father who refuses to give Kiritsis the apology he wants over the phone and even jeers at his son for having “Stockholm syndrome”. Myha’la (from TV’s Industry) plays fictionalised TV reporter Linda Page determined not to be cheated of her scoop, and Colman Domingo has a richly enjoyable role as imperturbably laid-back radio DJ and phone-in host Fred Temple, based on the real life Indianapolis radio star Fred Heckman, whom Kiritsis actually did call up to broadcast his grievances on the air.\nWhat is extraordinary about this drama is that, played another way, Hall’s unspeakable ordeal – for that is surely what it was – would be material for something deeply and almost unthinkably shocking. But Hall’s mental health and what would presumably be lifelong PTSD is given scant attention here, mimicking the media and the courts at the time who were instead infatuated by the issue of whether Kiritsis was insane and if he was therefore entitled to an insanity plea. (By contrast,the US’s other great kidnapping case of the time, the 1974 abduction of Jack Teich, was the subject of Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s novel Long Island Compromise, which explored the idea of generational PTSD that went down to the victim’s children.)\nThe personae and performances of Pacino, Domingo and Myha’la complicate the psychopathic nastiness of the affair, and create something surreal and bizarre and often hilarious: a display of, not heartlessness, exactly, but a shrewd professional sense that pity and fear were emotions that could only benefit the kidnapper. It’s a gripping picture with excellent performances."

    "raw_text": "Justin Bieber’s Swag II adds 23 tracks to his already over-stuffed Swag project, and it’s not just the title that lacks imagination. Like its predecessor, released just two months ago, Swag II unites a buzzy team of producers and writers known for freshening up R’n’B and hands them a precisely curated Pinterest board: Dangerous-era Michael Jackson, D’Angelo’s lush arrangements, Jai Paul’s glitchy, retro-futurist sonics and the sun-bleached textures of current collaborators Mk.gee and Dijon. But with unadventurous songwriting, the result is (another) album that’s all vibe and voguish production, and very little substance.\nOpener Speed Demon reheats Bieber’s “is it clocking to you” meme for the second time across both albums, albeit with a bright, funky bravado and a memorably bonkers chorus about “checking these chickens”, AKA leaving his critics in the dust. But for a song bragging about ambition, it lacks adrenaline – like many of Swag II’s safe, repetitive tracks.\nMuch of the album offers an interesting, textured backdrop for Bieber’s pleading croon, and then goes nowhere. Oh Man just repeats its title. Open Up Your Heart, a frosty, Phil Collins-indebted ballad, teases progression – a key change, maybe! – only for absolutely nothing to happen. Love Song has a gorgeous, screwed-up string-section and some tepid “wooo!”s, neither of which can disguise how the track never earns those thrills. Rather, words fail Bieber as he sings about wanting to write his wife a love song – “a good one”.\nEverything Hallelujah suffers a similar fate, transforming a profound realisation about his faith into lyrical mundanity (“brush my teeth, hallelujah”) and musical cliche, with squeaking acoustic guitar strings serving as an easy shorthand for authenticity. Likewise Story of God, the nearly eight-minute sermon which closes the record: Bieber retells Adam and Eve (co-written by a pastor from his preferred celebrity megachurch) with generic ambient swooshes to underscore its sincerity.\nSwag II is most convincing when it leans hard into pop – and all the way out the other side. Don’t Wanna has a fidgety MJ wriggle to it, with much-needed playfulness brought by UK alt singer Bakar, and the Dijon co-written Bad Honey fizzes with squirmy synths as Bieber’s both pissed off and turned on: “If you’re bad, honey, why you look so good?”\nIn contrast (and with Frank Ocean’s Blond on the pinboard), Moving Fast’s soft, blurry guitar and musings on a life lived too quickly has genuine pathos – as does Safe Space, dissolving into Baltimore club for a real, wind-in-your-face sense of freedom.\nTaken cynically, Swag II uses a trending aesthetic and quantity over quality to pander to streaming platforms – and Bieber’s certainly not the only pop star playing that game. More generously, it’s an under-edited try-on of a more alternative sound, aided by talented collaborators watering down their own special sauce. Dijon’s album Baby is one of the year’s boldest – maximalist, crammed with ideas, fun. Swag and Swag II come nowhere close, but within these 40-plus tracks are 10 songs that would have made a genuinely surprising statement from Bieber. Instead, they’re buried beneath a heap of blandly samey songs with nothing much to say."

    "raw_text": "In the mid-2010s, pop music changed. Instead of hounding the listening public with focus-grouped, machine-tooled crowd-pleasers, the biggest stars began releasing expansive, experimental albums that played to their own tastes and interests. These were records that were artistically self-indulgent, mostly in a good way: Rihanna’s sleazy, sultry Anti, Beyoncé’s densely referential Lemonade, Lady Gaga’s soft-rock-heavy Joanne, Miley Cyrus’s psychedelic Wayne Coyne collaboration Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (I may be the only person who holds that example in such high regard.)\nWith his fourth album Purpose, Justin Bieber was adjacent to this shift. Leaning into the ascendant tropical house genre, collaborating with Skrillex and pursuing a sound you sensed a 21-year-old might actually like, it spelled the end of Bieber’s career as a cheesy tween idol and repositioned him as a leading figure in the pop zeitgeist. But Purpose still felt like an album designed to spew highly accessible hits. And it did.\nA decade on, however – after backsliding into forgettable, generic pop on 2021’s Justice – Bieber has finally made what seems to be a genuine 2015-style passion project. Swag, the 31-year-old’s surprise-released seventh album, opens extremely promisingly with All I Can Take, a hauntological twist on spotless, energetic 1980s R&B: echoey vocals, fast, faded beats, maudlin synths that seem half-remembered from a dream. Abetted by a songwriting and production team that includes Carter Lang (SZA), Tobias Jesso Jr (Dua Lipa, Adele), Eddie Benjamin, Dylan Wiggins and Daniel Chetrit, the sonic vibe echoes throughout the album.\nIt comes festooned with layered melisma on Butterflies, gated reverb and laser-style synths on the gorgeous Too Long and hyperactive, washed-out drums on First Place. Elsewhere, Bieber’s default sweet and smooth R&B base is counterbalanced by chugging guitar and crashing percussion (the Mk.gee-produced Daisies) and fingers-on-fretboard squeaks of acoustic guitar (the lo-fi Zuma House). Lil B collaboration Dadz Love merges gospelly vocals with a fuzzy breakbeat and blissed-out synths to similarly beautiful effect.\nIt’s all very considered, cleverly nostalgic and subtly satisfying – there’s not a craven chart smash in earshot. Lyrically, however, Swag isn’t such a classy and thoughtful affair. Dadz Love is an inane celebration of Bieber’s nascent fatherhood that essentially just repeats the title into meaninglessness. The other love songs – which are addressed to his wife, Hailey, whose viral lip gloss-holding phone case gets a shout-out on Go Baby – rarely transcend superficial, saccharine cliche. But they are at least preferable to the eye-watering spoken-word segments.\nDuring a handful of conversations with internet personality Druski, Bieber bemoans the reaction to his discomfitingly intimate social media posts, which have worried fans in recent months (if “people are always asking if I’m OK … it starts to make me feel like I’m the one with issues and everyone else is perfect”). He gets gently ribbed about his altercations with the paparazzi – two examples of which are sampled on this album – and told, sycophantically, that despite his white skin, his musicality is such that he must have a “Black” soul.\nThese cringeworthy interludes show a Bieber determined to refute the unflattering caricature of him that prevails in the tabloid sphere. But you would struggle to find much evidence of a three-dimensional human being in his lyrics, which are low on specifics, insight or originality. Despite the album’s seductive, almost spookily evocative sound, the lasting impression is one of eerie emptiness. Swag has moments of brilliance, but this is no long-awaited masterpiece."

    "raw_text": "Pop, rock and more\nDavid Byrne – Who Is the Sky?\nFor Byrne’s first album since his hugely acclaimed American Utopia tour – and the subsequent Spike Lee-directed film – he’s working with an orchestra, as well as St Vincent and Paramore singer Hayley Williams, among others. The two tracks released so far, She Explains Things To Me and Everybody Laughs, have proved to be sweetly sunny and driven by acoustic guitar. The accompanying tour – due to reach Europe next year – will apparently “blend visual art, storytelling and music into one compelling live performance”.\nReleased 5 September\nSaint Etienne – International\nSaint Etienne have been an endlessly fascinating fixture on the leftfield of pop for 25 years, spawning everything from Top 10 singles to documentaries about the Lea Valley and the South Bank. Their most recent albums I’ve Been Trying To Tell You and The Night have delved into concept-driven ambient experimental territory with hugely rewarding results, but International is to be their final release. Something of the breadth of their approach is revealed by the list of collaborators, which stretches from DJ Erol Alkan to 80s heart-throb Nick Heyward.\nReleased 5 September\nJade – That’s Showbiz Baby\nJade Thirlwall’s former band Little Mix made a clutch of great hits but nothing that could prepare you for the deeply idiosyncratic charms of Thirwall’s tempo-shifting Puppet On a String-sampling Angel of My Dreams. If subsequent releases haven’t quite bent the rules in such a striking manner, then they’ve certainly been of an impressively high quality, pushing her debut solo album into the “eagerly awaited” category.\nReleased 12 September\nSelf Esteem\nRebecca Taylor’s third album as Self Esteem, A Complicated Woman, didn’t propel her into pop’s big league in the way some people expected, but no matter. The high-concept, tightly choreographed live shows she’s thus far performed around it – in a West End theatre shortly before its release and at a packed-out Park stage at Glastonbury shortly after – were rapturously received and understandably so: a sometime actor, Taylor has a keen sense of theatricality, but she’s also a straightforwardly commanding, hugely engaging performer.\nTour begins 15 September, 02 Academy Birmingham\nCardi B – Am I the Drama?\nThe follow-up to a debut album that came out in 2018 – the rapper has been concentrating on motherhood in the intervening period – Am I the Drama? has been so long in the pipeline that at least one of the singles confirmed as part of the tracklisting, the chart-topping, controversy-generating Megan Thee Stallion collaboration WAP, is five years old. Whatever your reasons, taking an extended leave of absence is a risky business in a genre as fast-moving as hip-hop: whether Am I the Drama? succeeds in re-establishing her at its centre remains to be seen.\nReleased 19 September\nKokoroko\nThe London jazz collective’s most recent album Tuff Times Never Last offered up a gorgeous selection of midtempo but funky tracks influenced in equal part by Afrobeat, highlife and – occasionally – old-fashioned 80s British soul. Its contents were frequently gorgeous – blissful single Sweetie is a hot afternoon in musical form – but when playing live, the band really come into their own: the danceability is amped up, the fluid virtuosity of the musicianship becomes even more evident.\nTour begins 19 September, Leeds Project House\nRobert Plant – Saving Grace\nRobert Plant’s “new” band – formed with musicians local to his home on the Welsh borders – first debuted six years ago with a handful of small UK gigs at which they performed an intriguing range of covers and a couple of Led Zeppelin classics. A similar approach informs their debut album, intermittently recorded over six years, with the admirably eclectic Plant and co essaying tracks by everyone from Memphis Minnie to Moby Grape to Low.\nReleased 26 September\nLady Gaga\nThe noisy electronics, big pop choruses and dancefloor-facing beats of Lady Gaga’s last album Mayhem felt like a restatement of her core pop values after the commercial and creative wobble of her appearance in Joker: Folie à Deux and her accompanying jazz-infused album Harlequin. If US reviews are anything to go by, the Mayhem Ball tour offers a suitably eye-popping high-camp, high-production-value theatrical extravaganza, described by one unexpected concert-goer, Nancy Pelosi, as “the most fun I’ve had in a long time”.\nTour begins 29 September, London O2 Arena\nCMAT\nPop is a notoriously tricky business to predict, but you wouldn’t bet against CMAT’s third album Euro-Country being a hit on a scale that far outstrips her past work. It’s musically more expansive than its country-infused predecessors and stuffed with fantastic, provocative songs, as evidenced by the viral success of Take a Sexy Picture of Me. And, as anyone who caught her Glastonbury appearance knows, she is absolutely fantastic live: sharp, exceptionally funny, blessed with an incredible voice and quite unlike anyone else around.\nTour begins 2 October, O2 Academy Brixton\nTaylor Swift – The Life of a Showgirl\nRumblings of a new Swift album seemed impossible: the glitter from the Eras tour had only just settled; she had a new album just last year. Underrate pop’s most high-achieving workaholic at your peril: she recently revealed that she recorded her 12th album between Eras dates, flying to Sweden to record with Max Martin and Shellback – the co-architects of her most laser-guided pop smashes from Red, 1989 and Reputation. No one’s heard a peep, but she’s promised “melodies that [are] so infectious you’re almost angry … and lyrics that are just as vivid”.\nReleased 3 October\nLittle Simz\nSimz’s sixth album, Lotus, was not an easy listen: it emerged from a period of turmoil in which she started and scrapped four different full-length projects and ended up suing her former chief collaborator Inflo; its angry, diaristic lyrics were matched with raw, occasionally rock-facing production. But it seems to have done nothing to halt the rapper’s continuing rise: after she curated and performed at this year’s Meltdown festival on the South Bank, she’s ascended to arenas for this autumn tour.\nTour begins 16 October, Manchester Co-op Live\nJalen Ngonda\nIf your tastes run to classic soul, then US-born, UK-based singer-songwriter Jalen Ngonda represents the real deal. His voice is incredible – there are shades of Marvin Gaye and David Ruffin about his delivery, but his sound is his own – and he’s a skilled songwriter, as his 2023 debut album Come Around and Love Me and the handful of singles he’s released since displayed. He’s also reliably fantastic live: relentless touring means tickets are already running low for these UK shows.\nTour begins 16 October, Newcastle City Hall\nJasmine.4.t\nJasmine Cruickshank’s You Are the Morning is one of 2025’s finest debut albums. She has what would once have been called “heavy friends” on board – it was produced by Boygenius, whose Phoebe Bridgers signed Cruickshank to her Saddest Factory label – but, in truth, she doesn’t need the endorsement of alt-rock royalty. She’s a fantastic songwriter in the old-fashioned, rough-hewn indie manner, who’s transformed tough personal challenges into powerful and ultimately joy-bringing music.\nTour begins 11 November, London Scala\nKneecap\nSomewhere underneath the continual tumult surrounding Kneecap, there lurks a band who are exceptionally good at what they do, not that the attendant furore has dented their popularity. Quite the opposite: a July gig in Glasgow sold out in 80 seconds after they were dropped from the Trnsmt festival, while this tour is bookended by a September date at Wembley Arena – which provoked more controversy after a poster advertising the show was banned from the London Underground – and two sold-out arena dates in Dublin.\nTour begins 18 September at the OVO Arena Wembley London\nLorde\nLorde debuted her fourth album Virgin, in its entirety, at a not-so-secret performance at this summer’s Glastonbury, her first live appearance in the UK for three years. That it attracted a mixed response tells you more about playing 40 minutes of unheard material to a festival audience than said material’s quality: Virgin is an impressively dark, emotionally ragged restatement of the dance-pop sound of 2017’s Melodrama – and expectations understandably run high for her tour.\nTour begins 15 November, Manchester Co-op Live\nStereolab\nAfter a decade-long hiatus, Stereolab returned to a pop world that seemed to have come around to their way of thinking, at least a little. Critically revered outliers in the 90s – lyrics influenced by Marxist critical theory, music by Krautrock and esoteric electronica – they now find themselves acclaimed by Tyler, the Creator and Pharrell Williams, their motorik sound a regular rock trope, and their critiques of late-stage capitalism mainstreamed. And yet they still sound entirely unique and wonderful: comeback album Instant Holograms on Metal Film is a gem.\nTour begins 15 December at Royal Festival Hall, London\nClassical\nThe Dream of Gerontius\nA homecoming for Elgar’s mighty oratorio – the greatest of his choral works.

    "raw_text": "Last month, the indefatigable Vice magazine published a piece on the “summer of British chaos”, documenting a scene of deranged social media provocateurs existing at the crispiest fringes of our nation’s cooked identity. Writer Clive Martin defined these graven images of the algorithm as being regionally specific, lurid, rowdy, funny and hedonistic. As a former member of Little Mix, a girl band popularised by public vote on The X Factor, Jade Thirlwall might not seem like the likeliest bedfellow of this unhinged movement. But the South Shields pop star’s debut solo single, last year’s Angel of My Dreams, dodged focus-grouped smoothness to present a sublimely whacked-out, thoroughly British pop vision that felt like spinning through someone else’s for you page and realising they exist in a markedly different universe from your own.\nIt started with a wound-up sample of Puppet on a String, exploded into a falsetto-spiked power ballad, then grinding electroclash paired with a withering rap, then sped through each mode again, variously at double and half speed. Its wild energy was fuelled by contradiction: Gucci glamour paired with lines such as “If I don’t win, I’m in the bin”. And while Jade dissed Syco and X Factor boss Simon Cowell (“selling my soul to a psycho”), the song’s vaulting soundclashes defying his bland vision of pop, Angel was also her love letter to the toxic paramour of fame: a status that might be easier to sustain with more conventional fare than whiplashing Sandie Shaw into growling synths. It was crackers and brilliant: no former boy- or girl-bander has come close to making such an arresting reintroduction since – and I mean this as the highest possible praise – Geri Halliwell burned bright through a short-lived fit of dadaist genius.\nIt set the bar extremely high for Jade’s long-awaited debut album, That’s Showbiz Baby! At least in its first half, ideas brawl for space and kick up thrilling novelty from the dust. The contrast between lavish balladry and techno wub on It Girl recalls Beyoncé’s brazen tapestry-like song constructions; the saucy, stalking Midnight Cowboy, about “givin’ you the Ginuwine”, imagines what it might have been like had her western-inspired Cowboy Carter been as much ribald, clubby fun as its predecessor Renaissance. The rhapsodic Fantasy is Jessy Lanza with budget, its lyrics about egging each other on to get freaky in bed mirrored by the song’s speeding momentum. FUFN (Fuck You For Now) is a dry ice-swathed Eurovision stomper that’s far more poised than Jade’s lyrics about the messiness of a drunken fight with a lover on a night out – but in its all-pistons-firing Gaga maximalism, it honours this particularly British display as a moment of high-diva drama.\nNot all the experiments land so well. Unconditional is a tribute to Jade’s mother, who has lupus. “I thought: how can I write a really sad song that we’re all going to want to shake our tits to?” Jade has said. It’s an admirable aim, but the lovely shift from New Order-style melancholy electronica to Moroder adrenaline would work better without the slamming blasts of electric guitar and the distracting “pew pew” synths. And Headache, about knowing you’re sometimes a massive pain in the arse to your long-suffering partner, proves its point too effectively in its racket of thumping bass and dentist-drill vocals.\nIf there’s a theme amid the madness, it’s finding the freedom to be exactly yourself – at work, in relationships, in bed. Jade’s lyrics are spiked with very her, very British moments without overdoing it: Midnight Cowboy has the excellent triptych, “I’m a real wild bitch, yeah I’m mental / I’m the ride of your life, not a rental / I’m the editor, call me Mr Enninful.” And she nails some really lovely specific sentiments. Plastic Box channels Robyn’s pained electropop solitude as Jade struggles with the knowledge that her partner had relationships that came before her – she knows it’s irrational, but still honours those very real anxieties with solemn beauty. “Can I have your heart in a plastic box?” she asks. “Never used, fully clean, untouched / Like I’m the only one you’ve ever loved.” Disingenuousness gets short shrift: Natural at Disaster almost certainly reads former Little Mix bandmate Jesy Nelson her rights, after she burned through several metric tons of goodwill with a racially insensitive solo debut and kept slating her ex-bandmates for headlines. “‘Cos you were all snakes no ladders / You’re happiest when you make me sadder,” Jade sings, the delicate verses and dramatic, gospel-spliced choruses echoing Billie Eilish’s deconstructed classicism.\nThe force of Jade’s presence on these songs makes it disappointing when she disappears from view. Self-Saboteur is a bit Robyn, a bit Carly; Lip Service has a nice synaptic tingle but could be by anyone from Normani to Rihanna pre-Anti. Before You Break My Heart is chunky disco based around a Supremes sample that seems like a dated vestige of the sample-pop wave from a few years ago; Silent Disco channels Midnights-era Taylor Swift, its lyrical intimacy amid gauzy synths conveying the sense of a couple shutting out the world in a crowded room.\nIt’s in these moments that the album’s title seems like a shrug: hey, them’s the breaks when you need to be playlisted on Capital FM. But in its most bravura moments, That’s Showbiz Baby! sounds Jade holding a pose breathless in the spotlight after a dazzling turn, no idea how she quite pulled it off, letting pretenders know how it’s done."

    "raw_text": "It’s customary for former girlband members to shun their manufactured roots the second they go solo. But now that Jade Thirlwall is no longer a member of Little Mix, she’s become their biggest fan. “I look back and I’m gagged at us!” she tells me, eyes wide with delight. “I still watch our music videos or performances and wonder how we weren’t even bigger, because we were fucking amazing.\n“Before I released my first solo song, I listened to Little Mix’s entire discography and cried. I was this young lass from South Shields who just wanted to make it as a singer, and I went on to be in the best, coolest girlband ever.” And now? “Now I get to have a bonus round, doing my own songs,” she beams.\nWe meet in an east London photo studio as the 32-year-old prepares to release her much-trumpeted debut solo album. Thirlwall is relaxed, funny company, in a patchwork denim jacket and oversized cargo shorts, slightly incongruous against the bouncing Diana Ross curls and frosting of bright pink freckles applied for our shoot. She’s softly spoken, her voice retaining its geordie dialect and rising in pitch whenever she’s relaying an astonishing anecdote – which is often.\nLittle Mix formed during the eighth series of The X Factor in 2011 and went on to sell 75m records, become the third-biggest girlband of all time (behind the Spice Girls and the Supremes, ahead of Destiny’s Child) and the first to spend more than 100 weeks inside the UK top 10. In 2021, they were the first girlband to win the Brit award for best British group. When Noel Gallagher claimed that they were “not in the same league as Oasis”, who had won in 1996, Thirlwall retorted that it was “a shame, really. Because we are definitely the most successful girl group in the country, but he’s not even the most successful performer in his family.”\nThis wit and swagger has been expertly parlayed into a solo career that promises to make Thirlwall Britain’s next homegrown superstar. She tells me that some of her earliest artistic influences were the drag queens of Benidorm and – in the best possible way – it shows. Her solo music and visuals are delightfully melodramatic, embracing a more-is-more approach that implies if the kitchen sink is missing, it’s only because she decided to throw in a bathtub instead.\nFour singles in, she’s flying. Her debut, Angel of My Dreams (a maximalist treatise on the agonies and ecstasies of pop fame that packs more genres than the average person’s Spotify Wrapped into three minutes and 17 seconds), was nominated for an Ivor Novello award. When she performed it at the Brit awards – dropping through a double-height trapdoor and embarking on a dizzying succession of costume changes and dance breaks before taking flight in a pair of giant angel wings – this publication described her as having stolen the show.\n“I think you should be ambitious as a pop star,” she says today. “You shouldn’t give yourself a ceiling.” In an era of reduced budgets and tightened belts, was it easy to convince her record company to let her stage an episodic performance told in five acts? “They understand that if they want me to be the next big pop girlie, then they have to put their hand in their pocket.” She adopts a mock scandalised tone: “I’m not a low‑budget artist! Give me what I need!” Their investment was rewarded when Thirlwall won best pop act.\nIt’s easy for someone white and privileged like Matty Healy to opt out of politics. Good for you, hun!\nAnother headline-generating performance followed, this time at Glastonbury festival, where Thirlwall led the Woodsies stage in a chant of “Fuck you” to, among other things, Reform, welfare cuts, silencing protest and selling arms. Was she surprised at the heated online reaction? “I was ready for a backlash from the right kind of people,” she says. “I saw a lot of people saying ‘Your Glastonbury set was really good until you got political’ or ‘I used to be a fan of yours until you got political’. But, hun, you were never a fan, because I’ve always piped up.”\nMemorably, back in 2015, Thirlwall hijacked the official Little Mix Twitter account to tweet that she was “truly saddened and ashamed” by parliament voting to bomb Isil targets in Syria. “I got in a bit of trouble for that,” she concedes cheerfully. “But I felt very passionate about it. I’m no expert in politics but I’ve always taken an interest. Around 9/11 I saw first‑hand the Islamophobia that my grandad experienced, and as someone of Arab heritage I’ve seen people turning a blind eye to the Middle Eastern tragedy. What’s quite funny is that we didn’t have individual Twitter accounts, and we each had to sign off tweets from the Little Mix account with our name. So I did my tweet about Syria and ended it with ‘xxJadexx’”.\nA stalwart defender of LGBTQ+ rights and a vocal advocate for a free Palestine, she is disparaging of artists who opt out of politics. “I don’t think you can be a pop artist and cover your eyes. I saw Matty Healy say that he doesn’t want to be political, which I found disappointing. It’s very easy for someone who’s white and straight and very privileged to say that. Good for you, hun!”\nBefore Thirlwall began making weapons-grade bangers, she was a student of pop music. Born in South Shields, she was obsessed with Madonna, Kylie and Janet Jackson, papering her wardrobe doors with moodboards of their most iconic looks. Her mum, Norma, a primary school business manager of Yemeni and Egyptian descent, had the look of Jade’s ultimate idol Diana Ross – and for a time young Jade believed her mum to be living a double life. Norma encouraged the fantasy, claiming that she was going to play concerts when, in fact, she was off down the bingo hall.\nThirlwall was always close to her mum; Norma’s at the studio with us today, and there’s a song on the forthcoming album about her mum’s ill health, which includes lupus (“She was really poorly in hospital and I thought: how can I write a really sad song that we’re all going to want to shake our tits to?”). Still, as a teenager Thirlwall felt frustrated that they rarely had deep conversations, and race wasn’t discussed. “I think my mam had suppressed that part of herself because she didn’t want to confront the trauma of her experiences of racism,” she says.\nDuring the Black Lives Matter protests, they began sharing stories and “everything clicked into place for me and I had a new understanding and empathy for what she’d been through. Where we’re from there were so many microaggressions, people calling us the P-word, that we were used to it. And in that moment we had to be like, actually it’s not OK for people to call us those things. My mam had to confront people she’d known most of her life. The right people apologise and better themselves, and you get rid of the wrong people. It was a big change for us.”\nDespite her dreams of stardom, as a child Thirlwall was shy and tomboyish. She was a victim of racist bullying at her overwhelmingly white secondary school. Coupled with the death of her beloved maternal grandfather when she was 13, this provided the catalyst, she says, for a years-long fight with anorexia. When she successfully auditioned for The X Factor aged 18 in 2011, it was just a few months after having been discharged from hospital, with doctors allowing her to compete on the proviso that she maintained a healthy weight. Wasn’t throwing herself at the mercy of Simon Cowell’s notoriously brutal juggernaut a risky strategy for someone so vulnerable?\n“In retrospect, if the show had done a proper mental health assessment, then they wouldn’t have let me on,” she says. Was there not a psych test? “It was very surface. Judging by some of the people in that X Factor house, it wasn’t done properly. Bless them, through no fault of their own, some of those people were mentally unwell. All of the female contestants slept in the same bedroom, and one of them would get up, put all her wigs out and start doing a Britney Spears performance at three in the morning. Or you’d be woken up by the sound of her using her vibrator in the middle of the night. We’d have a meeting with lawyers and someone who was obviously not in the best headspace would be picking their feet and eating it in front of everyone. It was like, ‘Is this the music industry?’”\nJesy leaving the group was incredibly painful. I wish it’d been handled differently\nIt wasn’t only the contestants enacting surreal stunts. “At one point I got led to a room in the house to get my foof waxed, which I’d never had before.” Hang on, I interrupt, why would a teenager need a bikini wax to appear on The X Factor? “I don’t know! I just remember lying with my legs akimbo, looking up at the window, thinking, ‘I hope there’s not a pap there.’”\nFor a show powered by tragic backstories, I’m surprised that Thirlwall’s anorexia wasn’t made part of her onscreen “journey”. “I made sure it wasn’t,” she says. “They’d always try to fish for a sob story, but I didn’t want that to be my identity. I was starting afresh. I thought, OK, this is a huge opportunity for me, it’s a chance to change my life.” She wanted a future bigger than her eating disorder? “Exactly. I wanted to do music more than anything, and if the only way to achieve that was to be healthy, that’s what I had to do. It was the ultimate motivation.”\nThese days, Thirlwall says that most of the negative comments she receives online are about her putting on weight. That must be incredibly difficult for a recovering anorexic? “I have a daily battle with myself not to go on Ozempic,” she says. “I don’t judge people that do, but because I have a history of eating disorders, I don’t know where taking something like that would end for me.”\nShe believes that the trolling is a depressing byproduct of reaching a broader audience. “Little Mix fans were all about empowerment and celebrating your body however you look. Now I’m in my 30s and the healthiest I’ve ever been, but every time I post a picture, there are comments saying, ‘She must be pregnant.’ The sad thing is that it’s usually women. But people are used to seeing me in a group environment five or 10 years ago when I was stick-thin because I was in my early 20s with an eating disorder.”\nDid she relapse while she was in the band? “I didn’t think it at the time, but when I look back at photos of periods when I was quite unhappy, I think, wow, girlie, you were very, very thin. The pattern was there. Historically, if I’ve ever felt that something is out of my control, then restricting food has been a means of controlling my life in a very toxic way.”\nCan she recall a time when she felt particularly out of control? “In summer 2017 I was living in a flat in east London and having really bad night terrors. I’d have such disturbing nightmares – things that are too horrific to say, dreams where I’d be harming myself – that I’d force myself to stay awake by drinking coffee and playing loud music. I’d be going to perform at outdoor concerts having not slept for days.”\nEventually her mum drove down from South Shields and took her home to the family doctor, who prescribed antidepressants. “I felt so sad, and so horrendously guilty for feeling sad. I had the fear that something awful would happen with my mam’s lupus and I wouldn’t be there. I missed family funerals and things like that, and wondered if it was all worth it.”\nShe executes a hard blink, as if resetting her thoughts, or perhaps banishing a troubling one. “That’s when my mam decided that her and her best mate would come on the road with us – it was so cute. The pair of them like Ab Fab, driving me to each venue, making sure I was fed and watered.” Did she ever consider taking a break from the group? “If you stop working in this business, then everybody wants to know why, and I couldn’t be arsed for everything that came with that. So I kept it moving.”\nThirlwall is keen to stress that she loved her time in Little Mix – loved performing, loved her bandmates. But being in a precision-engineered pop group for 10 years is not for the delicate. The band’s launch coincided with the advent of Twitter and online fandoms, meaning that the girls found themselves acting as guinea pigs in a strange new land that was yet to be mapped. At the same time, the paparazzi were still a hostile force, not yet rendered obsolete by Instagram. “We were 18 or 19 and the paps would be trying to get pictures up our skirts when we were getting into cars,” she says. “Once we were in the car, they’d try and get in with us to carry on taking pictures, which would be invasive for anyone, but especially young girls.”\nDid she ever feel scared? “Oh yeah, I was always scared,” she says with a casual air that suggests she long ago resigned herself to daily terror being the natural order of things.\nOver time, Thirlwall and fellow member Leigh-Anne Pinnock “understood that as women of colour we had to work a bit harder to be noticed”. At signings, young fans would skip past Pinnock, the darkest-skinned member of the group. “Then there was a track on our third album where the label suggested that me and Leigh-Anne not be on a song – at all. No backing vocals, nothing. Obviously when you’re a young woman and you’re told that, you’re going to feel like utter shit. We’re working just as hard, we know we can sing – what do you mean you don’t want us on the track?”\nTheir bandmates Perrie Edwards and Jesy Nelson refused to appear without them. “By halfway through our career, everyone knew not to try and separate us because we were so headstrong about always being equal. I do believe that’s the main reason we lasted so long.”\nThe band released five platinum albums in six years, a relentless pace when accompanied by the requisite tours and promotional duties. Then, in 2020, the machine ground to a halt when the UK went into lockdown. “When Covid happened it shifted everyone’s perspective on what they wanted. We already knew that our next tour would be the last for a while, but Covid was a bit of a catalyst – it was the beginning of the end in terms of the obvious dynamic shift.”\nShe’s referring to the departure of Nelson, who left the band in December 2020, saying, “I find the constant pressure of being in a girl group and living up to expectations very hard.” Nelson had been relentlessly trolled for her appearance since the advent of the group, and was hospitalised after taking an overdose in 2013. In 2019 she made a documentary called Odd One Out about these struggles. In the film, Thirlwall is shown saying, “We just had to watch this amazing, funny person become like a broken doll. It was horrible.” She later revealed that she had created a burner account on MailOnline to fire back at Nelson’s trolls.\nIn October 2020 restrictions were eased enough to allow Little Mix to film their Sweet Melody music video. By Nelson’s account, the shoot triggered a panic attack and she ended up back in hospital. “Then the girls spoke to Mum and said, ‘We think Jesy should come out of this now. She has to look after herself,’” Nelson told the Guardian in 2021. Does that fit Thirlwall’s own recollection? “Some of it, yeah. Partly.”\nIt’s obviously not a topic that she wants to dwell on, but I’m keen to understand what happened. Thirlwall has said elsewhere that the contact was “abruptly cut off”. Why so, if it was a mutual decision, with Nelson wanting to leave and the rest of the group supporting her decision? “I can’t answer that question because we weren’t the ones that did it.” Were there any attempts made to get in touch with Nelson after she’d left? “Yeah, there were, and then … yeah.”\nFor the first time our conversation stalls. Was it painful to realise that their friendship couldn’t survive Nelson leaving the group? “It was incredibly painful. For all of us that was the worst part, and it’s taken a lot of understanding and therapy and all those things to work out how that can happen when you’ve devoted so much time and love to someone. My biggest wish for that whole period is that it was handled differently. I just would’ve loved us to all sit and chat about it.\n“We absolutely adored Jesy like family – it wasn’t just work,” she continues. “We all wanted to protect her, because we understood that trauma there and what she’d been through. I think we handled it as best as we could. All of a sudden we were a member short in the middle of album promo, with everyone asking what was going on. Obviously we don’t speak any more, and things happened that I don’t think should have, but I still do feel an element of protection towards Jesy. Nobody fully understands how complex the whole thing was – it wasn’t just a case of someone wanting to leave. Numerous things built up in the last year and in the back of my mind I knew it was going to happen. I’d just like for it to have happened in a … better way.”\nOne positive to come from Nelson’s departure was the remaining members’ determination to resolve any lingering conflicts. The band had been in group therapy at the start of their career, and re-entered as a trio. “We’d seen what happened when we didn’t air things out and so there were apologies between the three of us. We all knew that we really wanted to end things on a high, still adoring each other, so we’d do whatever we had to do to achieve that.”\nThirlwall says that the group’s final – for now – tour was the most fun she’d ever had. “Anything we’d wanted to say had been said by that point and we loved each other more for it, and had more of an understanding of each other. At the end of the tour we were like, ‘Do we really want this to be the last one?’ It’s definitely not a closed door. Even now if one of us is having a bad day as a solo artist, we’re like, ‘Hello, knock, knock, is it time?!’ Not yet, but it will happen.”\nFor now, Thirlwall is laser-focused on her solo career. While Little Mix worked to a rough template – empowering songs about loving your mates and forgetting useless boyfriends – she has enjoyed exploring more nuanced themes on her album. Singles Angel of My Dreams and It Girl are inspired by her experiences in the music industry. (The former includes the lyric “Selling my soul to a psycho”, seemingly a reference to Cowell’s record label, Syco, which Little Mix were signed to until 2018. It Girl includes the lyrics “I’m not your baby doll … This bitch can’t be controlled”.) “I wanted to be tongue-in-cheek and admit that I love the game and I hate it at the same time,” she says. “It was a way to give an honest account of my experiences without being ‘woe is me’.”\nSeveral of the tracks are about her relationship with Rizzle Kicks singer Jordan Stephens. “When you’re a successful woman it’s really hard to find someone who isn’t intimidated by you or jealous of that,” she says. “When I met Jordan I wasn’t looking for anyone. Me and my best friend, Holly, were in lockdown together, and we promised ourselves a humongous dick hunt when it was over.” After being introduced to Stephens by a mutual friend, and bored of doing Zoom interviews, Thirlwall suggested they liven things up by dressing in business suits and asking each other job interview questions for their first online date. (“One of mine was, ‘Do you clap when the plane lands?’ because that’s a big ick for me.”) After their first in-person meetup, in Greenwich park, “I came home to Holly and was like, I’m so sorry, the dick hunt is over. She was fuming.”\nStephens recently published a memoir detailing his experiences of ADHD, and Thirlwall says dating someone with the disorder has been a learning curve. “When I met him I was like, why is he so messy and why is he never on time?” she says. “We had a few clashes, but it was up to me to do my research and understand his brain. Once I did that it was a turning point in our relationship because he felt loved and supported. I follow a lot of TikTok accounts for people with ADHD partners and they really have been helpful because I have a lot more patience and understanding.”\nNow the trio live together in Thirlwall’s six-bedroom house in south-east London. What’s a typical evening for the pop star, her boyfriend and her best friend since secondary school? “Whoever gets in first makes dinner. I’m not a big TV watcher, but them two love Love Island. Me and Holly are like grandmas, so we’ll sit and do a jigsaw – anything to stop me going on my phone. At the moment I’m making a Lego castle. Then there’s always a point in the evening where Jordan knows to take himself to bed because we’re going to watch Lady Gaga music videos.”\nThe Jade Thirlwall of today is galaxies away from the anxious teenager who auditioned for The X Factor – she’s firmly in control of her own story, with a record deal stipulating that she has final say on all creative decisions. Still, she’s conscious never to lose touch with the inner fangirl who dreamed of emulating her idols. “A lot of making this record has been about pleasing my younger self and tapping into that love of pop that I’ve always had,” she says. “When I’m nervous before going on stage, I picture her in the front row, reminding me not to forget that part of myself.” Young Jade was there at the Brits, on Later … With Jools Holland and at Glastonbury. “I close my eyes and imagine her telling me, ‘You’re going to kill it!’”\nAnd then? “And then I do.”"

    "raw_text": "When Jesy Nelson announced that she was leaving Little Mix last December to protect her mental health, it felt like a genuine sea change for pop. Despite fans’ understandable disappointment at her departure, her decision to take care of herself, and to speak up about the extreme pressures of life in a successful girl band – tortured by comparisons with her thinner bandmates and online abuse, including a characteristically cruel comment from Katie Hopkins that Nelson said led her to overdose – were met with wholehearted compassion and admiration. The potential for real freedom seemed to lie ahead.\nAlmost a year on, that feeling has dissipated as Nelson’s solo career – a long-teased concept finally realised today with the much-delayed release of her debut single – has succumbed to a dispiriting lack of imagination. It’s a full house of cliches. She is, as she has said in many interviews, finally making the music she wanted to make, inspired by R&B and rap, after a decade doing pop. Each new glossy cover story gracelessly twists the knife a little deeper with her former bandmates – they apparently haven’t spoken – to keep the headlines buoyant. Nelson, who won a National Television award for her 2019 documentary Odd One Out, about her mental health struggles, insists in every new interview that she is happier than ever now she is a solo artist. The latest, for Glamour UK, finds her saying she no longer needs diets and lip fillers to be happy. In the images, her midriff is toned, her lips unnaturally plump.\nI find it hard to criticise Nelson for this. She is clearly vulnerable; I hope she really is happier. These are moves drawn from a tatty old industry playbook that has never produced much in the way of success yet gets pulled out time and time again. Save for Robbie Williams, Harry Styles and Beyoncé (in a different stratosphere to her more parochial UK peers), hardly any former girl- and boyband stars have sustained the sparkle of their alma mater into a solo career. If that playbook has been upgraded, it’s to trade on the language of mental health and self-help, framing going solo as an act of emancipation and a redemption narrative. Yet it’s perfectly clear that the pressures remain the same, if not greater, out there alone without the buffer of bandmates.\nAll this might have been moot if Nelson had returned with a great song to insulate her from those pressures, but she hasn’t. Long hyped, but repeatedly pushed back apparently because guest star Nicki Minaj was too busy with her cousin’s much-disputed testicular issues to record her verses, Boyz heavily interpolates P Diddy’s 2001 hit Bad Boys for Life, and even comes with a virtual shot-for-shot remake of the video. It’s a strange decision given that most core Nelson and Little Mix fans would have been in their infancy, if born at all, when the original was released, and immediately dims the chances of Nelson establishing her own identity as a pop star. It doesn’t help that it also sounds a lot like earlier hits by another X Factor alum, Cher Lloyd.\nThe elements of the song that feel true to Nelson are its most unfortunate ones. Her vocals have an offputting helium sneer to them. Most of the time, it’s hard to understand what she’s singing. Following along with the lyrics sheet, that might be for the best. There are leg-crossing allusions to a guy liking her “raw, baby, sashimi”. It also fetishises men who are “so hood, so good, so damn taboo”, and the video shows Nelson and a coterie of Black men and women terrorising a Nice White Neighbourhood. She has frequently faced accusations of blackfishing, altering her hair, lips and skin tone to appear racially ambiguous, and singing in a blaccent. (Meanwhile, her former bandmate, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, has made her own acclaimed documentary about her experiences of racism and feeling like the least-favoured member of Little Mix.)\nIn August, Nelson told the Guardian she wasn’t aware that people felt that way and “would never want to offend anyone”. Yet her debut single toys recklessly with her assumed and unearned proximity to Black culture. In the original video, Ben Stiller cameos as an aggrieved neighbour who wants to put Diddy in his place but also suck up to and hang with him, a prescient vignette into America’s relationship to rap and to Blackness. In Nelson’s, Diddy knocks on her door, wags his finger about her delinquency, and wishes her luck. What was a funny, sharp moment is turned into a prop. (Amusingly, one outfit Nelson wears in the video, a bedazzled union jack bikini worn with a bandanna and flat-ironed hair, recalls the early looks of Victoria Beckham’s very ill-fated solo career, which also pilfered uncomfortably from rap.)\nBoyz has an odd message, too. Nelson has said that bad boys have caused her no end of romantic pain, and she wonders why she always goes for them. The lyrics could have subverted that state of affairs – digging deeper into her attraction, mocking their posturing, sending up trite gender roles – but instead they take route one. It’s dated and does her a disservice. In the video, Nelson is supposed to be a neighbourhood hellraiser, affronting good taste and staid norms. But her solo career already feels as though it’s started in a dead end."

    "raw_text": "It’s the height of the August heatwave when I sit down opposite British soprano Louise Alder in a fiercely air-conditioned central London office. We’re here to discuss her headline performance at this year’s Last Night of the Proms but, as a seasonal warmup, I ask whether she’s had a break this summer. Alder looks faintly amused, then reminds me she’s been at Glyndebourne doing three performances of Mozart’s Marriage of Figaro every week since the end of June. In fact, she was on stage as the Countess barely 12 hours earlier.\n“It’s never-ending,” she says. “I don’t want this to come across negatively – it’s been the most amazing contract – but an extremely long run. Twenty shows, which I think is the longest single run that Glyndebourne has done.” Days after the show closed, the company performed it again at the Proms. “And then a week and a half later, I come back for the Last Night.”\nAlder will be the first British singer in more than a decade to top the billing at the Last Night of the Proms. She steps into the UK’s highest-profile classical spotlight in the wake of international stars including Angel Blue, Lise Davidsen, Juan Diego Flórez and Jonas Kaufmann. It was, she giggles, “very surreal” to be invited.\nGiven that when we speak she has more Glyndebourne performances and another Proms appearance first, is the Last Night taking up much brain-space yet? “A lot. Yeah. The outfits!” she laughs, before another careful shift back to business. “And the repertoire and preparing and feeling that I’ve got everything in place to be as calm as possible.”\nAlder came to singing relatively late. After playing the violin and oboe as a child, she started to tread the boards in plays, musicals and operas at university but only began intensive voice training as a postgraduate at the Royal College of Music. Now 38 and back in London after almost a decade at the Frankfurt Opera, she has become one of the most sought-after British singers of her generation. You’ll find her on major operatic stages across the UK and Europe, in recital programmes with regular collaborator Joseph Middleton and on several critically acclaimed recordings. In November she will make her debut at New York’s Metropolitan Opera, in Strauss’s Arabella.\nShe has suffered nerves ever since winning the Dame Joan Sutherland audience prize at the 2017 Cardiff Singer of the World competition. “Once you start feeling that people have expectations, that’s when the nerves come, because you feel you’ve got something to lose. I have to say to myself that what we do is not brain surgery. It doesn’t matter if something goes wrong. No one is going to die! But we feel like we let ourselves down, or rather we let the crowd and the people who support us down – and that’s hard.”\nShe has been doing some visualisation, she tells me. It helps that she already knows what it feels like to sing at the Royal Albert Hall; since her debut there, in another Glyndebourne performance, of Strauss’s Der Rosenkavalier in 2014, she has performed at numerous Proms and knows the venue’s acoustic well. “It’s always a challenge. I’ve done very intimate things like the Bach St Matthew Passion – and you really want to sing on a knife-edge of piano. But … you have 6,000 people and a huge auditorium to get across to, and yet you also have a microphone right in front of your face – these things are extremely different! And it’s even more extreme when it’s televised.”\nSo how is Alder feeling about standing there, looking out on a sea of flags and inflatables? “The atmosphere is going to be infectious – I can’t wait!” She’s also excited about the music she will be singing (including a number from Lehár’s operetta The Merry Widow – “if anyone ever offered me some musical theatre or more operetta, I would love that!”) and thrilled to be part of the evening’s all-female lineup alongside trumpeter Alison Balsom, conductor Elim Chan and commissioned composers Camille Pépin and Rachel Portman.\nBut what about performing Rule, Britannia!, the Thomas Arne number that has featured annually on the programme since 1953? The unabashed imperialism of its lyrics has proved controversial in recent years, most recently when cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the first Black winner of the BBC Young Musician competition, pointed out that the song makes many people feel “uncomfortable”. When I ask Alder about its inclusion, she says without hesitation: “It’s genuinely an honour for me to sing at the Last Night and be part of that and the history.” Case closed, I assume. But a moment later, she adds with sudden feeling: “We want to entice people in to watch the concert – with the traditions – and to make people from every background feel comfortable to watch.”\nOn other matters, Alder is more explicit. She is open about the challenges of being a travelling musician as well as a parent of a toddler (she and her horn-player husband “do juggling of childcare as our bread and butter”) and has since announced that she’s expecting their second child. She returned to work just nine weeks after giving birth to their first. “I watched my bank balance disappear – I had to go back,” she shrugs. “People asked, ‘How much maternity leave are you taking?’ And I thought, ‘I don’t have any – that isn’t a thing.’” She’s adamant that more support is needed in general for freelancers. “We saw this in the pandemic – it was abysmal.”\nBrexit, meanwhile, happened while Alder was still living in Germany – “a huge shock to all of us in the artistic community” – and “does make our lives [as musicians] more difficult. That’s just a fact.” She still works regularly in Europe, and admits that, when she coaches young singers, “I do advise them to go abroad. Given the situation funding-wise in this country, we don’t have a choice. There isn’t enough work or money in the arts here.”\nBy this time, the rhetorical safety catch is off and Alder is fluently frustrated. The crisis around the funding of professional opera choruses in the UK is “heartbreaking”: compared to when she was at college “only just over a decade ago, the cultural landscape is completely decimated”. Her daughter’s nursery does lots of music, but “as soon as they go to school, there’s almost nothing”. And yet, Alder insists, “music is imperative for us at a molecular level. It’s the thing that everyone turned to in the pandemic. It’s what we turn to for comfort. It broadens the mind. We’re losing the heart of our nation by starving the arts and culture.”"

    "raw_text": "When Glyndebourne opened its doors in 1934, it did so with The Marriage of Figaro, the first in a fabled line of productions of Mozart’s comic masterpiece to grace its stages over the last 90 years. If the director Mariame Clément felt any pressure, it didn’t show. Hers is a nuanced staging that manages to be astute, funny and moving all at once. It’s also extremely well sung.\nThe opera is about many things, but a great deal hinges on the ancient concept of droit de seigneur, a barbaric medieval custom whereby a feudal lord was entitled to have sex with a female servant on her wedding night. Mozart’s Count, we learn, has made a show of ending the tradition, though he still hopes to bed the feisty Susanna, maidservant to his estranged Countess. Clément sets the show in its original period, allowing its parallels to resonate across the centuries with today’s audiences, and so they do.\nThere is a powerful interrogation of character here: the determination and resourcefulness of Susanna, the aching loneliness of the Countess, and the testosterone-fuelled antagonism that develops between the Count and his increasingly implacable manservant, Figaro. Revolutionary feelings erupt at several points. Whether or not he prevails in his immediate sexual depredations, the Count’s days are plainly numbered. He might join in the final outburst of bonhomie, but as a predator his career is in tatters.\nClément is clearly blessed with funny bones, as are most of her singers. At the opening of Act III, we hear the Count’s voice, seemingly from off stage. Moments later, as a wriggling foot emerges over its rim, we realise he was submerged in the bathtub all along. The fistfuls of documents concealed under Marcelina’s voluminous skirts, the rogue’s gallery of doddery old men, and a hastily improvised game of rock paper scissors all receive well-earned laughs.\nJulia Hansen’s rotating sets are a marvel, presenting a labyrinthine succession of pastel-painted rooms, corridors and gardens. Equally eye-catching are her vibrant costumes and Paule Constable’s atmospheric lighting, which never fails to pick out a face. Riccardo Minasi drives the score hard, though his flexible beat is always alert to the drama. The playing of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment is exhilarating, though balance is sometimes an issue.\nThe cast is led by Johanna Wallroth’s sparky Susanna and Louise Alder’s radiant Countess. The latter delivers an immaculate account of Porgi amor and a poignantly staged Dove sono. Michael Nagl is an appealingly bumptious Figaro, Huw Montague Rendall a preening, raptor-like Count, and Adèle Charvet engaging and entirely convincing as the reluctantly cross-dressed Cherubino. As Bartolo and Marcelina, Alessandro Corbelli and Madeleine Shaw are surprisingly tender in the paternity scene, another of Clément’s many thoughtful touches.\nAt Glyndebourne until 21 August\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "If programming the Proms as a whole is a balancing act, the Last Night has its own extra challenges, not all of them connected to culture wars. Is it a live event that happens to be televised, or a TV broadcast with a live audience? This year, long pauses between short pieces meant that, for the first hour or so, there was almost as much waiting as music – making time for pre-recorded interviews on the TV broadcast but stretching patience in the hall, despite the relishable quality of the BBCSO’s playing and the bonhomie radiated by its conductor Sakari Oramo. Plus the piano was rolled on near the end of the first half and off during the second, which, for all the efficiency of the Proms stage staff, is no Formula 1 pitstop.\nStill, that piano, or the person playing it, provided several of the evening’s highlights. As well as joining the US soprano Angel Blue in his own arrangement of two Spirituals, Stephen Hough was a nuanced soloist in Saint-Saëns’s ‘Egyptian’ Concerto – the second movement only, sadly – creating something magical with the composer’s other-worldly overtone effects. This would have been a sober end to the first half had he not followed it as an encore with his own dazzlingly playful fantasia on Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\nBlue, who was fulfilling a childhood dream by singing here, was on velvet-voiced form in two Puccini arias plus a flirty Spanish operetta number by Ruperto Chapì, delivered while lobbing roses into the audience, before returning to lead Rule, Britannia. Once again, the “azure main” she sang about might have referred to the sea of EU flags joining the union jacks and others throughout the hall.\nAs well as a couple of worthwhile Proms firsts – a bittersweet part song by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, beautifully delivered by the BBC Singers, and Grace Williams’s elegant Fantasia on Welsh Nursery Tunes – there were two more premieres. Carlos Simon’s Hellfighters’ Blues paid tribute to the pioneering Black musicians of the 369th Infantry Regiment band in a joyful collision of blues and march, with a louchely jazzy starring turn for the BBCSO’s principal trumpet. And, following a sporting theme begun earlier by Charles Ives’s almost surreal orchestral depiction of the Yale-Princeton Football Game, Iain Farrington’s Extra Time was a mash-up of all the BBC’s sports theme tunes: a fluffy but inspired bit of Last Night silliness that had the BBC Symphony Chorus starting a huge Mexican wave."

    "raw_text": "I’m pretty sure the man who’s very politely shunting Lise Davidsen out of our Royal Opera House interview room to make way for an audit meeting doesn’t recognise her, but perhaps that’s not so surprising. Davidsen is simultaneously one of the company’s biggest draws this season and a relatively new face on the international stage. It may be that the casting of Jonas Kaufmann as Florestan ensured the ROH’s new production of Fidelio, staged by Tobias Kratzer, sold out within 24 hours, but for many it’s the prospect of Davidsen as Leonore – Beethoven’s courageous, cross-dressing, husband-rescuing heroine – that’s generating the real excitement.\nDavidsen was virtually unknown in 2015 when she swept the board at Operalia, the competition that has helped launch the careers of Nina Stemme, Sonya Yoncheva and many others. Her performance in the final was a sensation: here was a fully fledged, radiant voice big enough to soar over a Wagnerian orchestra, coming out of the mouth of a singer aged only 28. Yet while her voice and her height – she is nearly 6 foot 2 – might have led some to imagine her as the Valkyrie incarnate, she has chosen her roles more wisely than that, saving Brünnhilde and Isolde and the other big, potentially voice-destroying roles for later, and instead choosing either supporting roles in big houses or leading roles in small ones. Her UK stage debut, as Strauss’s Ariadne at Glyndebourne in 2017, was, according to the Times’s Neil Fisher, “one of those ‘I was there’ moments”; in the Observer, Fiona Maddocks wrote that hers was “one of the greatest voices I have heard”. Leonore will be her first starring role in London.\nIn interview, Davidsen is unassuming, direct and straightforward: not so different, you imagine, from the handball-playing girl she was in the small town of Stokke in rural Norway. She started singing with any seriousness only when she was 15, went to music college in Bergen, and was all set for a career in baroque music as a mezzo-soprano when, as a postgraduate in Copenhagen, her teacher spotted her potential as an operatic soprano. “I knew I had those high notes, but they were there in a very childish, undeveloped way. I thought, OK, I’ll have to work for this, I’ll put in whatever it takes.”\nSuccess followed rapidly, but her new lifestyle took some getting used to. “My brother and sister have normal jobs and families, and I thought I was going to do that too – to live in one place and just sing. I really wanted what I do now, but it took me time to get here, to include myself in it, in a way.” Last year saw the release of her first solo disc, a garlanded debut at the Met in New York and her first role at Bayreuth, the hallowed festival that takes place in Wagner’s own opera house. It was, she says, “the first year where I actually enjoyed some of it, some of the circus. Until then I had been so afraid. Everything had been so new: the constant travelling, never being at home, but trying to find a way to be a normal person, to still be with friends and family.”\nThe fact that she’s now returning to places rather than going from debut to debut makes things a little easier, she says, and she has learned to trust the people she works with. Before, she felt uncomfortable accepting engagements years in advance – what if her voice changed and she had to let people down? “My agent told me, ‘say yes to what you think you will do, and everyone will understand that life and the voice will develop. It’s a two-way communication.’ Now I trust that communication much more. I trust that a conductor is there to actually help me. The pressure from the audience gets higher and higher, but you feel more comfortable with the people you work with. I’m now starting to see how this will be my life.”\nThis morning they have been rehearsing Kratzer’s staging of the overture, in which the shadow of the guillotine looms large – Beethoven’s only opera is highly political, with liberté, égalité, fraternité themes, and a heroine whose music expresses her fears as vividly as her resolve. Leonore is quite a different role to Davidsen’s Wagnerian heroines, who have integrity and depth but little agency. “She’s so unselfish, which I like, so determined. So many female roles have this compassion, this determination for love, but in terms of actions it’s quite different. It’s nice to play a really good woman!”\nKratzer’s Bayreuth production of Tannhäuser, which began with Venus (on screen) in a Citroën driving her entourage to Burger King, was provocative but mostly enthusiastically received. Not that Davidsen read the reviews. ‘I don’t believe reviews are written for me, nor do I believe they’re giving me anything. I know exactly when I leave the stage what I did right and what I did wrong. No matter what’s written, I’ll have to go back on stage in a couple of days anyway, and I want to make sure that performance number two, three, four is just as important as number one.”\nAfter Leonore she will be going back into the recording studio for her second solo disc – the repertoire is still under wraps – and then back to Bayreuth for more Wagner: Elisabeth in Tannhaüser again, and Sieglinde in the Ring. The next few years are set to bring more Strauss and some Verdi – Don Carlo, La forza del destino and Un ballo in maschera. But one date that is always in her diary is the next concert back in Stokke, where she has a loyal following. “They support me in this unconditional way,” she says. “I love it! It’s like a team.” Twenty-five of them, she says, came over to New York to see her debut there. Will they be in the audience for Fidelio too? “No, it sold out too quickly! But they will watch it at the cinema in Sandefjord.”\nA few days after we speak, Davidsen is on stage at the Barbican, giving a recital with the pianist James Baillieu, in which she speaks several times to the audience about what she’s going to sing. She doesn’t yet own the stage, but she looks as though she knows she’s among friends, and the audience loves her for it. “It’s a huge irony that I’m an opera singer because I could never see myself on stage. I was so insecure.” Previously she’s talked about having something resembling impostor syndrome – “but I do now feel I have a reason to be there. In many ways I’m still a private person, but the stage has become this space of mine where I can be someone else or tell a story or communicate something. What I was so afraid of has become my safe space – it’s interesting how it turned out to be the complete opposite of what I feared.”\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "In the end, it didn’t happen: the Last Night of the Proms didn’t descend into a Brexit v EU flag-off; no punches were thrown during Land of Hope and Glory. Certainly the EU flags were more prominent than usual, but as ever they jostled with stripes and crosses and emblems from all around the world – to decipher them all one would need to invent Shazam for flags. In the arena, two of the Prommers most ostentatiously dressed head to-toe in union jacks were visiting Germans, and the biggest, brightest flag of all belonged to Tibet. It’s a mistake to think of the Last Night as an exclusively British thing.\nInstead, in a way, it’s more of a fancy-dress party. Nobody understood that better than Juan Diego Flórez, the Peruvian star tenor, who came on for Rule Britannia dressed as an Inca warrior complete with blue and orange feathered headdress and gold earrings as big as beermats, and brandishing an axehead on a staff. Flórez had already all but stolen the show with his high notes, agility and wit in arias by Rossini, Offenbach and Donizetti, and, with a microphone, with his smooth delivery of a medley of Latin numbers – the smoochiest of which was addressed to the cuddly toy Paddington (also a Peruvian guest in London) he’d been handed from the arena. The BBC Symphony Orchestra did a good impression of a Cuban backing band.\nOtherwise the programming was on the bland side, ticking many of this year’s boxes – Shakespeare, the Olympics, the Somme anniversary – without offering anything very substantial. The BBC Symphony Chorus showed their considerable mettle in the Polovtsian Dances from Borodin’s Prince Igor, but you would not have guessed from the recent works by Jonathan Dove and Michael Torke that the Proms can be a staunch supporter of challenging new music as well as the more instantly palatable stuff. Raze, the brand new opener commissioned from the young composer Tom Harrold for the BBC Proms Youth Ensemble, had a pounding energy driving its low, insistent string fragments, but was over in five minutes.\nStill, it was good to have 16 of the UK’s up and coming singers showcased, however briefly, in Vaughan Williams’s Serenade to Music, and to hear anthems from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland shoehorned in to the Fantasia on British Sea Songs, rescuing the night’s balance from its usual English-heavy setting. Conductor Sakari Oramo dutifully avoided mentioning Brexit in his speech, but nobody can have doubted what he was alluding to when he quoted Shakespeare’s Lorenzo, in The Merchant of Venice, talking of music’s ability to tame wild beasts and warring opponents into “a mutual stand”.\nThe serious musical sign-off for the season had come the evening before, when Marin Alsop drove the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment through the Verdi Requiem. The chorus was the BBC Proms Youth Choir, its 277 singers drawn from a few of the country’s best youth and university choirs, and after a whispered beginning the sound these young massed voices made in the first loud entry was tremendous, especially from the men. Up in the gallery, the OAE’s offstage trumpets ricocheted around the hall in the Dies Irae, and the onstage ones crackled over the top of Verdi’s thickly woven orchestral textures throughout. Morris Robinson brought lots of personality to the bass solos, but the star of the solo quartet was soprano Tamara Wilson, whose Libera Me was a gleaming, incisive, and rooted in stillness.\n- Available on iPlayer to watch or listen again until 9 October.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Two summers ago, Marin Alsop at the Last Night of the Proms was big news: a female conductor! Giving the Last Night speech! Passing over the unfortunate truth that Alsop is likely to be the only woman conducting the event for the next few years, her return felt like a homecoming: few conductors would be so much at ease in a programme ranging from Strauss’s Till Eulenspiegel to Arvo Pärt to The Sound of Music, at an event that feels like an anachronism and yet comes with the opportunity to make a political point.\nAlsop’s speech included a call for redoubled efforts to level the conducting playing field for men and women, and some insistent but not over-idealistic words on music’s potential to improve the world – all this to a hall bedecked with the usual flags plus, on one box, a banner saying Refugees Welcome.\nGerman flags were waved with extra pride – and not only because of tenor Jonas Kaufmann’s singing in arias by Puccini and Lehár, though that would have justified it. He brought his glowing Recondita Armonia to a gloriously controlled close, sang a barnstorming Nessun Dorma – and was rewarded from the arena with at least two pairs of knickers and one of boxer shorts, all of which might be a Proms first.\nOther highlights were mostly courtesy of pianist Benjamin Grosvenor, a crisp and buoyant soloist in Shostakovich’s Concerto No 2 and in James P Johnson’s Victory Stride – which also featured stylish solos from within the BBC Symphony Orchestra – and the salon pianist of dreams in Percy Grainger’s solo arrangement of Gershwin’s Love Walked In.\nEleanor Alberga’s new, three-minute opener Arise, Athena! fitted the occasion – easy on the ear yet rhythmically forceful, and involving orchestra and organ plus the massed ranks of the BBC Singers and Symphony Chorus. Arvo Pärt’s 80th birthday was marked with his Credo, an earlier, less reflective work than we usually associate with him, in which cacophonous forces of evil are dispelled by the calm and goodness of Bach’s C major Prelude, played by BBCSO pianist Elizabeth Burley.\nUpping the already high opera-star glamour count, soprano Danielle de Niese flirted with the gallery in Delibes’s Les Filles de Cadix and, before all the usual flagwaving shenanigans, led the hall in a mass singalong medley from The Sound of Music. To her credit, Alsop kept things moving even in Edelweiss, which the audience would otherwise have milked more than Christopher Plummer would have ever dreamed of. Sometimes, conducting is not about musical inspiration so much as crowd control.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Here’s a really lovely disc from two of classical song’s brightest artists. The soprano Louise Alder and pianist Joseph Middleton start with Rachmaninov and end with Britten, taking in Sibelius, Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Medtner on the way; the music’s geographical progress mirrors the journey Alder’s great-grandparents made as refugees in 1916, from Odessa to Finland, Norway and finally Britain. Alder describes it as a “meandering sleigh ride”, though if that conveys the unhurried way in which these well-chosen songs lead into one another it doesn’t quite do justice to the focus with which they come across. Alder is in glorious voice, her soprano fresh and untethered; the assurance of youth and the doubt born of experience come across equally convincingly. Her high notes gleam, and her words are direct and communicative, whether in Russian, Swedish, German or French.\nMiddleton’s playing fills in everything those words can’t say, perfectly calibrated to support Alder but huge in its expressive scope. There will be discoveries here for all but the most dedicated song aficionados, from Rachmaninov’s dreamy sensuousness and Sibelius’s melancholic ardour, to Tchaikovsky’s French numbers, which have an arch, almost salon-ish tinge. Grieg’s The Discreet Nightingale finds Alder and Middleton revelling quietly in the refrain’s delicious, knowing languor. Then there are two songs by Nikolai Medtner: a sparkling Mailied full of expectancy and the ominous Meeresstille that’s clearly about a loneliness more universal than that of the becalmed sailor of Goethe’s poem. The title track is the final song in Britten’s Pushkin cycle The Poet’s Echo, in which Middleton’s piano traces an eerie tick-tocking around Alder’s searching vocal line: a haunting end to a disc you will want to play again right away.\nThis week’s other pick\nWith Sheku Kanneh-Mason’s new disc nudging along just below Stormzy in the Top 10, you can’t move for commentators simultaneously worrying he’s being pushed too far too soon and bemoaning the fact that he’s not Jacqueline du Pré. True, this performance of Elgar’s Cello Concerto doesn’t quite ignite, but that’s perhaps as much to do with a lack of fruitful tension between soloist and orchestra – the LSO, under Simon Rattle – as with the thoughtful playing of Kanneh-Mason himself. The rest of the disc, involving a roomful of chamber-music partners, taking in haunting Bloch and Bridge and ending with Julius Klengel’s lush Hymnus for 12 cellos, is an old-school potpourri that works beautifully.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "In May, reviews of Glyndebourne's new production of Der Rosenkavalier triggered a media storm about sexism. But the reviews also discerned a musical coolness in the production. Now, two months later, in this semi-staged rendering for Glyndebourne's annual Prom visit, many of those reservations can be set aside.\nThat may be because Richard Jones's iconoclastic production had to be severely scaled back for the Albert Hall. But the principal reason is musical. Robin Ticciati conducted with a sure feel for the ebb and flow of Strauss's score, and with the London Philharmonic rearranged in front of the staging, orchestral colours were vividly pointed. The offstage band at the start of act three, often muddily distant in the theatre, has rarely sounded so interesting.\nIt didn't hurt, either, that illness to two key principals meant that Franz Hawlata, no less, stepped in to sing Baron Ochs and Louise Alder to sing Sophie. Arguably the leading exponent of the role in the world at the moment, Hawlata brought hugely assured vocal presence and a practised feel for this opera's all-important text to the performance. And if Alder did not impose herself to the same degree, her bright and well-supported soprano was a constant reward.\nOne of the benefits of a concert performance – with the lights up – is the chance to follow Hugo von Hofmannstahl's text closely. Kate Royal's Marschallin was a revelation in this and other respects. Over the Glyndebourne run, she has grown into the great role, delivering the Marschallin's idiomatic German with a fresh, creamy tone and a Straussian poise that mark this as a signature role for her career. The wry final-act confession of prejudice against men was a moment to treasure.\nLike Royal, Tara Erraught has also grown increasingly confident as Octavian and, if it is not her fault that the Mariandel scenes overstay their welcome, she more than compensated by producing the necessary Octavian ardour in the set pieces and impressive vocal command in ensembles.\nExtraordinary that this was the first complete Rosenkavalier at the Proms. On this evidence, it works a treat in the Albert Hall.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "I was starting to stress about where I could hire a tuxedo from when my editor reassured me. “You don’t have to wear black tie to the Proms!” she laughed. No, not even a suit. Anything is fine, she said. “Really?” I asked, doubtful. My perception of the Last Night of the Proms – a bunch of toffs in dinner jackets braying about Empire, a kind of musical Bullingdon Club – was clearly off the mark. What else had I been getting wrong about it?\nMany things, it turns out. Not only is black tie not mandatory but the Proms finale revels in what can only be described as “some seriously strong lewks”. On the hottest day of the year, nobody bats an eyelid at the strapping bald man who is topless save for a sparkly union jack waistcoat and bowtie, nor at the daring decision of one man to combine dress shoes (no socks) and shorts. “Look over there,” I whisper to my wife, pointing towards a couple sat to our right. “Rabbit people.” A man and woman are wearing strap-on noses and ears as if they’ve arrived straight from the set of the Wicker Man. Clearly, anything goes here.\nWas I also wrong to have expected a slightly unpleasant nationalistic vibe? In the past, Guardian reviews have compared the Last Night of the Proms to hooliganism and even the Nuremberg rallies. It’s true there are plenty of union flags being waved tonight, but they’re easily outnumbered by the EU ones that have been handed out to punters outside for free – a smart bit of guerilla marketing by anti-Brexit campaigners.\nThe Last Night of the Proms is undeniably very silly. People let off streamers, throw around huge rave smiley balloons and one person seems to have brought their own parping horn for the sea shanties segment. Everyone “oohs” when the light-up wristbands we’re given at the start blink into action. And when balloons are let off, there is a growing cheer as they fly up towards the ceiling before finally fizzling out. But before all that, the music gets a very decent hearing. This year’s programme has an elegiac quality, softer and less bombastic than the music I was expecting, and – especially when it came to the first Proms airing of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s Deep River – more soulful too. As a pop writer, I enjoy picking out where the likes of Ennio Morricone and Sufjan Stevens might have nabbed a few of their ideas from.\nThe Last Night has had a pretty awful run in recent years. In 2020 it went without an audience due to the pandemic, and was the subject of a tedious culture war regarding whether or not the words for Rule, Britannia! should be sung. A year later things had improved, although the choirs were still restricted by social distancing guidelines. Last year looked set to be trouble-free, until the death of the Queen prompted its last-minute cancellation. I half worried that the organisers would announce that RAAC had been detected in the Royal Albert Hall’s ceiling this year.\nIn truth, it’s hard to attend an event with such patriotic trappings without thinking about the state of the nation. Outside this glorious building is a nation in decline. Schools can’t open, hospitals can’t cope with demand and you can’t swim in the rivers without encountering human waste. Tonight could have felt like the establishment squirrelled away in a building, enjoying their opulence. Instead it feels more like a shifting of the national mood. The energetic conductor Marin Alsop – the first woman to conduct the last night, back in 2013 – gives a speech about diversity and bridging the gender gap. There are numerous pride flags. Yes, the audience is still overwhelmingly white, but the highlight for me is soloist Sheku Kanneh-Mason’s gorgeous cello playing, and there is rapturous applause when the spotlight lands on James B Wilson, whose 1922 (originally intended for 2022’s Last Night) was composed in honour of the BBC’s centenary.\nFor all the hot air from the government and their culture war proxies regarding Proms traditions and what it means to be British, they’re the ones delivering swingeing cuts to the arts and the BBC, apparently blind to their value beyond how they can be used for political gain. As the final traditional segment of patriotic bangers rings outs – Land of Hope and Glory! Jerusalem! – and a swarm of EU flags wave during Rule, Britannia!, there’s a different, more hopeful kind of patriotism being displayed here. It’s doubtful I’ll ever be donning the rabbit ears or sparkly Union Jack waistcoat, but I wouldn’t say no to coming back."

    "raw_text": "The Last Night of the Proms doesn’t appeal to me, but Joseph Harker goes way over the top in calling it a “supremacist indulgence” (The Rule, Britannia! row is too important for anti-racists to ignore, 2 September). No doubt this eccentric event shelters a proportion of Tories, Brexiters and Faragists, but I flatly refuse to believe that the average concertgoer, admittedly mostly white, is the thoughtless racist that Harker’s piece seems to imply.\nThe promenaders I know are music lovers first and foremost; thoroughly decent people, often on the left, often members of minority groups, who deplore racism in all its forms. But on one night a year, they sing their hearts out to some rather silly songs that many of them have known since childhood and which reflect nothing more than a slightly infantile, and probably tipsy, affection for their country – OK, the country as it was, rather than how it now is. But surely they have the right to do that now and again without being smeared as evil oppressors of their fellow citizens.\nAs a supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, what worries me most about pieces such as Harker’s is the fuel they risk pouring on the fires of rightwing populism, creating a backlash that drives yet more people into the arms of Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings. It’s those two who are the real supremacists that we progressives should worry about, not a bunch of half-pissed flag wavers in the Royal Albert Hall.\nAlan Clark\nLondon\nHow sad that public opinion can reverse a decision on a fairly trivial matter (BBC says words to Rule, Britannia! will now be sung at Proms, 2 September), but the demotion of the Department for International Development – the record of which on helping to reduce world poverty is genuinely “world-beating” – to a subsidiary of the Foreign Office goes ahead.\nPeter Wrigley\nBirstall, West Yorkshire\nGeorge Orwell, in his essay on Charles Dickens, says that when people feel a “sneaking affection for the patriotic poems … learned by heart as a child”, it is “not so much the poems themselves as the memories they call up”. This could also explain our fondness for the patriotic songs at the Last Night of the Proms.\nMarie Paterson\nNuneaton, Warwickshire\nJoin the conversation – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com"

    "raw_text": "A British cellist who played at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex has said Rule, Britannia! “makes people feel uncomfortable” and should not be sung at the Last Night of the Proms.\nSheku Kanneh-Mason, who became the first black person to win the BBC Young Musician award in 2016, performed as a soloist at the final concert of the annual two-month orchestral event last year – but said he did not stay to hear Rule, Britannia! being sung at the end of the night.\nThe patriotic song ignited controversy in 2020 when the Sunday Times reported that the BBC was discussing ditching Rule, Britannia! at that year’s Proms.\nWhile many embraced the opportunity to discuss alternatives with more universal appeal, traditionalists expressed dismay at what was perceived to be an attack on British culture.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Kanneh-Mason said he did not think the song should be included in Last Night of the Proms, and that “so much wonderful music” could replace it.\n“I think maybe some people don’t realise how uncomfortable a song like that can make a lot of people feel, even if it makes [the people singing it] feel good,” he said. “I think that’s somehow a big misunderstanding about it.”\nKanneh-Mason suggested the song could be replaced with British folk music: “There is so much wonderful British music. The wealth of folk music from this country is astonishing.\n“There is so much that is worth celebrating and having as part of a big celebration at the end of a wonderful music festival.”\nResponding to Kanneh-Mason’s comments, a BBC spokesperson said: “The Proms are built on longstanding traditions that were established by co-founder Sir Henry Wood, and which are loved by people around the world.\n“One of these traditions is the last night festivities. Other traditions include promoting new music, accessibility and opening up the world of classical music to as many people as possible.”\nKanneh-Mason, who was born and raised in Nottingham, appeared alongside his siblings on the ITV variety show Britain’s Got Talent in 2015.\nHis album Inspiration, which was reported in February 2018 to have been “the biggest-selling British debut of the year to date”, reached No 1 on the UK classical albums chart."

    "raw_text": "On a trip to see his grandparents in the Indian city of Allahabad, journalist Sunny Bhatia flicks through the morning papers, and is immediately at sea: what can the convoluted sentences before him – “TTIM files complaint against MSL at JM Rastra. MP(LTTK) holds GL Mukti strike to blame for Vasudev debacle. BORS reverberates in KLM(U) case” – possibly mean? His bewilderment at an India he cannot decode is, equally problematically, mirrored by the incomprehension he experiences in New York, where he occupies a junior role at the Associated Press.\nFortunately, there are other more readily accessible stories: a woman sold at a cattle fair in Rajasthan, and a retired railway clerk in Mysore who has grown his fingernails so long that they reach across the room and oblige his family to attend to his every physical need. They do not mind, the clerk tells Sunny when he interviews him over the phone, because they understand his determination to do something that nobody else has done: “The point is not about having longer fingernails than anyone; what is important is that I am firing up the younger generation to be ambitious. If I can do it, I tell them, I who used to have no discipline, then you can also reach your dream of fame.”\nThe story is, Sunny realises, excellent copy, even if his piece enrages the long-nailed man, who deems him an outsider pretending to be an insider, and a cheating outsider at that. There’s an echo of Desai’s own experience of writing her debut novel, 1998’s Hullabaloo in the Guava Orchard, which drew on the apparently true story of a man who lived up a tree for 15 years to escape an unhappy marriage, and which roused the ire of the Nepali community she depicted. The irresolvable tension of the insider/outsider’s life ran through her Booker prize-winning second novel, The Inheritance of Loss, and is reprised in each of the multiple storylines in this mammoth novel, which has also been longlisted for the Booker.\nCritically, it is a novel about work as much as it is about the relationship between Sunny and Sonia Shah, whose families are neighbours and whose attempts to make a match begin their on-off liaison. Where Sunny dreams of journalistic success, albeit heavily inflected by the work of JD Salinger and Kurt Vonnegut, Sonia’s heart and mind lie in writing fiction. Alienated and alone at college in rural Vermont, she finds solace in Tolstoy, but is perplexed and provoked by the idea of magic realism and “the enticement of white people by route of peacocks, monsoons, exotic-spice bazaars”. The dilemma facing an Indian writer, she ponders, is one of obeisance to the west’s appetites and projections, and the lure of producing “stories cheapened by proliferation, decorative outside and hollow inside”.\nDesai’s solution to the problem in this immensely entertaining and generative novel is to dart continually between modes of representation and register. The gothic novel appears with the early introduction of the monstrous Ilan de Toorjen Foss, a narcissistic artist who seduces Sonia, suppresses her literary endeavours and then abandons her (“don’t write orientalist nonsense! Don’t cheapen your country or people will think that this is actually India … What Westerners did to you, you are doing to yourself”). The predicaments and predilections of Sunny and Sonia’s Allahabad relatives create a low-key bourgeois comedy: stranded single aunts, genteel impoverishment, the wrangle over a cook famed for his kebabs. These are reprised in higher style by Sunny’s widowed mother, the impossibly grand Babita, who is embroiled in a noir crime plot by the machinations of her late husband’s brothers and whose preoccupation with wealth and status cast light on the rapidly evolving strata of contemporary urban India.\nIn the interstices of the discrete and distinctive tones of each of these narrative components, the novel allows itself to succumb to a wild and suggestive indeterminacy, conveyed through various iterations of Sunny and Sonia’s internal monologues, sometimes rational and ruminative, sometimes operatic and hallucinatory. Sonia “dreamt the walls leaked blood. She dreamt she ate a pie, and when she bit into it, the pie leaked blood. She dreamt she had a hideous baby and it died, and when she cut it open with scissors, it was not a baby at all – it had a child’s head but a lizard’s skeleton.” Such nightmarish visions are not confined to sleep, particularly when a marauding dog enters the story to pursue her.\nCapacious and shape-shifting though the novel is, filled with subtexts and shadow narratives, it is still a challenge to hold the contradictions and demands of multiple identities. Desai pictures Sonia and her father listening to the Pakistani singer Iqbal Bano, and reflecting on what the music conjures in them: “To be a citizen of a troubled postcolonial nation gave a person gravitas. To be holding out against the crass new world gave a man gravitas. To be wounded yet fighting on against the barbarians gave one gravitas. To be exiled, abandoned by love and luck, gave them gravitas. What happened within a family, what happened between a couple, was no different from that which happened in a nation under dictatorship, running on fear.”\nWhether or not a novel can accurately and productively capture this yearning for gravitas, or the continuum between the personal and the political, is one of the questions posed by The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny. Another is the sheer exhaustion – mental, physical and artistic – caused by the constant need for self-invention and reinvention, whether individual, societal, national or global; and how the form of the novel, created in the European consciousness, can complexify itself to take account of an accelerated, fractured modernity. Desai’s answer to these questions is to make her story both dizzyingly vast and insistently miniature; to make us feel that there is as much at stake in the lives of Vini-Puri, a pair of servant girls in Babita’s household not even accorded single-name recognition, as in the grand ambitions of the novel’s title characters. She pulls it off, not only in her manoeuvring of cast and incident, but in her ability to elicit apprehension, laughter, compassion and curiosity in the reader."

    "raw_text": "The Inheritance of Loss\nby Kiran Desai\n336pp, Hamish Hamilton, £16.99\nThis impressive novel, longlisted for the Man Booker prize, produces a strange effect. It is a big novel that stretches from India to New York; an ambitious novel that reaches into the lives of the middle class and the very poor; an exuberantly written novel that mixes colloquial and more literary styles; and yet it communicates nothing so much as how impossible it is to live a big, ambitious, exuberant life. Everything about it dramatises the fact that although we live in this mixed-up, messy, globalised world, for many people the dominant response is fear of change, based on a deep desire for security.\nThe Inheritance of Loss is set in the Himalayas, \"where India blurred into Bhutan and Sikkim ... it had always been a messy map\". A young Indian girl, Sai, lives with her grandfather, a retired judge, in a damp and crumbling house. Sai has started a relationship with her Nepalese maths tutor, Gyan. But, unknown to her, Gyan has become seduced by a group of Nepalese insurgents, some of whom are, as the book opens, marching to Sai's house to steal food, Pond's Cold Cream, Grand Marnier, and her grandfather's old rifles.\nThis incident makes up the first, grim chapter of the book. There is something about Desai's description that touches on humour, and yet it is much too painful to be funny. Even the judge's dog is wrong-footed in the encounter: \"Mutt began to do what she always did when she met strangers: she turned a furiously wagging bottom to the intruders and looked around from behind, smiling, conveying both shyness and hope.\" The judge is so deeply humiliated by having to prepare tea for the intruders that Sai has to pretend not to see what has happened. \"Both Sai and the cook had averted their gaze from the judge and his humiliation ... it was an awful thing, the downing of a proud man. He might kill the witness.\"\nAfter setting the scene with a moment of such high drama, Desai shows how the lives of Gyan and Sai and her grandfather, along with their cook and his son, intertwine before and after this horrible turning point. She casts her net wide, and scenes in which the cook's son, Biju, tries to make a life in the US are paralleled by the judge's experience studying in England in the 1940s. In both situations, we see a young Indian man setting off full of idealism about the cultural and material opportunities of the west, only to find himself ground down by the reality of being a second-class citizen.\nSo we hear about the judge as a young man, alienated by the coldness of Cambridge society. \"Despite his attempts to hide, he merely emphasised something that unsettled others. For entire days nobody spoke to him at all ... elderly ladies ... moved over when he sat next to them in the bus, so he knew that whatever they had, they were secure in their conviction that it wasn't even remotely as bad as what he had.\" We hear about the young Biju, working in filthy restaurants for exploitative employers, drifting from job to job, and then \"Slipping out and back on the street. It was horrible what happened to Indians abroad and nobody knew but other Indians abroad. It was a dirty little rodent secret.\"\nThe only time this atmosphere of loss and displacement lifts is in the scenes where Sai begins to fall in love with Gyan. Here, Desai's prose becomes marvellously flexible, sometimes almost too jumpy and uncontrolled, but always pulsing with energy. \"Her ears she displayed like items taken from under the counter and put before a discerning customer in one of the town's curio shops, but when he tried to test the depth of her eyes with his, her glance proved too slippery to hold; he picked it up and dropped it, retrieved it, dropped it again until it slid away and hid.\" Sadly, their love dies when Gyan joins the insurgents and stops coming to see Sai. Sai eventually goes to confront him, but the encounter ends in disappointment. Gyan thinks to himself as she leaves: \"Sai was not miraculous; she was an uninspiring person, a reflection of all the contradictions around her.\"\nIf we were in the world of Salman Rushdie, then Gyan and Sai would achieve a sensual communion that would stand against all the misunderstandings of ethnic and political and class hatreds. But the point of this novel, constantly brought home to us in small and big ways, is how individuals are always failing to communicate. Desai flicks from a failed telephone call to a failed marriage, a lost dog to lost parents, and the cumulative experience is of atomisation and thwarted yearning. I think this constant sense of disappointment is the reason why, although I admired this novel, I can't say I loved it. It's not surprising that Desai's characters occasionally refer to VS Naipaul, who has something of the same chastened view about the possibility of emotional fulfilment.\nThe only emotional connection that endures is that between the cook and his son, and even this is so uncertain, despite a momentarily hopeful ending, that it hardly lightens the book. Otherwise, we are left with Sai, and her sense, which is also the sensation experienced by the reader, of being battered by overlapping stories that drown out her own desire for the reassurance of love: \"Never again could she think there was but one narrative and that this narrative belonged only to herself, that she might create her own tiny happiness and live safely within it.\"\n· Natasha Walter's The New Feminism is published by Virago."

    "raw_text": "Mona Awad was trying on a forest-green, deer-patterned dress when she realised that the psychotically twee characters from her 2019 novel, Bunny, had burrowed back into her psyche.\n“I looked in the mirror and thought: This isn’t a dress for me, this is a dress for Cupcake,” she says, referencing one of the antagonists from her breakout book. “I started thinking about her, and the other bunnies,” says the Canadian author, “and I was like: I have to go back.”\nFor the uninitiated, Bunny is a surreal, hallucinogenic novel set on a prestigious creative writing master of fine arts (MFA) programme. Narrated by Samantha, an acerbic writer of dark fiction, it centres on a clique of saccharine students whose corny obsessions – internet hair-braiding tutorials, vintage typewriters, tiny baked goods – belie their true demonic natures. Behind the scenes, the bunnies are magically creating hunky man-bunny hybrids they call “drafts”. These darlings eventually have to be killed – literally, with axes.\nA satire about creativity and class, Bunny was chosen as a best book of the year by Time and Vogue, and hailed as “genius” by Margaret Atwood (Atwood later named Awad her “literary heir apparent” in a magazine feature). It became a bestseller in 2021, selling more than a million copies worldwide, after being embraced by fans of weird girl lit and so-called femgore on Booktok; in 2023 it was optioned for film by Bad Robot.\nAwad has published two subsequent novels: 2021’s All’s Well, a trippy tale about a theatre professor who finds an unconventional cure for chronic pain, and 2023’s Rouge, about a grieving woman who is drawn into a skincare cult. All the while, the buzz around Bunny has never faded. Its most ardent fans frequently send Awad tributes via Instagram DMs. A band, the Greys, wrote a Bunny-inspired song; one reader was inked with the line ‘Unsmiling, but soul happy’, and Awad mentions “an incredible tattoo of a decapitated bunny that I love”. The reaction, she says, has been “unreal. I’m so moved by it.”\nThis month Awad, 47, goes back down the rabbit hole with We Love You, Bunny, a follow-up novel voiced by the bunnies themselves, and one of their hybrid creations, Aerius. Expanding the Bunnyverse was a risk. “I knew that readers who did connect with Bunny had a very strong relationship with the text that had nothing to do with me,” Awad says. “I was afraid of meddling with that.” At the same time, it felt “inevitable” that she would return one day, in part because writing the book was such a transformative experience. It was her first foray into surrealism and fantasy; her 2016 debut, 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl, was realist. Bunny was “where I first discovered a way of telling stories that was exciting to me”.\nAwad is in San Diego, California, when we speak over Zoom. She looks like a glamorous goth in a black dress, her hair a dark curtain occasionally falling over one eye. This is not her own house but a place she found a few years ago when searching for a writing retreat: she spends the rest of the year between upstate New York, where she is an assistant professor on the creative writing programme at Syracuse University, and Boston, where her partner lives. But having had a “particularly vivid and exciting” experience writing Rouge at the house in La Jolla, she keeps coming back. “I think I became superstitious.”\nThe mystery of the creative process is a subject Awad mines with gleeful irreverence in We Love You, Bunny. She was interested in exploring “the ethics around creation”, she says, particularly when writing from Aerius’s perspective, in chapters that make playful reference to Frankenstein, Jane Eyre and the Velveteen Rabbit. “The bunnies are writers – and they’re psychotic,” she says. “They’re grabby, they’re greedy. There is something about making art that’s beautiful, but it’s also a bit of a violence. I was interested in capturing that hunger that we have to make. What’s that about? And what’s the cost of that?” Aerius is “disgusted by writers and all of their typing and scribbling and trying to take down the moon. Sometimes, I feel that way too!” she says, laughing.\nAwad was born in Montreal. She describes herself as “a very shy kid” who frequently felt like an outsider. For example, her mother, who was French Canadian and Catholic, raised her to speak English, which left her feeling “estranged” from the language spoken by the maternal half of her family, even though it was her mother tongue. “And the same thing happened with religion,” she says. Her father is Egyptian and Muslim; her parents decided that she would not take on either of their religions, which left her feeling marginalised at her strict Catholic school. Also, being half Egyptian, growing up in Montreal “I always felt not quite welcome, not quite at home. It was never direct. It was just kind of a feeling,” she says. Later, she struggled to adjust when she moved from Quebec to English-speaking Ontario. School was sometimes tough. “I dropped out a few times, and I even dropped out of college once,” she says, but she always loved to read. She was an only child whose parents worked in hotels. “My mother and father both always had to work Christmas and New Year’s. So usually, they would get access to a room, and that’s where I would be, reading.”\nAt college, Awad wrote a poem about body image in a creative writing class. Though her professor praised it effusively, she ended up dropping out. “I got so scared of failing that I just kind of stopped trying for quite a while, didn’t come back to [writing] seriously until my late 20s or early 30s.” Instead, she worked as a magazine editorial assistant in Montreal; wrote a spoof food column as Veronica Tartley, a writer with “a number of eating disorders, whose reviews are all filtered through her neuroses”; and studied a lot, including completing a masters in English at the University of Edinburgh, where she wrote her thesis on fairytales. It was during her MFA at Brown University – which inspired the similarly cloistered environment of Warren University in Bunny – then during a PhD at Denver, that she finally found a way to turn that early poem into a novel.\nAwad’s influences include Oscar Wilde, Jean Rhys and Atwood, particularly her “early, stranger gothic novels” – Lady Oracle, The Edible Woman, Surfacing, The Robber Bride – which she loved as a teenager. Her favourite aspect of Atwood’s work, she says, is its “wryness. There is always a sense of humour about it. No matter how deep she goes.” Awad describes herself as “a very dark-minded soul, and humour is definitely a way to survive”. Atwood’s endorsement has, of course, been major: the pair co-hosted a Zoom event for the release of Bunny in paperback and met in person at a photoshoot in 2023 at which the novelist advised Awad “to say ‘fuck it’ more, which I think is good advice for everyone”.\nIt feels relevant to the preoccupations of We Love You, Bunny that Awad and author Paul Tremblay are currently jointly suing Open AI for “ingesting” their books, though Awad says she cannot talk about the case. She will say that she worries about AI “all the time”; that she cares passionately about the “very human endeavour” of getting a voice down on the page. She is in the midst of creating another such voice as we speak. “I am working on a novel, and it is a monster,” she says – a term which one hopes and imagines, in Awad’s world, carries a twisted double meaning."

    "raw_text": "Women are writing absolutely horrific novels. Women are writing novels about people (usually women, usually young) who stalk, slash, bludgeon, infect, slice, dismember and cannibalise. Recent additions to the literary subgenre some have termed “femgore” – ultraviolent body-horror by female writers – include EK Sathue’s Youthjuice and The Eyes Are the Best Part by Monika Kim. In the autumn, Of the Flesh will be published, a new anthology of “modern horror stories” from authors including Evie Wyld, Lionel Shriver and Susan Barker.\nThe boom in mainstream body-horror novels written by and explicitly marketed to women could probably be loosely dated to the beginning of the decade, and the publication of Mona Awad’s splenetic campus satire, Bunny. Eliza Clark’s Boy Parts, promoted by critics as “American Psycho for girls” with patronising regularity, followed not long after. Both novels achieved huge commercial success and were early case studies in the power of BookTok to drive sales.\nThe most dependable augury of the birth of a new publishing micro-trend is the visual vocabulary of book covers, and four years post-Bunny, the “femgore cover” has at last hypostatised: neon pinks, glistening eyeballs, ambiguously truncated body parts in grayscale and flowers unfurling into hunks of raw meat. With its break into the mainstream, we may have reached the tipping point where body-horror begins – oh, so aptly – to eat itself, becoming, in the formulation of literary critic Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, “kinda subversive, kinda hegemonic”. Already, we’re seeing the beginnings of something like a critical pushback. In a piece for Lit Hub last year, Molly Odintz identified this new wave of literary “Patricia Batemans”, asking: “Are they battling the patriarchy, or are they symptoms of it? Is a serial killer a rebel, or the new pick-me girl?” Just last month, Dazed Digital’s Natalie Wall noted “the sickly rise of twee misandry” in novels, where any postfeminist nous “is obscured by shallow aesthetics”.\nBut was femgore subversive to begin with? It is certainly feels like a reaction to one aspect of the pop-cultural milieu of the 2000s, in which its overwhelmingly millennial cohort of authors (and I) came of age: the ubiquity of the “torture porn” franchise. Hyperviolent horror films, such as Hostel, Captivity and House of Wax, hybridised the more satirical splatter and slasher flicks of the 90s into something more earnestly sinister. These films often reserve the most extravagant brutalities and graphic mutilation for female victims – the more pneumatically hot, the better. Elisha Cuthbert was dining out for a decade on being annihilated by psychopaths. Almost all femgore novels reference the aesthetics motifs of blockbuster horror more or less knowingly, and might superficially appear to function as a straightforward cultural corrective to torture porn’s misogynistic excess: here, the beautiful young woman is no longer inflicted upon, but inflicting, and with all the zest of her male antecedents.\nThe backlash against torture-porn movies, and the provocative media campaigns often used to promote them, was pronounced, even at the time. But their enormous popularity was undeniable among a generation desensitised by some queasy mixture of – to pluck three horrible things at random out of the decade’s throbbing cultural stew – Jackass, the Abu Ghraib photographs and Robbie Williams tearing his skin off in the post-watershed version of the Rock DJ video. The lack of equivalence between these almost historical artefacts is pertinent: exposure to graphic images of the very real atrocities carried out during globalised, mechanised wars alongside images of artificial violence has become one of the defining dissonances of life as a digital native. One of the most interesting horror writers working now is Alison Rumfitt, whose truly transgressive second novel, Brainwyrms, explores online radicalisation and political conspiracy through the metaphor of parasitism in prose that lurches from depravity to depravity with the frenetically numbing pace of scrolling an X feed or flicking between 24-hour news channels. Meanwhile, EK Sathue’s Youthjuice and Mona Awad’s Rouge send up the cultish consumerism of the beauty industry, now augmented by social media, with a sort of Grand Guignol absurdity.\nFor horror fans, the genre often promises a kind of catharsis – a simulated terror from which the viewer, or reader, will ultimately emerge unscathed. Most women move through the world with a conditioned hyperawareness of their vulnerability to all kinds of violence, and this gives horror media a complicated appeal. As the novelist and academic Susannah Dickey – whose debut poetry collection, ISDAL, interrogates the popularity of the true-crime media – puts it: “a false sense of agency over one’s mind and body, especially when it comes to the negative affects that arise from often feeling bodily unsafe, is a comforting one.” Sexual violence, threatened or actualised, is present in nearly all femgore novels, and often serves as a catalyst for the protagonist’s vengeful brutality. Because of this, the novels’ popularity is often linked to the #MeToo movement, and heightened cultural awareness of the pervasiveness of violence against women and girls. But to read the femgore novel as a sort of narrative panacea to the traumas of real-world sexual violence is to ignore the complex and equivocal view they can offer of the networks of power in which violence takes place, and their meta-literary commentary on the aesthetic traditions of horror.\nSpeaking to the Guardian in 2021 about her arthouse slasher film Titane, French director Julia Ducournau spoke of “female horror”. For Ducournau, “there is a violence that is very specific to female film-makers, as far as horror is concerned – a violence that is inside, not a violence you have to fight, a violence you have to handle within yourself.” I think this observation is pertinent to female horror novelists as well, and cuts to something important about what femgore might do for its readers. The terror (and therefore pleasure) of the genre is not in the catharsis that comes from experiencing violence-without-violence, but in a sort of complicity: nihilistic identification with the force of violence itself. Can a girl ever hope to be safe from threat, when the world’s cruelty is embedded in her organs like microplastics? Elisha Cuthbert escapes, stumbling, bruised and battered, but whole, into the sunshine, while the femgore heroine stays locked in the basement with blood-spattered walls for life."

    "raw_text": "Two authors have filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, the company behind the artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT, claiming that the organisation breached copyright law by “training” its model on novels without the permission of authors.\nMona Awad, whose books include Bunny and 13 Ways of Looking at a Fat Girl, and Paul Tremblay, author of The Cabin at the End of the World, filed the class action complaint to a San Francisco federal court last week.\nChatGPT allows users to ask questions and type commands into a chatbot and responds with text that resembles human language patterns. The model underlying ChatGPT is trained with data that is publicly available on the internet.\nYet, Awad and Tremblay believe their books, which are copyrighted, were unlawfully “ingested” and “used to train” ChatGPT because the chatbot generated “very accurate summaries” of the novels, according to the complaint. Sample summaries are included in the lawsuit as exhibits.\nThis is the first lawsuit against ChatGPT that concerns copyright, according to Andres Guadamuz, a reader in intellectual property law at the University of Sussex. The lawsuit will explore the uncertain “borders of the legality” of actions within the generative AI space, he adds.\nBooks are ideal for training large language models because they tend to contain “high-quality, well-edited, long-form prose,” said the authors’ lawyers, Joseph Saveri and Matthew Butterick, in an email to the Guardian. “It’s the gold standard of idea storage for our species.”\nThe complaint said that OpenAI “unfairly” profits from “stolen writing and ideas” and calls for monetary damages on behalf of all US-based authors whose works were allegedly used to train ChatGPT. Though authors with copyrighted works have “great legal protection”, said Saveri and Butterick, they are confronting companies “like OpenAI who behave as if these laws don’t apply to them”.\nHowever, it may be difficult to prove that authors have suffered financial losses specifically because of ChatGPT being trained on copyrighted material, even if the latter turned out to be true. ChatGPT may work “exactly the same” if it had not ingested the books, said Guadamuz, because it is trained on a wealth of internet information that includes, for example, internet users discussing the books.\nOpenAI has become “increasingly secretive” about its training data, said Saveri and Butterick. In papers released alongside early iterations of ChatGPT, OpenAI gave some clues as to the size of the “internet-based books corpora” it used as training material, which it called only “Books2”. The lawyers deduce that the size of this dataset – estimated to contain 294,000 titles – means the books could only be drawn from shadow libraries such as Library Genesis (LibGen) and Z-Library, through which books can be secured in bulk via torrent systems.\nThis case will “likely rest on whether courts view the use of copyright material in this way as ‘fair use’”, said Lilian Edwards, professor of law, innovation and society at Newcastle University, “or as simple unauthorised copying.” Edwards and Guadamuz both emphasise that a similar lawsuit brought in the UK would not be decided in the same way, because the UK does not have the same “fair use” defence.\nThe UK government has been “keen on promoting an exception to copyright that would allow free use of copyright material for text and data mining, even for commercial purposes,” said Edwards, but the reform was “spiked” after authors, publishers and the music industry were “appalled”.\nSince ChatGPT was launched in November 2022, the publishing industry has been in discussion over how to protect authors from the potential harms of AI technology. Last month, The Society of Authors (SoA) published a list of “practical steps for members” to “safeguard” themselves and their work. Yesterday, the SoA’s chief executive, Nicola Solomon told the trade magazine the Bookseller that the organisation was “very pleased” to see authors suing OpenAI, having “long been concerned” about the “wholesale copying” of authors’ work to train large language models.\nRichard Combes, head of rights and licensing at the Authors’ Licensing and Collecting Society (ALCS), said that current regulation around AI is “fragmented, inconsistent across different jurisdictions and struggling to keep pace with technological developments”. He encouraged policymakers to consult principles that the ALCS has drawn up which “protect the true value that human authorship brings to our lives and, notably in the case of the UK, our economy and international identity”.\nSaveri and Butterick believe that AI will eventually resemble “what happened with digital music and TV and movies” and comply with copyright law. “They will be based on licensed data, with the sources disclosed.”\nThe lawyers also noted it is “ironic” that “so-called ‘artificial intelligence’” tools rely on data made by humans. “Their systems depend entirely on human creativity. If they bankrupt human creators, they will soon bankrupt themselves.”\nOpenAI were approached for comment."

    "raw_text": "Next year marks a decade since Britain voted to leave the EU. A whole 10 years of turmoil, and still the country can’t seem to agree exactly why it happened or what should happen next, with both leavers and remainers increasingly united in frustration about what the referendum has delivered. How did we end up here?\nIn Between the Waves, New Statesman editor Tom McTague makes an ambitious attempt to answer that question by zooming out and putting Brexit in its broader historical context. The result is a great big entertaining sweep of a book, tracing the roots of Britain’s ambiguous relationship with its neighbours back to the end of the second world war, and will be joyfully inhaled by any reader who loves the kind of podcasts that invariably feature two men talking to each other. It charts the path from a time when membership was seen as an antidote to British decline – the chance for “a nation that lost an empire to gain a continent”, as the Sun put it in 1975 – to a time when it was singled out as the cause of it.\nSomewhat more controversially, it reframes the referendum less as an angry backlash from the economically left-behind, and more as the intellectually coherent outcome of a relationship that was always fundamentally unstable.\nFrom the beginning, McTague makes clear, Britain’s choice was between joining a union whose purpose (of pooling sovereignty, initially to contain a German resurgence) we distrusted, or staying out of something potentially powerful enough to threaten our national interests in the long run. Whatever else has changed – and bear in mind that in the 1970s Labour was the Eurosceptic party, while Ted Heath’s Conservative government led the pro-European charge – the constant has been British reluctance to be either wholly in or wholly out. Successive governments, he argues, managed those tensions by conveniently ignoring the EU’s core mission of ever closer integration in hot pursuit of all its other benefits.\nSeen through this prism, David Cameron’s decision to call his career-ending referendum becomes less a panicky response to the rise of Nigel Farage and more a willingness to face up to contradictions others had brushed under the carpet, and which an expanding Europe had more clearly exposed.\nHistory is famously told by the winners, and McTague’s lead witnesses lean towards the leave side. With its focus on tracing Brexit’s origin story, the book feels oddly thin on insight from the Blair-Brown governments, an eventful period for EU membership when the battle was essentially between pro-Europeans over exactly how deep to go. Instead we get an exhaustive account of the academic influences on Michael Gove’s and Dominic Cummings’s thinking, and of the formation of the Eurosceptic campaign group Business for Sterling.\nEuropean perspectives are also largely absent from a narrative that is hooked around a series of big British characters, from Enoch Powell to Margaret Thatcher to Cummings and Farage. The rest of the continent is relegated to a kind of vague background presence in Britain’s internal dramas. We’ve all been in relationships like that, I suppose, but it would have been nice to hear a little more from across the Channel – perhaps about why other member states such as Ireland and Denmark, who struggled to gain public consent for further integration, nonetheless stuck with it, or whether the great rupture of 2016 was avoidable. (McTague considers the Faragist argument that had the Blair government-imposed transitional curbs on immigration from eastern European members, eurosceptic feeling might never have grown so strong, before concluding that it lacks nuance.)\nThe book ends, however, by acknowledging that Britain’s relationship with Europe may not be as settled as it currently looks, a prudent hedging of bets now that the threat from Putin is once more drawing British interests closer to those of its neighbours. But it’s also a reminder of the book’s underlying theme: that the British idea of Europe has never really been fixed, and changes conveniently to suit us. Though this chapter of our joint histories may be concluded, the story goes on."

And The Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown is back after eight years’ absence with the thumpingly titled The Secret of Secrets (Bantam, 9 September), another race-against-time conspiracy fest for his Harvard symbologist hero Robert Langdon.\nOctober promises a James Bond spin-off in Vaseem Khan’s Quantum of Menace (Zaffre, 23 October), the first in a cosy mystery series featuring Q, now ousted from MI6 and running his own investigation into the death of a quantum computer scientist.

Expect more dark secrets and simmering community tensions against a new ruggedly beautiful landscape.\nMemoir\nFrom Hollywood to Harvey Nicks… more life stories\nIf the end of the year is a time for looking back at life, that’s not been lost on celebrities (I’m sure it has nothing to do with Christmas sales). Musicians are to the fore. Scooby Snacks singer Huey Morgan tells tales of 90s excess in The Fun Lovin’ Criminal (Quercus, 11 September). For a grungier vibe try Rumours of My Demise (Faber, 6 November) by Evan Dando of indie darlings the Lemonheads. Slightly eclipsing them both in star power – sorry, guys – is Lionel Richie, whose autobiography Truly (William Collins, 30 September) is a sure-fire bestseller, given the man has shifted more than 125m albums globally. Yusuf/Cat Stevens tells us about his wild world in Cat on the Road to Findout (Constable, 18 September), and from the clubs, drag DJ Jodie Harsh dishes the dirt on London’s 00s scene in You Had to Be There (Faber, 25 September).\nFrom Hollywood comes Charlie Sheen’s tell‑all The Book of Sheen (Gallery, 9 September), a tome he “shouldn’t be alive” to write after what are euphemistically described as a “vortex of extracurricular activities”. And Michael J Fox offers not a full-blown memoir but a slice of acting life in Future Boy (Headline, 14 October), the story of his 80s smash hits Family Ties and Back to the Future. Rocky Horror Show star Tim Curry looks back on a wayward career in Vagabond (Century, 14 October).\nIt’s not just actors: “queen of shops” Mary Portas tells us how she got her break at Harvey Nicks in I Shop, Therefore I Am (Canongate, 2 October) while comedian and writer Ben Elton asks What Have I Done? (Pan Macmillan, 9 October), a question that may also be relevant to tennis star Boris Becker, whose Inside (HarperCollins, 25 September) tells us how he went from Wimbledon to Wandsworth prison. Malala Yousafzai returns with the story of life after becoming a human rights icon, Finding My Way (W&N, 21 October), and The Orchid Thief author Susan Orlean, promises to enchant with Joyride (Atlantic, 6 November), her memoir of chasing down stories for the New Yorker."

    "raw_text": "In 2018, the American writer Patricia Lockwood published an essay entitled “How Do We Write Now?”. The piece was an attempt to reckon with the damage done to a creative mind by years of excessive exposure to the internet. Of her efforts to reclaim some mental space from the endless swirling absurdity of online life, she wrote: “If I look at a phone first thing the phone becomes my brain for the day […] If I open up Twitter and the first thing I see is the president’s weird bunched ass above a sand dune as he swings a golf club I am doomed. The ass will take up residence in my mind. It will install a gold toilet there.”\nLockwood’s debut novel, No One Is Talking About This, is in some ways a more substantial attempt to answer the question posed by the essay. Its nameless protagonist is, recognisably, a sparsely fictionalised embodiment of the same voice, with the same basic problems. Like Lockwood, she is a writer who came to be celebrated for her good tweets; she is invited to cities all over the world to speak about “the new communication, the new slipstream of information”. When we meet her, the tweet in question, “Can a dog be twins?”, has “recently reached the stage of penetration where teenagers posted the cry-face emoji at her”. (Though she initially came to prominence on Twitter, Lockwood’s renown is a lot more deserved than her fictional avatar’s: in 2013, her extraordinarily powerful poem “The Rape Joke” went viral, and in 2017 she published an acclaimed comic memoir, Priestdaddy.)\nThe protagonist is living with the effects of irony poisoning. Her mind is a sprawling memory palace of ass, in each of whose chambers has been installed a gold toilet. The internet, which she coyly refers to as “the portal”, is, for her, life itself: a place where she is perpetually suspended between amusement and horror. In the opening pages, we find her absolutely losing it at a video of people being flung from a malfunctioning carnival ride. (“‘Ahahaha!’ she yelled, the new and funnier way to laugh.”)\nLockwood’s observations of the affective reality of the portal, the skittering triviality of its denizens, is both ardent and appalled. Her evocations of this collective consciousness often achieve a nice balance of poetic intensity and analytical force. “Every day their attention must turn,” she writes, “like the shine on a school of fish, all at once, toward a new person to hate. Sometimes the subject was a war criminal, but other times it was someone who made a heinous substitution in guacamole. It was not so much the hatred she was interested in as the swift attenuation, as if their collective blood had made a decision.”\nThe novel is neatly divided into two parts, each made up of tightly composed fragments. The first half is a study of a peculiarly static existence, a life spent gazing into the roiling abyss of the portal. We are in the company, here, of a person with full-blown brain worms – Twitter’s preferred term for the morally and cognitively degenerative condition caused by spending too much time posting, and reading the posts of others (most of whom themselves have brain worms).\nAfter an event in Toronto, she meets a man she knows from the internet, a Weird Twitter personage who has himself acquired a certain standing for posting photos of his balls online. Their conversation turns to the question of how this “new shared sense of humour” which “had spread like a regional fire across the globe” might be written about, and she remarks that everyone who has tried has been getting it all wrong. He agrees, “exhaling gently through his nostrils to be funny, in a tone that meant she was getting it wrong too”.\nIf Lockwood is invested in anything here, she is invested in not getting it wrong – in accurately representing a consciousness marinated in the shallow irony (and terrible levity) of the portal. The fragmentary form, with its pointillist narrative technique, will be familiar enough to readers of lately canonised 1970s novels such as Elizabeth Hardwick’s Sleepless Nights and Renata Adler’s Speedboat, and the more recent work of Jenny Offill. In Lockwood’s hands, the approach is intended to be commensurate to the dimensions of Twitter itself – its punchiness imperative, its hunger for the absurd and the awful. “Why were we all writing like this now?” Because, she suggests, “it was the way the portal wrote”. The form, in other words, is an attempt to both reflect and transcend the reshaping of the protagonist’s mind. These fragments she has shored against her brain worms.\nLockwood is an incontrovertibly gifted writer. Her sentences are routinely surprising, her voice a startling agglomeration of poetic clarity and hectic comedy. But weirdly enough, given the comic gifts on display in Priestdaddy, it’s that hectic quality that causes problems. It wouldn’t be quite fair to call No One Is Talking About This a comic novel, but it does seem, particularly in its first half, too fixated on getting jokes over the line, and too pleased with itself for having done so. There is an airlessness that reminded me of being in the presence of a Known Wit, intent on living up to their reputation by keeping the jests coming at all costs. Before being interviewed at the BBC, for instance, the protagonist asks her interviewer whether he would consider himself English, and his conflicted reaction provokes a characteristic riff: “Had she committed a Brexit? It was so easy, these days, to accidentally commit a Brexit.” At such moments, the fragmentary lyricism is overpowered by an anxiously comedic super-ego, as though the Family Guy writers room had done a script punch-up on Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet. The book also has a related problem: far too much of it, to put it bluntly, amounts to lyrical descriptions of memes.\nMy own impatience with this perhaps stems less from alienation, as it might for readers less familiar with Twitter, than from overfamiliarity. I am myself, at this stage of the game, more brain worm than man; if this book has an ideal reader, it might as well be me. As the novel progressed, it struck me that its problem was paradoxical in form: it seemed incapable of being serious, and it was precisely that unseriousness that prevented it from being properly funny. About halfway through, the protagonist’s sister becomes pregnant, and the child is born with very severe birth defects. And yet she remains committed, helplessly, to the new sense of humour. “Call me old fashioned,” she argues to herself in the shower, “but I happen to believe that a BABY! should get to have an ASS! no matter WHAT!”\nBut as the dimensions of this human tragedy become clearer, things get more complex, and more sophisticated: the novel itself becomes seriously concerned with the problem of unseriousness – which is, you could argue, among the more serious problems of our time. The language of the portal is, suddenly, inadequate to the intimate sadness of the protagonist’s new reality. “If all she was was funny,” she asks, “and none of this was funny, where did that leave her?” That central question hovers incessantly over much of the book, but not in the way that seems intended. Maybe it’s my own brain worms, my own irony poisoning, but if you’re laughing with her as rarely as I was, that premise feels flawed.\nEventually, the anxious comedy gives way to a richer and more complex amalgamation of grief and beauty. Although Lockwood’s protagonist never fully transcends her ironic self-enclosure, and therefore only fleetingly allows us a clear view of the baby’s parents – the people to whom this awful thing is actually happening – there are nonetheless moments of real poignancy, as she describes her niece’s little life, and the heartbreak of her condition. Here, at last, profound connections are made: between a thwarted consciousness and the world, between Lockwood’s talent and her subject, and between the novel and its readers – this one, at any rate.\nThere’s a moment near the end of the book when the protagonists’s brother, himself a victim of severe irony poisoning, introduces himself to a stranger as “the baby’s husband”. It’s not a portal reference, or a glib intentional absurdity; it’s a bizarre error borne of confusion and grief. “Their laughter approached hysteria,” the protagonist tells us, “tears streaked down their faces, they gripped each other’s arms and could not stop.” This moment, coming after pages of wrenching sadness, feels real, and raw, and authentically absurd. I was with these people, in their pain and hilarity. I was, for the first time, and in the old and funniest way, laughing out loud. Ahahaha."

    "raw_text": "This year’s Booker judges had a crowded field to pick from, with scores of eligible books from previously nominated writers and five new novels from winners alone (John Banville, Kiran Desai, Alan Hollinghurst, Ian McEwan and Ben Okri). Of these, Hollinghurst is one eyebrow-raising exclusion, for his elegiac and beautifully composed panorama of gay life in Britain over the past seven decades, Our Evenings. But it’s no surprise that the list is headed by Desai’s epic The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny, a novel in the works since her Booker win two decades ago and due out this September.\nClocking in at nearly 700 pages, this is a love story about two people pulled between India and the US, family inheritance and personal ambition, intimacy and solitude. Immersive and gently funny, her vast canvas painted with an exquisitely fine brush, it looks like a leading contender on a canon-building list – nine of the authors are making their first Booker appearance. There is an emphasis on family stories; sometimes intimate and direct, as in Claire Adam’s account of a woman forced to give up her baby as a teenager, Love Forms, or Ben Markovits’s rueful study of a father contemplating life once the kids have left home, The Rest of Our Lives, but more often as a lens through which to examine the forces of history.\nDesai’s novel is an intricate portrait of an interconnected world, while Tash Aw’s The South, the first in a proposed quartet, looks at two farming families in 1990s Malaysia against a backdrop of tumultuous change and ominous signs of climate crisis. Susan Choi’s previous novel, 2019’s Trust Exercise, was a standout in American fiction; Flashlight is straighter and less playful, but scales up her ambition and breaks new ground in its examination of one family with roots in Korea, Japan and the US, illuminating the seismic effects of political upheaval on individual lives.\nThe two debut novelists on the list respond to the forces of history with formal invention. Canadian-Ukrainian author Maria Reva begins Endling as a comic caper through Ukraine’s marriage industry, from the perspective of a cash-strapped scientist with a passion for endangered snails; Russia’s full-scale invasion blows the book wide open, calling into question the role of the writer and the purpose of fiction – and offering answers that are full of energy. Albanian-American author Ledia Xhoga toys subtly with realism. Misinterpretation, her portrait of an Albanian interpreter in New York, caught between two cultures and struggling with compassion fatigue and her own traumas as she tries to help others, is full of misunderstandings and missed connections that echo the faults and gaps of translation.\nTwo slim, slippery books revel in formal disruption. Katie Kitamura’s enigmatic Audition, focusing on an American actor and a man young enough to be her son, offers contradictory narratives in order to explore identity, performance, and what we are to one another: this is a book to ponder and argue over. In Universality, Natasha Brown is also interested in the power dynamics of storytelling: she constructs a merciless satire of the current media landscape, with its meretricious culture wars, through the jigsaw-puzzle chronicle of a long read that goes viral.\nThe four remaining books are all by men, an answer perhaps to claims that male writing in the UK is in crisis, and they all do fascinating things with interiority. Jonathan Buckley writes spare, slightly Cuskian philosophical novels; in his 13th, One Boat, a woman’s sorties to Greece to work through her bereavements lead into reflections on ethics, memory and the processes of thought. In Benjamin Wood’s quiet but immensely atmospheric Seascraper, a young man plies his grandfather’s trade of “shanking”, scraping the seashore for shrimp in an England that is moving on without him. Muted but precise prose burrows into his hopes and dreams for a tale that resonates far beyond the telling.\nAndrew Miller’s The Land in Winter is also situated in a postwar England on the brink of change, here the “Big Freeze” of 1962-3, and travels deep into the hearts of its characters, two young married couples in the West Country. This novel has had my heart since it was published last November, and I’m delighted to see it on the list: I think it’s the best book yet from a stellar writer who’s been publishing for three decades. (By contrast, this year’s Booker blow for me is the exclusion of Sarah Hall; I’ve been telling everyone that her magisterial, millennia-spanning Helm, out at the end of August, was a likely winner.)\nThe final title, also a favourite of mine this year, creates powerful effects through an unusual tactic: utterly refusing interiority. Flesh by David Szalay is a very modern everyman story, with his central character at the mercy of forces beyond his control, a rise and fall playing out across a depressed childhood in Hungary, life in the army and an upwardly mobile stint in on-the-make London. By keeping his antihero a mystery to the reader, Szalay opens up the biggest questions about what we can and cannot know. It feels like something that hasn’t been done before in quite this way – and that only fiction could do.\n-\nTo explore all the books on the longlist for the Booker prize 2025 visit guardianbookshop.com.

    "raw_text": "With a title like that, you expect a belter of an opening, and Oyinkan Braithwaite’s debut novel doesn’t disappoint. It kicks off with Korede, sponge in hand, reflecting that the hardest place to scrub clean of blood is the join between the shower and the caulking. She should know; this is the third boyfriend her sister Ayoola has dispatched in “self-defence”.\nThis is no crime thriller, however. Braithwaite is most interested in the relationship between the sisters, who are close despite their opposing natures (Ayoola is gorgeous and slapdash, Korede angular and efficient). She puts their bond under increasing strain to find the breaking point. Korede feels obliged to help cover up for her sister’s misdeeds, but how will she react when Ayoola makes a play for the cute doctor she has long adored from afar?\nIt’s a classic love triangle, with the added twist of the knife Ayoola takes with her on dates. Initially, though, Braithwaite pulls her punches on the serial-killer storyline: Korede spends more time being scared that Ayoola will steal her crush than that she’ll stab him. Once the tears start to flow, it all gets a bit schmaltzy. “Seeing them together turns me inside out,” Korede laments. In a different sense, it may well turn the doctor inside out, too.\nBraithwaite lives in Lagos, and she makes full use of the city’s character – the traffic jams, the cops, the rain that breaks umbrellas – to give the story a remarkably strong sense of place. Nigerian culture is alluded to subtly, as with the sister father’s wooden cane: its intricate carvings capture the past, but its legacy of violence stretches out into the future.\nBy the final chapters, the book has so much going on that it becomes difficult to tell how the various storylines are intertwining. It all adds up to a distinctive but uneasy mix of morbid humour, love story, slashfest, family saga and grave meditation on how abusive behaviour is passed down through the generations. The real joy lies in the characters: Ayoola is a delight, waltzing through Lagos with supreme self-confidence: “Only the guilty go to jail,” she reassures herself, confident that she doesn’t fall into that category. Korede, too, is complex and intriguing. The pair of them outshine their story, which ultimately tries to do too much and so never quite delivers on the promise of its audacious conceit.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "I first read I Love Dick a few years ago. What was it? I didn’t know exactly: some kind of cult book I’d heard of via whispers from the US, where it was published in 1997. Reader, I read it, and I still wasn’t sure. An autobiography, a piece of fiction, a series of essays, a work of critical theory?\nIt tells the story of Chris, a 39-year-old “failed” video artist, married to Sylvère, a cultural critic more than a decade her senior. When the couple visit Sylvère’s friend, Dick, Chris conceives an unrequited passion for him, and her husband colludes with her to play it out in love letters, which Sylvère reads, and sometimes co-writes, and which they mostly do not send. The letters proliferate into autobiographical confessions, essays on artists, rants against the position of women in the art world.\nThe eponymous “Dick” is the British academic Dick Hebdige. Sylvère is real, too: Kraus’s ex-husband, with whom she still runs Semiotext(e), a publisher of cultural theory, avant-garde fiction and essays by authors who, like Kraus, work at the intersection of writing and art, including Kathy Acker and Gary Indiana.\nI thought the book would be a terrifying feminist classic with a cover I might not want to be seen with on the tube. But guess what: I Love Dick is funny, very funny. Kraus’s development of her narrator persona in her subsequent novel, Torpor, has been compared to I Love Lucy; that would be accurate had Lucy been a cerebral sometime-topless dancer and adept survivor in the New York art world. Here, Kraus introduces her “Lonely Girl Phenomenology”: “I believed I was inventing a new genre and it was secret because there was nobody to tell it to.” The book was published only a little past the heyday of critical theory, and Kraus was aware of how conceptualising and naming experience could validate it; she was also aware of the absurdity of this practice. In that spirit, I’m going to call ILD a screwball tragedy.\n“It works in practice,” as the old poststructuralist’s joke goes, “but will it work in theory?” In the book Sylvère and Chris have grown apart, but “maintain their intimacy via deconstruction”, what Sylvère calls “the desire to fictionalise life”. There is a certain brand of self-flagellating confessional lit that is, it has recently been said, specifically female. An S&M aficionado, Kraus knows all about abjection, and she knows about the line between play and when it’s for real. “The game is real, or even better than real,” Chris tells Dick in her first letter, framing the book as a high-wire act of self-exposure, balanced with consummate art. “Dear Dick … I guess in a sense I’ve killed you,” Chris writes later, as her letters go beyond her own desires to become a kind of art project.\nILD is a joyful riposte to all those stories in which clever women fall victim to the pressures of convention – from The Yellow Wallpaper to The Bell Jar and beyond – and also to the countless books by men in which women are crushed by romantic encounters: from Madame Bovary to Anna Karenina to Laclos’s epistolatory Les Liaisons Dangereuses and André Breton’s autofiction, Nadja. Equally earnest and flip, ILD balances its narrator’s yearning with the surprising empowerment the performance of her abjection brings. By giving the tragic heroine an absurd edge, Kraus is able to tackle some serious stuff. “I always believe that the rhetoric is part of a strategy,” as she told Lauren Elkin in an interview for the White Review.\nWhat makes now the right moment to publish Kraus’s debut novel for the first time in the UK, after 18 years? There is a hint of retrospective gratitude: without Kraus, we might not have had the philosophers in high heels of Zoe Pilger’s Eat My Heart Out, or Susana Medina’s Philosophical Toys. Without her challenge to what she called “the ‘serious’ contemporary hetero-male novel … a thinly veiled Story of Me”, Sheila Heti might never have asked How Should a Person Be?, and Ben Lerner might never have written Leaving the Atocha Station. A whole generation of writers owes her.\nDo you have to read critical theory to get ILD? It may help, but perhaps no more than knowing about palaeontology will help you enjoy Bringing up Baby. You can get high on the book’s passion, its humour, on the creation of a still-fresh style that not only says new things about female experience, but is able simultaneously to comment, tongue-in-cheek, on how this experience has been written, filmed and made into art. Kraus writes with an elegance that includes enough rough edges to make I Love Dick a game for real.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "If we accept for argument’s sake that Go Set a Watchman, Harper Lee’s premature sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, has been intentionally published by its author, we are left with only two significant questions, both about value: is it any good, and does it do any good? Mockingbird indisputably did quite a lot of good, and it’s very good at what it sets out to do. There’s a reason Mockingbird is so loved: it is charming, beautifully controlled and heart-warming. The answer to whether Watchman is any good aesthetically is simple: not very. The question of whether it may do any good morally is more complicated, and circles around the outrage so many readers report at discovering Atticus Finch, that beloved imaginary Abraham Lincoln of the civil rights movement, spouting racist bile.\nThe devotion that readers can feel to imaginary characters is a strange and wonderful thing, at the heart of the cognitive mystery that is the reading process. Because it’s internalised, reading closes the gap of detachment we feel watching others enact a story; characters we only imagine entwine with our own thoughts, histories and perceptions. This process is amplified when the story converges with readers’ own sense of personal development. If we have grown up admiring an idealised father figure like Atticus, incorporating him into our value system, then the sense of betrayal at finding him espousing immoral views may be real, and profound.\nThis is the dilemma faced not only by readers of Watchman, but by Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, who returns home during the civil rights movement to find the father she thought despised racism defending segregation. The slender plot of Watchman hangs on this disclosure. Scout must come to terms with the revelation that her father is not Saint Atticus, leaving Watchman’s readers to struggle with the same problem: we’re all Scout Finch now, shocked at discovering our father figure has feet of Alabama clay. Maybe it is time for us all to grow up.\nInitially, Watchman seems to offer a more adult perspective than Mockingbird’s tightly focused child’s eye, indicating that Jean Louise will finish losing her innocence, dragging several million readers unwillingly with her. Although the disclosures about Atticus are repellent, one hopes that adults can withstand an imaginary encounter with nastiness (as well as the imaginary death of another important character). Some readers welcome the prospect of an Atticus who turns out to be human after all, no matter how ugly the humanity on display. And then there are those who insisted all along that deeper scrutiny revealed a few warts even on the Atticus of Mockingbird. Perhaps Watchman will prompt a more complex debate about the role of racism in Mockingbird, where it is often more a plot function than a moral dilemma. Perhaps it might also prompt a more complex debate about what we hope for from fictional characters.\nSome have argued that objecting to how Atticus “really” turns out in Watchman misunderstands how fiction works. Atticus has no reality off the page, they point out, and it is true that Atticus hasn’t been skulking around for 50 years hoping no one would out him as a racist. But what is meant by this, presumably, is that there is more to Atticus as a fictional character than meets his daughter’s eye in Mockingbird. There he appears to be a proto-champion of civil rights, but in the (fictional) truth revealed in Watchman, he is “really” a racist. (The problem isn’t that such readers don’t understand the fictional enterprise, but that their critics seem not to understand that “really” can be used figuratively.) Discussions of what Atticus is “really” like converge with the fact that Mockingbird is semi-autobiographical: Maycomb is based on Monroeville, Alabama; Dill is modelled on Truman Capote; Lee’s father was an upright southern lawyer; and so on, all of which makes it facile to dismiss anxieties about Atticus’s reality as the folly of naive readers. A more complicated knotting of art and life lies at the heart of Mockingbird’s story, and of its appeal. Part of the novel’s claim to profundity has always related to the real history of civil rights in the American south, and the fact that this fable about racial justice in Alabama emerged in the wake of the Montgomery (Alabama) bus boycott. The widespread concern over what Atticus is “really” like surely stems in part from this awareness of the character’s entanglement in a very real history of violence and profound injustice, a toxic actuality that all too obviously lingers. The devotion people feel to Atticus is in direct proportion to his claim on goodness, to Lee’s implicit assurance that there were non-racist white people in a white-supremacist society prepared to defend truth and justice, and that these values might still be part of the American way. Readers’ subsequent sense of betrayal is equally proportional to the conviction that Atticus stood for a significant promise, now broken. If even Atticus Finch is a white supremacist, what then?\nTo Kill a Mockingbird is a consoling book, and a childish one. It knows that democracy, justice and courage are good, and that racism, incest and false allegations of rape are bad. Good white people are so good that good black people stand up when they pass out of respect, and this makes no one uncomfortable. Bad white people die or disappear from the story. There are no bad black people at all, because that would undermine Lee’s racial parable. None of this makes very grave moral demands on the reader. But there are many of us who’ve long had our doubts. Some are discomfited by the paternalism good white characters demonstrate toward black ones in Mockingbird, although others counter that this is historically realistic: paternalism was a common attitude in the Jim Crow south. True, but Mockingbird heartily endorses Atticus’s morality, and his values are rather more dubious than the book, or many of its readers, care to admit. Atticus overlooks the racism of characters such as Mrs Dubose, while praising the “courage” she shows in breaking her drug addiction. Lynch mobs are populated by decent folk who can be shamed out of violence by small children; the threats of torture and mutilation that went with lynching are dismissed as a “blind spot”. In Mockingbird, Atticus tells Scout that the Ku Klux Klan was “a political organisation more than anything” that briefly emerged “way back about nineteen-twenty” but “they couldn’t find anybody to scare”. We might wonder whether Calpurnia or Tom Robinson would have agreed.\nWatchman simply makes all of this more explicit. Atticus gives a long speech towards the novel’s end defending paternalistic racism, explaining that black people are too childish to be given power. This is moral casuistry of the worst kind from someone the novel continues to insist is an uncompromising upholder of the law. “Every man’s island, Jean Louise,” proudly states Watchman’s back cover, “every man’s watchman, is his conscience.” Atticus bends his conscience to protect his privilege, while Jean Louise, who earlier vomited on the discovery of her father’s racism, now accepts his argument, admitting that although she’s all for equality in theory, she wouldn’t want to marry a black person. After revealing Atticus’s segregationist views, Watchman passes the moral torch from Atticus to his brother, Jack, who is avowedly accommodationist, advising Scout to accept what she cannot change. Uncle Jack also argues, and Scout likewise accepts, that the Klan is perfectly harmless as long as it is merely a bunch of “fools” parading around in sheets. As soon as the Klan stooped to violence, Uncle Jack maintains, Atticus would use the full power of the law to try to stop it. But violence is not the only form intimidation takes, and black people had good reason for not regarding Klan parades as mere “foolishness”. Watchman finally compounds all this ardent paternalism by insinuating that Atticus’s racism, while objectionable, is also a fatherly gift he has given his daughter to help her separate from him.\nAnyone who wants to understand how cognitive dissonance works should read Watchman: the book is shot through with it. Thus Jean Louise insists that the racial violence of the 1950s was provoked by desegregation. Before the civil rights movement, the good white people of Maycomb were not racist, she is certain. Which leaves her wondering: “What turned ordinary men into screaming dirt at the top of their voices, what made her kind of people harden and say ‘nigger’ when the word had never crossed their lips before?” The answer, of course, is that white supremacism was always there, but could afford to appear covert when its authority was undisputed; only when its power was threatened did it need to reveal itself in all its malevolence. Nor is it a negligible detail that Jean Louise frames this question in terms of “her kind”. “There’s four kinds of folks in the world,” Jem explains in Mockingbird. “There’s the ordinary kind like us and the neighbours, there’s the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes.” “Our kind” are people with “background”, which is a euphemism for “breeding”.\nAtticus gently mocks his sister for insisting on the Finches’ “gentle breeding”, but both books uphold biological determinism. The poor white-trash Ewells in Mockingbird are irredeemable, because their kind are dirty, incestuous and drunken. The Ewells belong at the dump, and the Finches leave them there, including 19-year-old Mayella, who, the book implies, has been raped all her life by her father, before she takes a fancy to poor Tom Robinson, the impoverished black man whom she plots to seduce. Once Mayella has served her plot function, the book forgets all about her, sparing no further pity despite Atticus’s constant injunctions to cultivate empathy. In Watchman, the Robinson trial is just a passing anecdote, with more realistic details: the girl who accuses the black man of rape is 14, and Atticus’s defence is not that the man didn’t consent (as is the case in Mockingbird) but that the girl did. His defence was successful, in this version: the jury acquitted the black man, perhaps because in reality sexism sometimes trumps racism. There is no mention of incest in the trial: instead, another “white trash” daughter is made pregnant by her father in a different incident, confusing the young Scout about pregnancy. In neither case is there any suggestion that white-trash daughters might object to being raped by their fathers; these girls are nugatory, left to disappear back into their backwoods existence.\nAt issue, ultimately, is a eugenicist conception of identity that continually sabotages the fine moral ambitions of both books. Lee constantly falls back on the idea that people are just “born” a certain way; social environment and education have nothing to do with it. This logic leads Watchman to insist several times that Jean Louise was “born colour-blind”, another instance of pure cognitive dissonance, in which biological determinism is invoked in order to explain the mystery of why someone isn’t a racist. This implicitly exculpates everyone else of “her kind”, who can’t help that they were born racist any more than black people can help being born childish. And it means there was no hypocrisy, no treachery: Atticus did not betray his principles when his power was threatened, but is to be admired for upholding his (racist) ideals. This casuistry enables Jean Louise to make a separate peace with segregationists, while insisting that she rejects segregationism. Meanwhile, a romantic subplot with a childhood friend who supports Atticus’s segregationist schemes is resolved by sheer denial. Hank tells Jean Louise that his racism protects his more precarious social status as a white man without “breeding”, and that her lofty contempt for it is a luxury afforded by her class status. Jean Louise rejects this speech, as if Lee couldn’t consciously accept what she secretly knew to be true: that these categories are not hereditary, but the effects of centuries of inequality and injustice.\nThis is not an anachronistic demand that Lee be ahead of her time. In 1949, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote a song called “You’ve Got to Be Carefully Taught” for their hit show South Pacific, in which a soldier sings: “You’ve got to be taught to be afraid / Of people whose eyes are oddly made, / And people whose skin is a different shade, / You’ve got to be carefully taught.” (When the show toured the American south, demands were made that the song be cut; Rodgers and Hammerstein flatly refused.) For that matter, Mark Twain imagined Huckleberry Finn rejecting the racism of his society in 1884. Huck lights out for the territory, prepared to go to hell rather than accept the racist tenets of his world. Watchman ends almost a century later with a purely accommodationist image, as Jean Louise learns to stop bumping her head against an unyielding environment.\nSome may argue that dwelling on identity politics obscures other questions, but both books concern identity politics from start to finish, and neither quite achieves the wisdom it seeks. Mockingbird is technically far more accomplished than Watchman, which is a deeply mediocre novel, stylistically, structurally and intellectually. It turns out that revision and hard work matter: two years of serious effort and the help of a clever editor wrought a profound change. Watchman visibly struggles, and fails, to achieve an adult perspective on its characters. Mockingbird settles for entirely mastering a child’s perspective, an achievement that is complete, but limited.\nTo Kill a Mockingbird has always been viewed as a parable about America. Go Set a Watchman is now forcing us to look more squarely at the racism lurking beneath, and we don’t like what we see. Our horror at discovering that Atticus was really a racist may be genuine, but it is also the rage of Caliban, seeing himself in the mirror. “As sure as time,” Uncle Jack tells Jean Louise in one of the book’s best sentences, “history is repeating itself, and as sure as man is man, history is the last place he’ll look for his lessons.” Watchman is nowhere near as good a novel as Mockingbird, but it might prove an equally significant one, if it helps us look to history for our lessons, rather than to our consoling, childish, whitewashed fables.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

His works include the Septology series of novels, Aliss at the Fire, Melancholy and A Shining.\n“His huge oeuvre, spanning a variety of genres, comprises about 40 plays and a wealth of novels, poetry collections, essays, children’s books and translations,” said Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel committee for literature. “Fosse blends a rootedness in the language and nature of his Norwegian background with artistic techniques in the wake of modernism.”\n“I am overwhelmed, and somewhat frightened. I see this as an award to the literature that first and foremost aims to be literature, without other considerations,” Fosse said in a statement.\nHe also told the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK that he was “surprised but also not” to have won. “I’ve been part of the discussion for 10 years and have more and less tentatively prepared myself that this could happen,” he said.\nJacques Testard, Fosse’s fiction publisher, said on hearing the news: “He is an exceptional writer, who has managed to find a totally unique way of writing fiction. As his Norwegian editor Cecilie Seiness put it recently in an interview: if you open any book by Jon and read a couple of lines, it couldn’t be written by anyone else.\n“His fiction is incantatory, mystical, and rooted in the landscape of the western fjords where he grew up,” Testard added. “It’s very important to remember that he writes in Nynorsk or New Norwegian, a minority language in Norway, a political act in itself. He’s also an exceptional playwright and poet. He’s an incredible mind, and it couldn’t have happened to a nicer person.”\nThe Norwegian writer’s English translator Damion Searls said he is thrilled Fosse’s work will now find an even wider audience. “I first brought Fosse’s fiction into English almost 20 years ago. I read Melancholy in German and immediately felt that the work was brilliant and needed to be translated. I found an American publisher and a co-translator, and started learning Norwegian”, he told the Guardian. “I have since translated around 10 books of his, depending on how you count them, including a libretto, a play and a forthcoming children’s book.”\nThough the author and translator mostly communicate via email and hadn’t met in person until the 2022 International Booker prize events in London, Searls considers Fosse a friend. “He is the same kind, wise, modest, friendly, supportive person over email as you would expect from his novels, and corresponding with him has always brought me the same kind of peace and serenity his novels so magically impart.”\nBorn in 1959 in Haugesund on the west coast of Norway, Fosse grew up in Strandebarm. Aged seven, he nearly died in an accident, which he said was “the most important experience” of his childhood and one that “created” him as an artist. In his adolescence, he aspired to be a rock guitarist, before turning his ambitions to writing.\nHis debut novel, Raudt, svart (Red, Black), was published in 1983. His first play to be performed, Og aldri skal vi skiljast (And Never Shall We Part), was staged at the National Theater in Bergen in 1994. Yet, the first play he wrote, Nokon kjem til å komme (Someone Is Going to Come), would lead to his breakthrough in 1999 when French director Claude Régy staged it in Nanterre.\nFosse went on to become the most-performed Norwegian playwright after Henrik Ibsen. He has written more than 30 plays, including Namnet (The Name), Vinter (Winter) and Ein sommars dag (A Summer’s Day). His longer works include the Septology trilogy, the third volume of which was shortlisted for the international Booker prize in 2022.\nSeptology, which Fosse started during a pause from playwriting and after converting to Catholicism in 2013, is about an ageing painter, Asle, living alone on the south-west coast of Norway and reflecting on his life. There in Bjørgvin lives another Asle, who is also a painter but struggles with alcohol. The doppelgangers are consumed by the same existential questions about death, faith and love.\nIn 1989, the same year that Fosse’s novel Naustet (“Boathouse”) came out, the writer taught the fellow Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgård, who was a student at the Academy of Writing in Hordaland. “Fosse’s voice is unmistakable in whatever he writes, and is never anything if not present,” wrote Knausgård in 2019.\nFosse’s UK publisher is Fitzcarraldo Editions, which also publishes Annie Ernaux, the winner of the 2022 Nobel prize in literature. Fosse’s win marks the London-based independent publisher’s third win in five years: Olga Tokarczuk was made laureate in 2018. The prize was postponed and awarded in 2019 instead due to a sexual assault scandal involving the husband of one of the academy’s former members which led to several members resigning.\nFosse resides between Austria and Norway. He will receive the prize at a ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December. He will receive 11m SEK (£821,209), up from 10m SEK awarded last year.\n-\nTo explore all books by Jon Fosse, visit guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply."

    "raw_text": "The game I’m most looking forward to right now is Big Walk, the latest title from House House, creators of the brilliant Untitled Goose Game. A cooperative multiplayer adventure where players are let loose to explore an open world, I’m interested to see what emergent gameplay comes out of it. Could Big Walk allow for a kind of community archaeology with friends? I certainly hope so.\nWhen games use environmental storytelling in their design – from the positioning of objects to audio recordings or graffiti – they invite players to role play as archaeologists. Game designer Ben Esposito infamously joked back in 2016 that environmental storytelling is the “art of placing skulls near a toilet” – which might have been a jab at the tropes of games like the Fallout series, but his quip demonstrates how archaeological gaming narratives can be. After all, the incongruity of skulls and toilets is likely to lead to many questions and interpretations about the past in that game world, however ridiculous.\nI used to work as an archaeologist in the analogue world, where my work consisted of excavations, fieldworks and assessment of potential development sites across the UK. Now I’m doing a computer science PhD focusing in video game archaeology, where I get to come up with novel ways to record gameplay experiences, like doing in-game walking interviews with players in the MMO Wurm Online, or recording the location of player messages in Elden Ring.\nBecause I know what being an archaeologist entails, I often find myself thinking about games that just have you play as a person with that job title, such as Tomb Raider or Uncharted, versus those that have you engage in work similar to what we do in the field. Walking sims like Gone Home and What Remains of Edith Finch invite you to explore a space and interpret what all of the objects left behind in the landscape mean. Dr Melissa Kagen, assistant teaching professor in interactive media and game development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, refers to this interpretive gameplay in walking simulators as “archival adventuring”.\nIt’s not just walking sims though. There is a growing genre of puzzle games that I would argue also puts you in the role of an archaeologist, piecing together clues about the past from material remains and archival material. Some people refer to these games as “Metroidbranias”, but I’m personally quite fond of them. Essentially, “information games” (as developer Tom Francis calls them) require players to come up with theories based on the information they have, to in turn use those theories to acquire more knowledge. With its central mechanic of deciphering an ancient language, Heaven’s Vault is an obvious candidate, but I would argue that other information games like Return of the Obra Dinn, Her Story and Outer Wilds (which literally has a special “archaeologist edition”) also encourage you to role play as an archaeologist, searching for clues in the environment and past records.\nIn my own work I investigate how to preserve contemporary games, as carefully as you would an ancient artefact. So I’ve been thinking a lot about parallels in the game world too: how players record their own experiences through screenshots, map-making and diaries, and these are also methods used by real world archaeologists. Some games use these recording methods as central game mechanics. A great example is Season: A Letter to the Future, in which you document the world on the eve of its destruction in your journal. Games that inspire you to take notes also arguably result in a record of the gameplay experience – a good example is 2025’s puzzle sensation Blue Prince, which explicitly encourages players to record anything interesting they see in each of the clue-filled rooms as they explore an ever-shifting estate.\nRather than raiding tombs, if you want to be a video game archaeologist, look out for those skulls next to toilets. Better yet, record them. A future games archaeologist will thank you!\nWhat to play\nWe’re seeing a lot of classic 80s arcade games being rediscovered at the moment, with Gradius Origins pleasing shoot-em-’up purists and Bandai Namco’s Shadow Labyrinth thrillingly reimagining Pac-Man.\nNext, here comes Sega with Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, a compulsive and stylish adventure platformer based on its classic series of ninja brawlers. A vast range of fighting skills, weapons and combos come into play as you leap across hand-drawn cyberpunk environments, all rich in detail. French developer Lizardcube has done amazing work marrying the old school immediacy of the original titles with modern features and considerable Gallic visual flair. Come for the nostalgia, stay for the blistering execution moves, which let you take out multiple enemies in a claret-soaked dance of death.\nAvailable on: PC, PS4/5, Xbox\nEstimated playtime: 15 hours\nWhat to read\n-\nWant to find out more about Nintendo’s approach to game design? Forthcoming book Super Nintendo, from Pushing Buttons’s own Keza MacDonald, is now available for pre-order. It’s an in-depth look behind the scenes at the legendary game and console maker, with incredible access to the design teams, including Miyamoto himself. Essential stuff.\n-\nOver 450 Diablo developers have voted to unionise, according to theCommunications Workers of America union. As Team 3 Senior Software Engineer Nav Bhetti puts it: “My entire career as a developer has seen my peers and I paying the ‘passion tax’ for working in an industry that we love.”\n-\nHave you heard of “friendslop”? Nicole Carpenter dives into the emerging genre of social games such as Peak, Lethal Company and Content Warning, and asks what developers can learn from their emphasis on essentially messing about with your mates.\nWhat to click\n-\nGhost of Yōtei preview – a determined outsider seeks revenge in feudal Japan\n-\nLittle Problems preview – a cute detective game with no violence or victims\n-\nMythmatch preview – taking on ancient Greek tech bros to rebuild a broken world\n-\nEsoteric Ebb: a Dungeons & Dragons-style campaign that lets you be as stupid as you like\n-\nKeeper is the ecological ‘fever dream’ where you play as – checks notes – a lighthouse\nQuestion Block\nThis week’s straightforward question comes from Richard B via email:\n“Are the console wars over?”\nThis is a question the whole industry seems to be pondering at the moment. In February, Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, told XboxEra that he was no longer looking to take gamers from PlayStation or PC. Three months later, the previously exclusive title Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released on PS5, and Gears of War: Reloaded is also bound for Sony’s platform. Meanwhile, Sony has brought Helldivers 2 to Xbox and more titles are likely to follow, if a recently spotted Sony job advert is to be believed.\nOf course, cross play – the feature of online games such as Fortnite and Apex Legends which allows people to compete against each other whatever machine they’re using – started us off in this direction. Now, in an industry where smartphone gaming is dominating (figures by NewZoo indicate mobile games were worth $92.5bn to the global economy in 2024, compared to $50.3bn for console), and the idea of two games hardware titans expensively competing on proprietary tech and software exclusives seems increasingly anachronistic.\nAnd yet … Gamers are intrinsically territorial and always have been, while brand loyalty is a key facet of fandom (and, let’s face it, capitalism) – see also Nikon v Canon, Nike v Reebok or Android v iPhone. Tech specs are only ever part of these conflicts – style, image and identity come into play too. So don’t expect Xbox and PlayStation to, in the near future, become mere apps on a multitude of faceless platforms. Several battles may be over, but the war lumbers on.\nIf you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – hit reply or email us on pushingbuttons@theguardian.com."

    "raw_text": "Atsu is no samurai. The lead character in Ghost of Yōtei is a wandering sellsword from a lowly family. Her sex and lack of status mean that, following the murders of her family, she has no fixed place in 17th-century Japanese society, and there is no permitted path for her to tread if she is to get revenge on the Yōtei Six, the men who killed her loved ones. As the game’s co-director Nate Fox puts it, “Atsu is not somebody who walks in to a room and people pay respect to.”\nYōtei’s predecessor, Sucker Punch Productions’ 2020 sprawling open-world game Ghost of Tsushima, is the story of a samurai, Jin Sakai, who shreds his honour to defend his homeland. Jin can’t repel the Mongols attacking Tsushima as a noble warrior, but as “the Ghost”, a fear-inspiring legend willing to use any dirty tactic to gain the upper hand, he can. If Ghost of Tsushima is about a man grappling with the trade of one kind of power for another, Yōtei sees Atsu seize the only power she can with both hands.\nAtsu adopts the mantle of an onryō, a revenge spirit from Japanese folklore. By embracing this legend, she becomes a figure of fear to her enemies. While the resulting game is similar to Tsushima – in Ghost of Yōtei you also travel across a romanticised open-world recreation of feudal Japan on horseback, carving up your enemies with precise strokes of your katana – the shift from high-class samurai to vagrant sellsword shows itself in unexpected ways.\n“She has a different life than Jin, and we want to bring that out through interactivity,” Fox says. That means removing Ghost of Tsushima’s contemplative moments, such as those during which Jin would meditate on his surroundings and transform his struggle into haiku. “Jin was a scholarly samurai; he would pause to reflect and take in the beauty of nature. Atsu is not that person.” Those moments softened the rough edges of Tsushima, a mellowing that Sucker Punch doesn’t want to apply to the feral world of Yōtei. Atsu doesn’t write poems; she collects bounties as she hunts down the warriors that stalk Hokkaido.\nSucker Punch also expresses the difference in protagonists with a subtle innovation for open-world games: a movable campsite. “We like creating features that are tonally supportive,” Yōtei’s other game director, Jason Connell, says. “Camping is something you would expect in a world like this.” And Fox adds, “Atsu’s a sellsword used to sleeping rough”.\nAs game worlds have expanded and the numbers of questlines and upgrade trees have multiplied, it has created a barrier of administration between players and the worlds they’re exploring. Instead of moving on foot, they use fast travel to warp between markers on the map. “It’s discordant,” Connell says. One moment you might be in a tropical forest fighting mercenaries, the next you’re on a mountaintop upgrading a weapon before hopping to a beach to deliver a quest item. Atsu’s camp is Sucker Punch’s attempt to redress this disruption and wrap the world around the player. Quest givers, shopkeepers and key characters will now visit you, providing a way to continue your journey without interrupting the flow of the story. “It’s a convenience,” Connell says, “and a more diegetic experience.”\nIn this way, Yōtei is set to be both an evolution of Ghost of Tsushima and an inversion. Set 300 years after the first game and on the other side of Japan, with the player wearing the sandals of a character from the opposite end of society, it promises to be a familiar world filled with unexpected change."

    "raw_text": "As the latest generation of 18-year-olds is about to find out, starting university is an experience fraught with minor as well as major problems. Oversleeping and missing lectures, forgetting where your study group is meeting, mislaying your books – a lot of your time is spent looking for things.\nIt is these small mysteries that concern Little Problems, a cute detective game, in which the protagonist, Mary, must use her sleuthing abilities to make it through each day as a new student . Created by Indonesian designer Melisa, who has chosen to go by her first name only, the idea comes from her love of detective stories, but also her wish to take violence out of the genre.\n“I read detective comic books, novels and manga, and have been playing detective games since I was a kid. I like horror as well, so I originally thought it would be a great idea to develop a detective game with a horror aesthetic. But after a few weeks of consuming murder and horror stories 24/7, I began to feel depressed, like the world was such a dark place. I wanted to make a story about good people who grow up and make mistakes. This game is all about that nice fuzzy feeling you get from solving small life mysteries.”\nIn short, there is no criminal activity here. Sometimes, it is just about Mary trying to find a favourite earring, a friend in the crowd – or her mischievous cat. Each scene works like a hidden object puzzle game; you search a location for clues, which may be photos, notes or schedules, and then deduce what has happened. Who broke your favourite mug? You need to check what was in it, then use information about what your housemates like to drink and if they were around at the right time to find the culprit. Surely this is the most relatable crime ever investigated in a video game.\nThe wholesome, low-stakes feel is accentuated by an art style that draws inspiration from soft manga and anime such as Doraemon, Chibi Maruko-chan and Kobo-chan. As with similarly domestic titles such as Unpacking and A Little to the Left, there is a lot of subtle storytelling going on in the background around friendships and family, giving weight to the simple premise. Melisa started the project as a quick prototype for a Twitch game jam, but ended up spending two years on it, bringing two other staff onboard and setting up her studio, Posh Cat. It has been something of a passion project. “I would love to play more cosy detective games, so I made one,” she says. “Here’s to more cosy games in 2025 and beyond!”"

    "raw_text": "One of the most interesting trends in game design is the use of familiar mechanics and genres to explore real-world power systems and how to challenge them. Forthcoming deck-building game, All Will Rise, seeks to interest players in political activism, Compensation Not Guaranteed aims to educate players about south-east Asian politics, while MythMatch is ostensibly a puzzle game set in ancient Greece, but is also about building communities and challenging capitalism – while still looking cute and approachable.\nYou play as Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, who is having to navigate the institutionalised sexism of Mount Olympus, here represented as a corporation infested with tech bros. In defiance, she decides to help the mortals of Ithaca build a new, more progressive world – and you do this by running around the little environments, merging items and animals to create helpful new beasts and objects. For example, when you’re cast down to Earth you accidentally smash a chariot belonging to Selene, the goddess of the Moon, so you have to match moon shards together to recreate the celestial vehicle. However, one of the shards has fallen into a greenhouse, so you need to solve a puzzle to gain access.\nThe game then is part narrative adventure, part social sim, part match-three teaser. “We ended up taking a lot more from automation games like Factorio, but where the automation happens through connection with the NPCs rather than building machinery,” says Moo Yu, founder and creative director at developer Team Artichoke. “And in Mount Olympus, we’re inspired by various arcade-style games like Money Puzzle Exchanger, Overcooked, and even Super Auto Pets.”\nWith a diverse bunch of characters and a genuinely funny script, the emphasis is very much on forming friendships and a pleasant community. “I became obsessed with the theme of belonging,” says Yu. “As someone who has always struggled to make friends or find community, I just felt like there weren’t enough games about rejection and found family. So I started with some gameplay about moving goalposts and constantly being rejected by the gods of Olympus. Then when searching for where Artemis might actually fit in, I thought about some of the communities that I love and how they are about aligning our commonalities while embracing our differences.”\nTeam Artichoke is a small studio with 10 staff, most of whom are working part-time on the project. At the helm, Yu is a veteran who’s worked at Media Molecule and Mind Candy as well as co-developing the hit adventure Knights and Bikes. When asked about the key influences behind Mythmatch, he immediately cites three films: Kung Fu Panda, Amelie and most prominently Legally Blonde, the Reese Witherspoon comedy which is visually coded to look like a romcom but also deftly analyses misogyny in the legal profession. “We wanted to create a caricatured world to give us the breathing space to venture on to more serious topics,” he says. “[There’s] a surface cuteness but with a layer of grittiness throughout. So while the game might not literally look like the world of Legally Blonde, we wanted to capture the space created by the exaggerated colour palette while also making sure there was a layer of messiness as well.”\nSo while Mythmatch uses the core game loops of casual genres such as match-three and merge games, it has a fundamental message to impart about power and belonging. Yu sees this combination as important in the indie games scene of 2025. “I’m seeing more small games that are delivering new stories or pairing mechanics with interesting narratives that I think speaks to what creativity can accomplish with limited funds,” he says. “I wish the funds weren’t getting more and more limited, but I am always inspired by what people can accomplish with what they can scrape together.”"

    "raw_text": "There are two types of horror – one that shocks you into more inventive ways to hide behind a pillow; and the other that creeps under your skin, quietly prickling the back of your neck and haunting you for weeks. The Séance Of Blake Manor falls into that second camp: an atmospheric take on an 1890s Irish murder mystery.\nYou play Detective Ward, who has been sent to the titular Blake Manor to investigate the disappearance of Evelyn Deane two nights before a seance is due take place. Mystics from across the globe have gathered at the crumbling mansion to converse with the dead on All Hallows’ Eve, but are they really capable of doing what they say they can? And what was that shadowy figure? There’s more than one secret to unravel.\n“Think of it as gothic or folk horror,” says narrative lead Dave McCabe. “It’s that creeping dread that you’re in a place you shouldn’t be and every step you take isn’t safe.”\nTime ticks down as you explore the house and talk to each of the guests, so you need to work hard to figure out what’s happening. Sometimes you’ll need to solve puzzles by moving objects or finding hidden passwords. Other times you’ll need to be in the right place at the right time to catch crucial information.\nPermeating all that mystery and Victorian spiritualism is a miasma of Irish folklore. “We picked one key point in Irish mythology for the setup of our story,” says Paul Conway, lead artist and CEO of developer Spooky Doorway. “It’s why this particular place is the nexus of ancient magic and supernatural events, but I can’t say what it is without revealing too much!”\n“We definitely touch on a lot of Irish mythology, pagan beliefs and ghost stories,” McCabe adds. While those aspects don’t always directly affect the story, that otherworldly presence lingers in the background. Irish traditions, such as carved turnips that are far more monstrous than the pumpkins of today’s Halloween, are dotted around the estate. You encounter a flash of something early on, and the library is rammed full of old tales and legends to peruse at your leisure. Just don’t take too long, or your time to solve the mystery will run out.\nThe developers are proud of their heritage and want to inspire players to explore more of it. “I hope it adds another layer to the perception people have of Ireland and Irish history – that it’s not all St Patrick’s Day and flat caps,” McCabe says. “And maybe some people will come over and see a few haunted castles.”"

    "raw_text": "Dungeons & Dragons is a rich playground of fantastical tales where warriors, wizards and elves can take on monstrous foes for unimaginable spoils … or you can spend an entire evening completely undermining your dungeon master by killing off important characters, focusing on unrelated items and improvising your own disastrous adventure. This is often where the best stories are and where Esoteric Ebb takes its inspiration.\nPart tabletop game, part RPG, you play as a cleric who has been sent to investigate the destruction of a tea shop in the city Norvik, which is about to hold its first ever election in five days. You’ll talk (and occasionally fight) with the local residents to uncover the truth and affect the outcome of the election. Or perhaps you’ll just fight some seagulls. You can choose your own path, but, much like in D&D, your success comes down to dice rolls and having to live with the consequences if you fail them.\n“Every single choice available in the game is something that I anticipated,” says writer and developer Christoffer Bodegård. It’s particularly impressive because every interaction in even a tiny area of the game feels so open-ended. All of the dialogue choices and touching of random objects have been thoughtfully considered by Bodegård to give the feeling of freedom in a confined space. The experience of playing D&D and your players doing unexpected things has come together in the game.\nAs a cleric you may be taking on the role of a detective, but you can cast spells to read people’s minds to gain an advantage or even speak to the dead to uncover other lines of inquiry. Your cleric is entirely your own as you can customise their accessories – and their personality, with classic D&D stats such as charisma and strength. You could make yourself strong but with low intelligence so you might win a fight but not be smart enough to get a truthful answer out of anyone because your dice rolls can never get high enough.\n“At some point I was like, well, I play so much D&D, why not just make my own homebrew?” Bodegård says. “I wanted to do something entirely different, and that’s what inspired the basis of the world of Esoteric Ebb, which is just taking D&D and looking at it from a weird, esoteric, realistic angle. Like, what if these spells actually did exist? How would governments form? How would various powers exist in relation to these actual D&D mechanics? If we can create food and water from a spell, how does that affect the economy? And just looking at it from that perspective.”\nNorvik may look like a small, medieval-style city on the surface, but because so much consideration has been put into how the place works with its various political parties and citizens, it feels like a real place. Just one with monsters working at shops, and magic. Bodegård’s focus on the depth of the setting and the sheer scope of all the dialogue choices makes for an enticing prospect. “As long as I’m entertained by the thing I’m writing, I can keep writing, and the second I’m bored, I stop.”"

    "raw_text": "Keeper is staking a bold claim to be the oddest game ever published by Microsoft. The setting is weird: an iridescent, far-future imagining of New England where organic and non-organic matter mingle in strange, alchemical ways. And the characters are undeniably quirky: one is a bird called Twig whose beak is made from driftwood. Strangest of all: you play as a lighthouse that has inexplicably become animate, sprouting tiny, spindly little legs to carry its wibbling, wobbling body.\nIn the sea of action-hero young men and, to a lesser degree, women, the lighthouse stands out as an unlikely star. Creative lead Lee Petty is a little fuzzy on the details of how it came to be. Rather, he talks about the creation of the protagonist as he does the broader action-adventure experience: as if it rose out of his subconscious. Despite the ostensible absurdity, Petty believes there is a certain intuition about it. “You have a light, and light has a very strong connection with life,” he says. “You can imagine the verbs for the player, and the actions, puzzles, mechanics that fall out of that.”\nThe lighthouse’s illuminated beacon is the primary way you interact with the game’s teeming island setting. In “unfocused” mode, you direct the beam about a fantastical environment, causing foliage and small creatures to grow, change and morph. In “focused” mode, the light’s power is concentrated: larger objects undergo transformation while some materials are repelled or attracted; this is the basis of the game’s more involved puzzles.\nKeeper’s world is one of gauzy, psychedelic purples and deep, verdant greens. We see bioluminescent rock formations, tree-sized tendrils protruding from their gigantic flower heads, and a gorgeous, whale-like creature floating through the sky, vegetation growing unexpectedly on its back. This ecological extravaganza is partly inspired by 1980s fantasy movies such as The Dark Crystal and The NeverEnding Story, “weird” and “imperfect” works, admits Petty, yet “so earnest in their desire to create a world that you haven’t seen before”.\nReal life proved just as inspiring for the creative lead. During Covid lockdowns, he walked alone in the pretty foothills south of his San Francisco home. Petty gazed at the abundant vegetation while meditating on what the planet might look like should humanity cease to exist. He was also reading books and watching movies about mycelium networks, thinking deeply about the interconnectedness and interdependence of ecosystems.\nThis deluge of feelings, real-world circumstances and reference material coalesced as a fever dream, says Petty. He envisioned a “a weird island, a sort of surreal, post-human thing, where life has continued to evolve in completely unexpected ways”.\nThe game’s genesis arrived shortly after Petty’s award-winning employer Double Fine, maker of trippy platformer Psychonauts 2, Stacking and many other idiosyncratic titles, was acquired by Microsoft. The new management was receptive to his experimental idea: he was given the time and resources to explore the concept before locking down its form. Keeper seems to have embodied the laid-back approach of its making: the vibe is languorously dreamy with many opportunities to slow down and smell the enchanting and totally bizarre roses.\n“You’re not rushed along, you’re not given mission objectives. There are no pop-ups on the screen with meta-rewards,” says Petty. “You’re kind of left to dwell in the space.”\nAnd yet there is a grim irony that may yet sour this sweet, whimsical experience: Keeper’s vivid celebration of life is being funded by Microsoft at a time when the company’s cloud-based storage platform Azure has been used to facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes and military operations in Gaza and the West Bank. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has called for the boycott of Microsoft and Xbox products. Recently, unionised workers at French studio Arkane, also owned by Microsoft, issued an open letter stating that its parent company “has no place being accomplice of a genocide”.

He says this is the “downside” of being owned by a much larger organisation, one whose purview extends far beyond entertainment. “I’m not in control.

    "raw_text": "Entering the almost silent rehearsal room, I fear I’ve blundered into a private moment. The Lady from the Sea cast are seated in a tight circle and at least two of them have tears in their eyes. The quiet murmur of conversation suggests something heavy has just gone down. So I’m relieved when I realise they’re reading a scene – and stunned to discover the scene was written only yesterday.\nSimon Stone’s modern take on Ibsen’s play is still under construction, and he has had his actors together for less than a fortnight. “Most people really take six weeks to connect to scenes,” the Australian writer-director says during the lunch break. “Often an entire rehearsal process can be the slow marking out of stuff, and it takes until your first run-through to feel anything at all. We are connecting faster, because we’ve been talking about it so much.”\nAfter workshopping the characters with his actors, Stone writes dialogue based at least partly on their conversations, sometimes only the night before they rehearse it. It’s an approach that has inspired some memorably intense performances. A blistering Yerma was a career-defining moment for Billie Piper in 2016. Two years ago, Janet McTeer sent tremors around the National Theatre’s Lyttelton stage in an updated version of the Phaedra myth.\nIn today’s hot seat – or, to be accurate, leather sofa – Andrew Lincoln and Alicia Vikander are playing a couple whose married life is derailed by the return of the wife’s long-lost lover. “The way Simon works is sort of the opposite of my training,” says Lincoln, who had a long hiatus from the stage while starring in nine seasons of The Walking Dead. “It’s like you start at the end. But there’s no bullshit, he blows all of that away, and it’s been one of the most remarkable and enlightening things I’ve done in years.”\nThat’s lucky, because Lincoln wasn’t completely sold on Ibsen’s play. He laughs that he was “ambushed” into the role of Edward – it was only halfway through their initial meeting that he even realised he was being offered a gig. “There’s a thriller aspect to the original that I loved. But I honestly think it’s oppressive. When someone mentions Ibsen to me, I don’t think of gut-belly laughs. But Simon’s got a track record.”\nStone’s modern tragedies are shot through with humour and today’s rehearsal is a case in point: Gracie Oddie-James and Isobel Akuwudike, in particular, fizz with comic chemistry as Edward’s daughters. The writer throws himself back in his chair with a huge cackle and wheezes with laughter even at what sound like serious parts. He watches intently as the scenes unfold in front of him and only occasionally interrupts with advice – say it slower, be more casual, come in faster – teasing out the musicality of the lines like a conductor.\nAt lunch, Vikander is none the worse for a morning spent being shouted at by her fictional spouse: if anything, it seems to have delighted her. This is the first time the 36-year-old Oscar-winner has been in a theatre production since she was a teenager. “On a film the clock is ticking, because you know that you have three scenes in two days. Here it is such a joy because I have these wonderful nerves every day, from still not really understanding what we’re going to do in front of people.”\nHer mother, Maria, was a theatre actor, and Vikander herself trained as a ballet dancer: she never even imagined a screen career. “There’s no one saying ‘cut!’, so I really can lose myself in it all. I’m doing the thing I dreamed of as a kid. It’s a real high.” The one thing she was most apprehensive about was whether her voice would reach across the Bridge theatre’s auditorium. Stone reassures her: “You could do a 2,000-seater if you wanted to, Alicia.”\nVikander knew the play already – she had seen a production in her home country of Sweden, and loved its radical feminism. Her first encounter with Stone – over Zoom while she was shooting a forthcoming film in Korea with her husband, Michael Fassbender – was an intense and revelatory conversation that only ended when they realised it was 1.30am where the actor was (Stone says he left the chat feeling “wonderfully embarrassed”).\nHis works often contain autobiographical elements, albeit heavily disguised; he calls it “photocopies of photocopies of photocopies”. Lady from the Sea is no different. He first read Ibsen’s original in 2009, two months after encountering a similar situation in his own life. “I had been one half of a relationship that went through that,” says Stone. “I started reading this five-act play in the bath and I just couldn’t stop. By the end, the water was completely cold.”\n“I love that you were in the bath,” Vikander comments. “Very appropriate.”\nStone’s stage productions – Yerma, Medea, Phaedra – are testament to the fact that he is more interested in female heroes than male ones. “When I started out I thought I would do just one or two plays focused on women. But it’s become pretty much everything [I do].” It’s why he is so drawn to Ibsen: “When you think that his female characters were written 150 years back, it’s extraordinary. And this from a man in his 50s and 60s. You just go – what?”\nThe dramatic tension in The Lady from the Sea arises from the fact that the female protagonist is emotionally split in two – something Vikander can relate to. She has two sons, aged four and one, with Fassbender, and still feels guilty when she has to leave them for long days on set. Her grandmother worked – which was considered unusual at the time – and her mother’s earnings were often spent on the childcare she needed when she performed: “I don’t even know how she was able to pay rent,” says Vikander.\nShe looks back with huge gratitude for an upbringing that modelled how a woman could be a fully committed artist and a loving, present mother. “She would get up at 4am to bake bread, because her mum never cooked for her,” she remembers. “And I’ve realised that to be the best mum, I also need to make sure I have this other thing that makes me the person I am.”\nLincoln, who is 51, has developed his own important work-life rules. One is to do his research on the directors he works with: “The question you always ask is, ‘Are they a shouter?’ Life is too short to work with people that are going to be oppressive or unkind.”\nHe talked to his friend Piper, whose work in Yerma he had admired, before committing to working with Stone. “She said, ‘It’ll be probably one of the most intense and frightening experiences, but you have to do it.’ It changed the way she worked for ever, and it gave her legitimacy that she felt she didn’t have before.”\nLincoln is thrilled with the role that Stone has written for him; he has also, he says, noticed that he has entered the time of life where he is asked to play cuckolds. “But even when you were young, you were the other man,” says Stone. “Look at Love Actually!” Lincoln nods: when he made a film about Apollo 11 he played Michael Collins, the only astronaut on that mission who didn’t get to land on the moon. “Maybe I’m just the guy that doesn’t get the golden ticket.”\nStone observes that that was the reason audiences adored James Stewart – the characters he played somehow accepted being second best. “But in this play it’s like we cast Jimmy Stewart to go, ‘I don’t want to be Jimmy Stewart any more’,” says Stone. “That’s what I love about it.”\nWith lunch over, the director must hustle away and leave his cast to a group-led rehearsal: delays on his latest Netflix film mean he will spend this afternoon in a Soho editing suite. The Woman in Cabin 10, released next month, is his third movie (his first, The Daughter, was based on Ibsen’s The Wild Duck, and his most recent, The Dig, starred Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes). In a complete coincidence, it’s set in the North Sea, and even climaxes in Norway. “I didn’t know we were making a sequel,” jokes Vikander.\nIt all adds to the impression that a Stone production can be a seat-of-the-pants ride for those involved. Vikander, making what is to all intents her professional stage debut, admits to knowing no different. “I think I came in extremely open,” she says, “and I’m discovering more each day. I feel as bare and real as I would in a film.”"

    "raw_text": "In one fell – but felicitous – swoop, Simon Stone has remade Lorca for the English stage. Completely in tune with the Young Vic’s policy of bringing craic to the classics, the 31-year-old Australian director and writer has performed improbable surgery on Yerma, Lorca’s 1934 play about a woman who cannot conceive. He has stripped it of washerwomen, shepherds, poetic effusions. He has transplanted the action from rural Spain to present-day London, and made its heroine a lifestyle journalist and blogger. He shows the yearning of the central figure, the pressure that builds up around her, and the desperation that engulfs her, as utterly contemporary.\nNot him alone. Billie Piper, the least dried-up of actresses, is earth-quaking in the title role: yerma is Spanish for barren. She scythes through the different registers of the play with her unique combination of slangy poise and bunched-up physicality. She begins twinkling away with arch knowingness as one half of a pampered couple. She moves – surprising herself with her wish for a child – to banshee fury and to druggy dislocation. Frustrated, she paws the ground with her foot like an impatient pony.\nIt would have been so easy for this reimagining of Yerma to be glib. It is not. Piper’s character is neither satirised nor indulged. Sympathies slide between her and her partner, wonderfully played by Brendan Cowell with a mixture of innocent affection and casual incomprehension. Crucial to the production’s triumph are its manoeuvres in and out of naturalism. This is loyal to Lorca. Though the speech is totally secular and 21st-century, the drama has a liturgical movement. It is a requiem for lost hope. Stefan Gregory’s soundscape and music thrum between scenes, which are captioned, Brecht-style, with dates and headlines on a screen: “A year later”, “An ex reappeared”. The heroine’s confessional blog nods at Catholicism.\nLizzie Clachan’s extraordinary design encloses the stage in transparent walls. It could be a glass case to display a jewelled life, a fragile bubble, a membrane, or a shrine. Lorca’s watery fertility images are suggested in miraculously swift set changes. A bare house becomes a garden which is first verdant, then shrivelled. A mud-clogged Glastonbury looks like the home of the damned.\nThe great Maureen Beattie is perfectly acerbic in the unusual role of an academic mother for whom being pregnant was like being invaded by an alien. Charlotte Randle is subtle and wan as a kind, disappointed sister, and John McMillan beguiling as a former lover. Thalissa Teixeira, recently outstanding in the Royal Exchange’s The Night Watch, dazzles.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Euripides’ Medea was first performed in Athens, in 431BC– and it came last in a competition. Within a year, though, it was one of the most performed plays in Greece. Its intensity, devastating relevance and relentless climax have not lessened over time.\nSimon Stone’s version is not a translation of Euripides, but a loose adaptation (described as being “after Euripides”) that draws on other sources, including the true case of a US doctor, Debora Green, who murdered two of her children in 1995. It is easily the best version of Medea that I’ve seen on the London stage in two decades.\nThis adaptation is by Internationaal Theater Amsterdam (English surtitles appear on a huge screen, on which some of the action is also projected), and it is funny, clever, and harrowing in equal measure. Most modern productions of Euripides depict Medea as mad by the end of the play; they assume audiences could not accept any other explanation of why a woman would kill her children.\nThis version begins with Anna (the characters are all renamed) being allowed out of the mental hospital where she has spent the last year. She has done something terrible to her husband, Lucas, who is having an affair with a much younger woman, Clara. Anna begins a devastating process of trying to win him back.\nBob Cousins’ set is a huge white box, around which Anna (a deservedly award-winning performance by Marieke Heebink) swaggers, in and out of control. Like everything else about this adaptation, the changes made from the Euripidean model are thoughtful and perfectly judged. This Medea isn’t mad because only a mad woman could kill children. She is mad because the life she has created with Lucas has exacerbated her frailties and demolished her strength. Their great fight in Euripides is partly about Medea’s superior cleverness. Here, she screams at Lucas for stealing her scientific research and passing it off as his own. “I’m sorry,” he yells. “Have some fucking dignity,” she replies.\nThe staging is brutal, leaving the performers nowhere to hide. They don’t need it: this flawless ensemble have created a raw masterpiece.\n-\nAt the Barbican, London, until 9 March\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Simon Stone does things differently. As a young director he was described as the enfant terrible of Australian theatre. He’s 38 years old now so no longer an “enfant”, while his reputation has spread far beyond Australia and beyond theatre, too, into film and opera. But a few days before interviewing him, I overhear two members of his latest ensemble discussing how disconcerting it is to work with him. They’ve not experienced anything like it, they say. They’re never quite sure when rehearsals will begin, because he spends every morning writing that day’s scenes.\nCan this really be any more than an excuse for being a chronic oversleeper, I ask, when we meet after his sixth day of rehearsals for his version of Phaedra at the National Theatre. He laughs and says that this very morning he was up early writing with his five-month-old daughter on his knee. “And she kept just sort of typing, with me having to correct the typos that she was making.” The point, he adds, is not to put actors on the spot, but to enable them to collaborate in the creation of the text from day to day through their improvisations in the rehearsal room.\nIt’s not that he’s writing a new play, but as anyone lucky enough to have seen his electrifying production of Yerma in 2016 will tell you, his stock in trade is to so totally reconceive old ones that he might as well be. For Yerma, at the Young Vic, he teamed up with the actor Billie Piper to present Lorca’s Andalucian peasant girl as a modern woman driven mad by her inability to conceive, despite multiple rounds of IVF. Two years earlier at Ivo van Hove’s Internationaal Theater Amsterdam, he reimagined Medea as a biochemist with two children and a cheating husband who not has only deserted her for a younger woman but has taken credit for all of her research.\nSo what will he do with Janet McTeer as Phaedra, the Cretan princess who was married to Theseus and whose tragedy was to fall in love with her stepson Hippolytus? It’s a myth that drops like a plumb line through millennia, from Sophocles and Euripides in ancient Greece, to Seneca in Rome, Racine in 17th-century France and any number of 20th-century interpreters, each of whom have brought the preoccupations of their own times and places to bear on it.\nStone will use it to pull aside the invisibility cloak that enfolds women as they slide towards the menopause, in one of the great cultural injustices of the modern age. “I’ve spent a lot of time talking to and reflecting on postmenopausal women who feel eradicated,” he says. “They realise they’re not being seen any more, and that their sexuality has been deleted from the public eye. There have, of course, been all sorts of hormonal changes, but their sexuality doesn’t feel like it has diminished, and in some cases it’s increased. But that feels very at odds with the way we talk about potency. And that word in itself has implications of reproductivity in it, so in some ways it can’t even be applied metaphorically to a woman who is no longer capable of reproduction.”\nIsn’t it astonishing, he adds, that even in the modern world the sexual narrative is still somehow linked to heterosexual reproduction. “But of course, reproduction is inherently heterosexual, in its cliched, old-fashioned connotation. So it all becomes very heteronormative and very, very patriarchal, just in the casual way that that world talks about and represents and celebrates sexuality in 50-plus women.”\nTalking to Stone is an unusual combination of drought and tsunami. He thinks intently, looks pained, and then launches into floods of thought that have clearly burst up from some deep part of himself. Ever since he directed his first play as a 22-year-old actor, he has been drawn to the stories of women, he says. “I think if I were to analyse myself I would say that a lot of it is related to feeling that I can associate emotionally and rationally with the female side of my imagination much more than I do with the male side of my personality.”\nHe’s aware that in the current culture wars around gender and patriarchal oppression, this is contested territory. “I have long hair but I also have a massive beard and I’m in a heterosexual relationship. It’s really difficult to talk about because it’s such a sensitive topic for so many people for various different reasons. But my heroes are women. And when you’re writing plays with heroes in them, you want to be able to write one that you really respect and admire. I find that easier to do with women than I do with men.”\nOne result of this, he admits, is that “my men are very attenuated. If you studied all of my plays, you would always see a man who is unresolved, underdeveloped and unfinished, who doesn’t have the paradoxical nuance that his female counterpart has, because that’s my experience of masculinity: it is attenuated.”\nHe has come to the conclusion that he suffers from gender dyslexia. “I often introduce women as him and men as her, and I used to feel embarrassed by it.” In a bid to explain the origins of this, he tracks back to an early childhood experience in Switzerland, where he was born, one of three children, to a biochemist father and a veterinary scientist mother. He was about five years old, and trailing up the stairs of their apartment block behind his two sisters, when a boy who lived downstairs asked what he was doing with a doll. ”I looked down and realised that the boys in the playground didn’t play with dolls, but in my family all three of us had one of our own.”\nWhen he was 12, his father died suddenly, leaving him in a family of women. The only two men he could stand to be around were a gay uncle and his partner, and as a teenager in Australia he came out as gay himself, “because I thought that was the only way that I could be a man and be as tender, effeminate, expressive, open, carefree as I wanted to be”.\nInconveniently, he kept having dreams about women. Eventually, he says, he had to come out as straight to his gay friends, which was embarrassing in case they thought he had been faking it, but luckily they understood, because “let’s face it, not a lot of guys in Australia in the 1990s would choose to be gay”.\nHis confusion over his sexuality did not extend to his sense of vocation, which was clear and driven from an early age. Through his teens he read plays voraciously, at a rate of four or five a week; by 15 he had found himself an agent, and by 16 was earning decent money as an actor in TV series and commercials. Drama school, he says, taught him how to behave like a man. “They need men to play male roles, so I kind of took on the physicality that I have nowadays.” But, far from sorting him out, the transformation made him “incredibly boring for about five years. Like, really, really boring. I became one-dimensional and constricted, judging myself before I said anything in case it would come across as camp or, you know, as the person that I actually want to be.”\nAt 22, his frustration at the sort of acting roles he was being offered led him to try his hand at directing, and he set up his own company theatre company in Melbourne, the Hayloft Project, launching it with a production of Frank Wedekind’s Spring Awakening, and working his way through a European repertoire that included Chekhov, Ibsen and Nikolai Erdman. Simultaneously, Stone says, “through my 20s I was figuring out how to just be me”.\nBy his early 30s he had arrived where he wanted to be – back in Europe, as a regular director at Theater Basel, in the city where he was born. He made his film directing debut in 2015 with The Daughter, based on Ibsen’s tragedy The Wild Duck, which had become his international calling card when he directed a stage version at Sydney’s Belvoir Street theatre. He went on to make The Dig (2021), starring Carey Mulligan as the landowner whose determination led to the excavation of an Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo.\nFor the past eight years, Stone has been based in Vienna with his dramaturg wife, Stefanie Hackl, but the couple have recently moved to London with their baby daughter. “I had to keep leaving home to be where I worked. And then I realised that the one place in the world where I probably wouldn’t have to leave home very much is London, because film, theatre and opera are all in the same place.”\nIn April he will make his Covent Garden debut with a new opera, Innocence, by the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho, about a school shooting, which premiered at the Aix-en-Provence festival in 2021. “‘It’s my opera version of The Lion King. It’s going everywhere in the world,” he says. It extended his collaborative practice into an evolving musical work. “When I started working on the project there was just a libretto, and I hadn’t heard any of it by the time I designed it. Kaija saw the design and then kept writing this miraculous music.”\nBut first comes Phaedra, a tantalising glimpse of which is offered by a steamy teaser featuring McTeer and Assaad Bouab as versions of Phaedra and Hippolytus. “I was so interested in the idea of a woman who falls in love with a younger man and discovers her desire again – the excitement and rush of such a loss of control, and the idea that you could have a second chance in life,” says Stone. “Of course it’s a crazy act of amour fou, but like all of the Greek myths it’s an exorcism of the self-destructive potential in all of us.”"

    "raw_text": "The Dig is actually not a very earthy film, though there is intelligence and sensitivity and a good deal of English restraint and English charm, thoroughly embodied by the fine leading performers Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes. But the passions mostly stay buried, and the movie is disconcertingly structured in such a way that we are first asked to invest in these two intriguingly complex personalities, but then – just when their emotions might get disinterred – the focus shifts to a younger pair with more obvious romantic potential, played by Johnny Flynn and Lily James. Mulligan and Fiennes look like two characters who have been written out of their own soap opera. This doesn’t stop The Dig being engaging, and with a beautiful sense of landscape.\nIt is based on the true story of the sensational Sutton Hoo excavation in Suffolk on the eve of the second world war; an Anglo-Saxon burial ship was found by the self-taught working-class archaeologist Basil Brown, whose historic discovery the academic establishment instantly tried to appropriate, without credit. He had been hired by the local landowner and widow Edith Pretty, who had long nursed an instinct that there was something in the “mounds” on her property. The movie is vigorously adapted by screenwriter Moira Buffini from the 2007 novel by journalist and author John Preston – whose aunt Margaret Piggott was involved in the dig.\nRalph Fiennes plays Brown, a tough, self-reliant man of few words and an outdoor tan, who does a fair bit of pipe-filling, pipe-smoking and pipe-biting. Fiennes plays him as someone who knows his worth, and he insists on getting two pounds a week from Mrs Pretty for his work and for his lifetime’s knowledge. Mulligan is Edith Pretty: intelligent, beautiful, lonely and mysteriously moved by what Brown is uncovering and by Brown’s own quietly messianic sense of purpose. But then the grand folk from London arrive, intent on taking possession of their precious discovery: Ken Stott is on great form as the pompous British Museum archaeologist Charles Phillips, his face as fierce and red as a toby jug. But along with Phillips is the mousy scholar Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin), a dull fellow who is failing to satisfy his young wife Margaret (Lily James) emotionally. And she is attracted to Edith’s (fictional) cousin Rory (Johnny Flynn).\nOf course, the idea of digging up the past and dredging up what has been emotionally buried in one’s heart saturates the entire film. A Suffolk local takes a dim view of Edith’s encouragement of Brown and remarks that he “should leave Mrs Pretty’s mounds alone!” That’s the Finbarr Saunders school of metaphor.\nBut actually, in that vulgar figurative sense, he pretty much does leave Mrs Pretty’s mounds alone. Her tentative offer of dinner is complicated by the fact that Basil is married to a woman called May, shrewdly played by Monica Dolan, and there is also a secret sadness and vulnerability in Edith’s own heart that would appear to preclude any such developments, though Mrs Pretty’s young son Robert (Archie Barnes) might well be seeing Basil as a father figure.\nThis movie has Englishness right through it like a stick of rock, a vigorous sense of place and period, though it’s in the vein of hardback/tasteful cinema that’s a bit of a Brit movie cliche. Carey Mulligan gets the traditional hat-and-coat walk through the busy wartime London streets that was awarded to Gemma Arterton in Their Finest and Keira Knightley in The Imitation Game. The story itself is rooted in the robust literary tradition of LP Hartley, Bruce Chatwin, Graham Swift and Ian McEwan – with some Larkinian musing at the end about what will survive of us in a thousand years. Margaret tells Rory that in their case, it will the metal wheels in his watch and perhaps some fragments of their china tea mugs. No nonsense about love.\nThe first act about Edith and Basil is arresting and the discovery scene is great – but where will their relationship go? The second act gives us a young love story with much less depth. But maybe that is the point. Edith and Basil have their moment and it is destined to be buried by the newcomers and the vast obliterative forces of history."

    "raw_text": "The first part of a trilogy that will conclude the massively popular anime series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, this latest smash hit from Ufotable, directed by Haruo Sotozaki, is a spectacular treat. For those new to the franchise, the story is set during a mythical imagining of the Taisho era, where hordes of carnivorous demons descend on innocent civilians. Fighting in the name of his massacred family and a sister infected with demon blood, teenage protagonist Tanjiro Kamado joins the Demon Slayer Corps, determined to wipe these ruthless beasts off the Earth. The film picks up from a thrilling cliffhanger of the fourth season, where Tanjiro and his fellow comrades are thrust into the lair of the demon-in-chief, the cunning and all-powerful Muzan Kibutsuji.\nMuch of the film is structured around various battles between the series regulars and their sworn enemies. The challenge of sustaining the narrative is tempered by the use of flashbacks, providing a backstory for each of the formidable foes. Though packed with emotional impact, such detours occasionally hamper the pacing of the combat sequences, which are the film’s visual highlights. Each demon slayer is armed with a specific breath and fighting technique, which manifests into flows of water, fire, and thunder imagery, providing a striking contrast to the cavernous design of Muzan’s Infinity Castle. The latter, evoking perhaps the endless staircases of MC Escher albeit with a Japanese flair, is a handsomely animated spectacle where corridors and hallways fold into one another like endless labyrinths, while fusuma and shoji screens function as trap doors used to throw the demon slayers into unimaginable dangers.\nThe galvanising score, which ranges from orchestral to electronic, further heightens the stakes of life and death. While ardent fans might wish to see more of Muzan, this wonderful instalment gives a splendid taste of what is surely soon to come."

    "raw_text": "Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Sabrina Carpenter triumphed at the MTV Video Music awards, taking home two moonman trophies each in a relatively muted show that once again largely celebrated female pop artists and legacy acts.\nGaga, the most nominated artist of the evening with 12 nods, took home the first award at Long Island’s UBS arena, for artist of the year, winning over fellow superstars Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny and Beyoncé, all of whom were not in attendance.\nThe Disease singer dedicated the award to the audience and her partner, Michael Polansky, then dashed off to the final show on her Mayhem tour at Madison Square Garden.\n“I cannot begin tell you what this means to me,” the singer said, dressed in a baroque black gown. “I hope as you navigate through the mayhem of daily life, you are reminded of the importance of the art of your life, that you can count on yourself and your simple skills to keep you whole.”\nGaga’s absence was one of many in a three-hour show that was relatively light on star power and awards. The ceremony was emceed by a largely off-screen LL Cool J and handed out only seven awards during the telecast, all of them to female artists and Bruno Mars for his collaborations with two female artists: his duet with Lady Gaga, Die With A Smile, won best collaboration, while Apt, his track with Blackpink member Rosé, was crowned song of the year.\n“This is a really big moment for 16-year-old me and anyone else who has dreamed about being accepted equally for their hard work,” Rosé said in a lengthy and emotional speech.\nSabrina Carpenter won album of the year for Short n’ Sweet and best pop artist, while Grande won best pop video and the evening’s top award, video of year, for Brighter Days Ahead, which she accepted alongside director Christian Breslauer.\n“This project is about the hard work that is healing all different kinds of trauma and coming home to our young selves and creating safety in our own lives, which is a lifelong process and a daily exercise,” Grande said, accepting the award. “If you’re on that journey, please continue onward, because I promise there are brighter days ahead.”\nAs is now typical, the VMAs nodded toward the globalization and genre blends in popular music – Colombian superstar J Balvin and French producer DJ Snake teamed up for their track Noventa; multinational girl group Katseye, with members from the Philippines, South Korea, Switzerland and the US, won for Push performance of the year; and Post Malone and Jelly Roll, beaming in from their tour stop in Munich, represented the ongoing country-ification of pop with their booze-soaked anthem Losers.\nBut the show skewed heavily toward the women in pop, with performances from Doja Cat, Canadian singer Tate McRae and Carpenter, who delivered a retro-themed performance of Tears accompanied by a who’s who of RuPaul’s Drag Race stars and ballroom icons as a statement on protecting trans rights.\nIn recent years, the show once known for delivering culture-defining moments has been more attuned to legacy than its potential to produce new ones, introducing two new lifetime achievement awards.\nInaugural Latin Icon honoree Ricky Martin performed a medley of hits including Livin’ La Vida Loca, Pégate, Maria and The Cup of Life, and attributed his 40-year career to his fans. “This is very simple: this is for you all,” he said. “I am addicted to your applause, that’s why I keep coming back.”\nLL Cool J celebrated fellow hip-hop pioneer Busta Rhymes for the Rock the Bells Visionary Award, calling him a “sonic equivalent of a timebomb”. Busta Rhymes powered through a heavily bleeped medley of his rapid-fire bars alongside guests GloRilla, Spliff Star and Joyner Lucas, before accepting the award – named for a 1985 LL Cool J track – with a brief speech.\n“The next time y’all take 35 years to give me one of these, then I’ll talk as long as I want,” he joked, thanking his family, God, DJ Scratch, and the late Ananda Lewis, a 1990s MTV host who “loved the culture and lifted us up” and died of cancer this year at the age of 52.\nMariah Carey was presented with the Video Vanguard Award by Ariana Grande, becoming the eighth consecutive woman to win the evening’s top lifetime achievement honor.\n“I can’t believe I’m getting my first VMA tonight. I just have one question: what in the Sam Hill were you waiting for?” Carey joked, after performing a medley of her hits.\n“Music videos are my way of life, of bringing music to my own life,” she continued. “Let’s be honest, sometimes they’re just an excuse to bring the drama and do things I wouldn’t do in real life … Music evolves, but fun? That is eternal.”\nThe show also celebrated Ozzy Osbourne, who died in July. English singer Yungblud paid tribute to the “prince of darkness” with a rendition of the Black Sabbath classics Crazy Train and Changes, and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler and Joe Perry joining in for Mama, I’m Coming Home.\nAdditional performers on the night included Sombr, Conan Gray and TikTok star turned musician Alex Warren, who was awarded best new artist before the telecast and sang his improbable hit Ordinary, the longest-running No 1 of the year."

    "raw_text": "If a single individual could be said to embody the attributes of heavy metal, it would be Ozzy Osbourne, who has died aged 76 after suffering from Parkinson’s disease and other disorders. In a career stretching across six decades, Osbourne became a star with Black Sabbath in the 1970s, launched a hugely successful solo career in the 1980s, turned himself into a heavy metal entrepreneur in the 1990s with his travelling Ozzfest rock festival, and in 2002 became an unlikely but wildly successful reality TV star, thanks to the MTV show The Osbournes.\nThe Black Sabbath repertoire included songs with titles such as Paranoid, Evil Woman, Hand of Doom and Children of the Grave. The atmosphere was darkened further by the guitarist Tony Iommi’s fondness for tuning his strings lower than usual, and lyrics (mostly written by the bass player Geezer Butler) that alluded to the occult and mental illness, sung in Osbourne’s urgent high-register whine. His voice was not pretty but it was impossible to ignore as it sliced through Sabbath’s dense sludge of drums, bass and fuzz-toned guitar. “Sabbath never set out to be legendary,” Osbourne said in 2005. “The only thing we set out to do was scare people.”\nSabbath were a hit straight out of the blocks with their debut album, Black Sabbath (1970), which sailed into the UK Top 10 and reached 23 on the US Billboard chart, despite a hostile response from rock critics. Later that year they released the follow-up, Paranoid, which topped the British chart. Its tough and edgy title song gave them their only British Top 10 single (it went to No 4), while Iron Man and the outspokenly political War Pigs became staples of the Sabbath catalogue, each featuring a distinctive Iommi guitar riff.\nThe band’s hot streak continued through the albums Master of Reality (1971), Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) and Sabotage (1975), but Never Say Die! (1978) signalled Osbourne’s departure and the end of Sabbath mark one. Following some chaotic touring and abortive recording sessions, Osbourne was fired in 1979. An alcohol-and-cocaine lifestyle coupled with legal squabbles with their management and record label had sapped the band’s strength. “I was drinking like a fish for two years,” Osbourne said. “I would have been dead in two or three years if I’d carried on.”\nBlack Sabbath were managed by the notably unsentimental music mogul Don Arden, who assigned his daughter, Sharon, to keep Ozzy sufficiently acquainted with the straight and narrow to be able to write songs and perform. She became his manager and, in 1982, his wife. She launched him as a solo artist, leading his own band, The Blizzard of Ozz, which featured the gifted guitarist and songwriter Randy Rhoads. When Warner Bros and EMI turned Osbourne down as a solo artist, Sharon signed him to her father’s label, Jet. Osbourne’s solo career was immediately successful, his debut album, Blizzard of Ozz (1980), producing a couple of hit singles with Crazy Train and Mr Crowley, the latter inspired by the occultist Aleister Crowley.\nThe follow-up, Diary of a Madman (1981), was another bestseller – in his autobiography, I Am Ozzy (2010), Osbourne cited this as his favourite album – and contained the drug-inspired hit single Flying High Again. However, Osbourne’s progress was rarely incident-free, and, marriage aside, 1982 was a particular annus horribilis. In January that year, when he was perfoming in Des Moines, Iowa, an audience member threw what Osbourne took to be a rubber bat onstage, whereupon he bit its head off only to discover that the creature was real flesh and blood. He was forced to seek precautionary treatment for rabies.\nThe following month, he was arrested in San Antonio, Texas, after urinating on the Alamo cenotaph. As a police officer remarked, “Son, when you piss on the Alamo, you piss on the state of Texas.” Osbourne was banned from performing in the city until 1992, when he made a public apology and donated $10,000 to maintaining the monument. In March 1982, Rhoads was killed in Florida while joyriding in a Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft, which crashed.\nThe albums Bark at the Moon (1983), The Ultimate Sin (1986) and No Rest for the Wicked (1988) carried Osbourne through the 1980s on a surging tide of sales, but controversy was never far away. In 1986 he was sued by the parents of Daniel McCollom, who had killed himself while listening to Blizzard of Ozz; the parents contended that the song Suicide Solution was a “proximate cause” of his death. The case was dismissed in 1988, but Osbourne was then sued by the parents of another young man, Michael Waller, who alleged that their son too was driven to kill himself by hidden messages in the song. Again, the suit was dismissed.\nIn 1989 Osbourne was arrested for attempted murder after trying to strangle Sharon while under the influence of drugs and alcohol. This caused him to spend six months in rehab. After he recorded the album No More Tears (1991), he announced that the tour to promote it (he called it No More Tours) would be his last before he retired. The album contained Osbourne’s only Top 40 solo hit single in the US, Mama, I’m Coming Home. The song was addressed to Sharon, from whom he was temporarily estranged.\nRecordings from the tour were released as Live & Loud (1993), which included many of his best-known songs, with the other members of Black Sabbath joining Osbourne for the track Black Sabbath. Live & Loud was intended to bring the curtain down on his career, and the track I Don’t Want To Change The World won him a Grammy for best metal performance in 1994.\nOzzy was born John Osbourne in Aston, Birmingham. His father, Jack, did night shifts at the industrial company GEC, while his mother, Lillian (nee Unitt), worked for the motor components firm Lucas. He had three older sisters, Jean, Iris and Gillian, and two younger brothers, Paul and Tony. The family managed to squeeze into a two-bedroom home with an outside toilet in Lodge Road, Aston.\nHe acquired the nickname “Ozzy” at primary school, after being initially dubbed “Oz-brain”, and while his school work was hampered by dyslexia, he showed interest in music and performing when he took roles in school productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas including The Pirates of Penzance, HMS Pinafore and The Mikado. Soon, the influence of the Beatles loomed large. Ozzy claimed he had originally wanted to be a plumber, then decided he wanted to be a Beatle instead.\nHe left school at 15 and took a variety of jobs, including trainee plumber, slaughterhouse assistant and apprentice toolmaker, and for a time worked at the same Lucas factory as his mother, where he tuned car-horns. An amateurish attempt at petty crime led to him being arrested while trying to steal a television, and he spent six weeks in Winson Green prison.\nAfter a stint as vocalist with an R&B band called the Approach, in 1967 Osbourne was recruited by Butler to sing with his band, Rare Breed. The group imploded almost immediately, whereupon Osbourne and Butler joined Iommi and the drummer Bill Ward to form Earth. In 1969 they changed their name to Black Sabbath, after a 1963 horror film featuring Boris Karloff. With help from the Birmingham club owner Jim Simpson, who acted as their manager, the band secured a deal with Vertigo Records, which released their debut album, recorded and mixed in two days.\nOsbourne’s early 1990s retirement lasted only until 1995, when he came roaring back with a new album, Ozzmosis. Though hardly a classic, this sold three million copies within 12 months, and, after his follow-up Retirement Sucks tour proved one of the biggest successes of the summer, Osbourne and Sharon created the heavy metal touring package that they dubbed Ozzfest. This became an annual event in the US, Europe and eventually Japan.\nOzzfest presented a huge array of metal, thrash and hardcore bands, from Metallica and Judas Priest to Slipknot, Slayer, System of a Down and Linkin Park. In 2004 Ozzy and Sharon presented Battle for Ozzfest on MTV, in which bands competed to be included on the 2005 bill.\nIn 1997 Ozzfest included a Black Sabbath reunion, after which the band recorded the live album Reunion (1998) and continued touring into 1999, appearing again at Ozzfest. A mooted new Black Sabbath studio album was put on hold while Osbourne completed a solo album, Down to Earth (2001).\nIt was now that his career took its surprising lurch into TV. Following an appearance on MTV’s reality show Cribs, about celebrity homes, the Osbourne family were recruited for their own series, The Osbournes, which ran for three years from 2002. Featuring Ozzy and Sharon with their children Jack and Kelly – their elder daughter Aimee hated the idea and opted out – it resembled a surreal, outlandish sitcom liberally spattered with X-rated language, and became one of MTV’s greatest successes. He was back on TV in 2016 with Ozzy & Jack’s World Detour, which ran for three series, with Kelly joining her father and brother for the third in 2018.\nIn 2003 Ozzy almost died after crashing his quad bike at his estate in Buckinghamshire. While he was in hospital he topped the UK singles charts for the first time with Changes, a Black Sabbath song he had re-recorded as a duet with Kelly.\nIn 2005 he was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame as both solo artist and member of Black Sabbath, and the following year into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Black Sabbath. An album of cover versions, Under Cover (2005), was received unenthusiastically, but he was back to chartbusting ways with Black Rain (2007) and Scream (2010). The long-awaited Black Sabbath studio album, 13, finally appeared in 2013. Memoirs of a Madman (2014) was a compilation of the best of Osbourne’s solo work. In 2015 he received the Ivor Novello award for lifetime achievement at a ceremony in London.\nIn 2016, Black Sabbath, including Ozzy, embarked on a year-long world tour, billed as the group’s swansong. However, it was overshadowed by further Osbourne family dramas. In May, news broke that Ozzy had moved out of the family home after 34 years of marriage. It emerged that he had been having a four-year relationship with Michelle Pugh, a hair stylist, and was being treated for sex addiction. Ozzy made a public apology, saying that he was undergoing “intense therapy”.\nIn 2019, he was forced to postpone his No More Tours 2 concerts in Europe after being hospitalised with a respiratory infection. He was also diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, though this was not made public until 2020 (in 2005 he had been diagnosed with Parkin syndrome, a genetic condition which causes symptoms similar to Parkinson’s).\nIn September 2019 he reached No 8 on the US singles charts with his performance on Post Malone’s Take What You Want, his first entry into the Top 10 since 1989. He released a well-received new solo album, Ordinary Man (2020), but cancelled planned north American shows to enable him to undergo treatment for Parkinson’s in Switzerland. In 2022 he released his 13th solo album, Patient Number 9.\nEarlier this month he gave his concert farewell at Villa Park, Birmingham as the finale of a day of metal music. A short set of solo songs was followed by another with his original Black Sabbath bandmates Iommi, Butler and Ward, ending with Paranoid.\nIn 1971 he married Thelma Riley, and they had three children, Jessica, Louis and Elliot. Shortly after their divorce in 1982 he married Sharon. She survives him, along with the three children from each marriage."

    "raw_text": "We’ve never been short of Jane Austen film adaptations. In fact, it seems a new one arrives every decade – two were announced recently, including Netflix’s spin on Pride & Prejudice. Yet, one adaptation has been shamefully overlooked: Gurinder Chadha’s Bride & Prejudice.\nA cross-cultural, British-and-Bollywood-meets-Hollywood take on Austen’s most famous novel, the film is pure joy – a riot of original musical numbers, colourful costumes, chaos, culture clashes and, of course, romance.\nYou may think it wouldn’t work, but it does. Released after the huge success of Bend It Like Beckham, Chadha spent two years filming Bride & Prejudice across three continents. It’s a homage to the Bollywood films she grew up watching with a modern, western twist – a cinematic expression of her hybrid identity.\nThe comfort lies in the beloved storyline, effortlessly familiar. Themes of class, social expectations and (yes) prejudices are refracted through Bollywood tropes and melodrama. We leap from Amritsar to Goa, then LA and London. More than that, Austen’s world fits surprisingly well into contemporary India, where arranged marriages equal security and status. These parallels make the novel an ideal fit for a 21st-century Indian retelling.\nThe Bennets become the Bakshis – a middle-class family from Amritsar with four daughters to marry off. Our heroine is Lalita, played by the former Miss World and Bollywood movie icon Aishwarya Rai. Like Elizabeth Bennet, she is clever, full of gumption and occasionally arrogant. Reviews were mixed, but unanimous about Rai’s beauty. Branded as a “stately beauty” (the Guardian) and reduced to a “world-class hottie” (Rolling Stone), she proved to be both dazzling on screen and deft enough to bridge Bollywood spectacle and British sensibility.\nAt a wedding party, we meet our Mr Darcy – reimagined as Will Darcy (Martin Henderson), an American real-estate tycoon. He arrives with best friend Balraj (Naveen Andrews) and Balraj’s sister Kiran (Indira Varma). So begins the east-meets-west culture clash. “Watch out, Darcy, he’s about to turn into the Indian MC Hammer,” quips Kiran, as the film’s best dance number kicks off. During this exuberant sequence, Lalita shines and Darcy falls for her but his comments at their initial meeting reek of western superiority, and Lalita, quick to judge, writes him off.\nBalraj invites Lalita and her older sister, Jaya (Namrata Shirodkar) to Goa, where Darcy is viewing a potential hotel purchase. Lalita’s impassioned rebuttal of his motives: “You think this is India? Five-star comfort with a bit of culture thrown in? Well, I don’t want you to turn India into a theme park” – feels just as relevant today.\nChadha adds intersectionality to Austen’s tale. Class here is inseparable from culture and colonialism. India’s recent independence looms in the background and western misreading of Indian identity and values are woven into the story.\nIn Goa, we encounter George Wickham (Daniel Gillies), shirtless and smouldering, intriguing Lalita while undermining Darcy’s reputation. Fun fact: it’s common to include an “item number” in Bollywood films, where a glamorous performer takes centre stage for a showpiece song that rarely aids the storyline. Keeping this tradition, American singer Ashanti delivers a sultry Bollywood-R&B fusion performance.\nFrom here, the plot broadly follows Austen’s. Along the way, we meet Mr Kohli (Nitin Ganatra) AKA Mr Collins, or as Mrs Bakshi states, “your father’s sister’s husband’s sister’s son”. He’s an exaggerated portrait of a first-generation Indian-American, enamoured with the west yet fixated on marriage. Lalita inevitably sees Darcy’s better qualities. Their romance is told through a Bollywood-inspired montage – in a full-throttle song that transcends into gospel, ending with a choir singing on Venice Beach.\nBeing faithful to the novel’s idiosyncrasies is beside the point in this adaptation – don’t watch if you’re a stickler for accuracy, or if you don’t like characters seamlessly breaking into song. The film may lack nuanced depths, but it brims with joy. Austen’s novels are often restrained on the surface but bubbling with emotion underneath. In Bride & Prejudice, those emotions burst forth in larger-than-life numbers by Bollywood royalty Anu Malik.\nPrimarily funded by the UK Film Council, this was a truly cross-cultural production – shot across LA, London and India with the three countries’ cast and crew creating something new together. Could a film like this be made today? I’m not so sure.\nWhat I am sure of is Bride & Prejudice honours Bollywood. The people are beautiful, the energy is infectious and any film that brings a cultural shake-up to a classic, predominantly white narrative should be welcomed. Maybe that’s the biggest message of all: finding commonality despite culture differences is infinitely more interesting. If that’s not feelgood, I don’t know what is.\n-\nBride and Prejudice is available to rent digitally in the US, UK and Australia\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Sixteen is a great age to see a movie, there on a threshold between wide-eyed wonder and something like maturity. That’s how old I was when I first laid eyes on The Talented Mr Ripley, Anthony Minghella’s ravishing, exquisitely grim 1999 adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s flinty 1955 novel. I’d been a movie fan for years at that point, but something about its elegant menace, its beauty flecked with blood, grabbed ahold of me like little had previously. It is by no means a feelgood film, this story of queer longing and loneliness giving way to murderous deed. But watching it now (as I do perhaps embarrassingly often) still evokes the primal thrill of art cracking open a young mind.\nMinghella, who died in 2008, was a master of style, crafting wholly credible visions of the past. His prowess is perhaps best on display in Ripley, which takes the viewer on a grand tour of mid-20th-century Italy, both its sun-splashed coastal languor and its more anxious, cobble-gray city streets. Tom Ripley, a low-birth conman sent to Europe’s blessed boot to retrieve a prodigal shipping scion at his father’s behest, is in awe of the country, as are we in the audience; so much so that we begin to sickly root for Tom’s increasingly sinister campaign to stay there.\nGabriel Yared’s alternately forbidding and playful score – its seductive clarinet, its ominously plinking glockenspiel – envelops as Tom plunges ever further into his pool of lies, dragging hapless heirs and dilettantes down into the murk with him. It’s seriously high-grade suspense, though the film thrums with a sadder, more profound undertone. Just beneath the film’s lacquered finish is a bitter, and disarmingly empathetic, consideration of what it is to live with unspoken desire, to yearn and reach for a golden world from which your true self would likely be shunned.\nIt’s no mystery why I, having just come out of the closet in the summer of 1999, saw in this film something particularly salient. But it wasn’t just that. It was the electric rush of Minghella’s seamless execution, working with a cast of soon-to-be-enormous actors – who, I’d argue, have never been better.\nFew other young, straight male actors trying to make their name in 1990s Hollywood would have been confident enough to play this shifty queer protagonist with anything matching Matt Damon’s precise, fearless conviction.\nJude Law, a sun-god beamed into the picture from Mount Olympus, is a perfectly loathsome and alluring Dickie Greenleaf. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a noxious hoot as boorish flaneur Freddie Miles. Gwyneth Paltrow is effectively patrician and pathetic as Dickie’s fiancee Marge, whose worldly chicness and easy warmth are no match for Tom’s cruel manipulations. And, of course, there is the magnificent Cate Blanchett, gliding off with each of her scenes as Meredith Logue, a socially stunted textiles princess who witlessly aids Tom in his deceptions, happy to be involved in a bit of intrigue while being rather careless with her own heart.\nIt was all so exciting to witness at 16, when I was beginning to form an idea of what I liked about actors, about movies. And, maybe, when Hollywood was developing a new idea of itself. The Talented Mr Ripley might ultimately have fallen on the wrong side of that cultural faultline; it is the kind of Hollywood film that is now in woefully short supply, entertaining and artful and, despite all the period trappings and on-location shooting, modestly budgeted. Such things have largely gone away in the years since Ripley’s release. But at the time, the film felt – for me, anyway – like a bridge to the future.\nIf the movie is a relic of a lost age, what a relic it is. And how significantly it has resounded in my head, returning to me again and again as I’ve ventured into adulthood. On any of my many rewatches, I’m certainly not seeking solace from Tom Ripley; I’m not even craving a trip to Italy. (Any more than usual, anyway.) What I am instead chasing, and remembering, is the giddiness of realizing that movies like Ripley could even exist, and that I was finally ready to see and enjoy them.\nWhich is why The Talented Mr Ripley has become, in its shivery and melancholic way, a feelgood movie for me, and no doubt plenty of others. It’s a representation of Hollywood’s purest capability, to enthral and stir and transport. However naively, I still hold the hope that an upstart director of this era might turn to Minghella’s film, now a quarter-century old, and find some inspiration in it. There in its thoughtful construction, its deft employment of movie-star glow, its calm insistence that literary things can also be visceral, sensual wonders. If we can’t all go to Europe to find ourselves, we can at least watch Ripley and let ourselves darkly dream.\n-\nThe Talented Mr Ripley is available in the US on Paramount+ and the Criterion Channel, on Amazon Prime and Paramount+ in the UK and on Stan in Australia\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Eggs in a basket are a treat. The easiest way to make the necessary holes in your sliced bread is with a round pastry cutter – or a heart-shaped one for fun. Break the eggs into their bread ‘baskets’, then fry up their “hats” to go alongside. To make this a grownup rather than a nursery dinner, serve with lemon-and-paprika-spiked chard, or spinach or kale, if that’s what you have; I am growing a surfeit of chard, so I always need new ways to use it up.\nEggs in a basket with smoky chard\nPrep 10 min\nCook 10 min\nServes 2 (but scale up if you’re hungry)\n2 tbsp olive oil\n1 garlic clove, peeled and finely sliced\n150g rainbow chard, roughly chopped\n1 tsp hot smoked paprika\n1 tsp flaky sea salt\nJuice of ½ lemon\n2 large slices good white bread or sourdough\n2 medium eggs\n50g Greek yoghurt, to serve\nPut a tablespoon of the oil in a large frying pan on a medium heat, add the garlicand fry for 30 seconds. Add the chard and paprika, and stir-fry for three to four minutes, just until the chard has wilted (this will take less time if it’s quite young). Season with a half-teaspoon of flaky sea salt and the lemon juice, then taste and add more salt as needed. Transfer the chard to a bowl and wipe out the pan with kitchen roll.\nWhile the chard is cooking, use a round cutter to stamp out a circle from the centre of each slice of bread. Put the remaining oil in the now-empty chard pan on a medium heat, then lay in the bread (one slice at a time, if the pan’s not big enough for both) and its cut-out circle, too, if there’s room and fry for a minute just to get a little colour. Flip over, break an egg into the hole in the centre and fry for a minute or two, until the white is just set and the yolk runny; if you prefer your eggs over easy, by all means flip for 30 seconds to seal the other side.\nScatter each basket with a pinch of sea salt and serve with the smoky chard, fried bread circles and a big spoon of yoghurt alongside.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "There are a handful of moments on the culinary calendar that feel like striking gold: rhubarb in January, peas and broad beans in spring, summer cherries and tomatoes, and, for just a few short weeks in late-summer, figs. Typically, they might be torn over yoghurt and granola for breakfast or baked into a tart with frangipane, but they belong in the savoury kitchen, too. Combined with salt, savoury ingredients and a little vinegar, a good fig will bring a gorgeous sweet-sour note to your dinner table.\nPolenta with sweet-and-sour figs and pecorino\nAs the warmer months come to an end, I like to cook with both comfort and freshness in mind. Rich, buttery, warming polenta is offset with a vibrant, bright, jammy topping of onions, rosemary and torn figs. Shave over some pecorino for a funky, savoury twang, and you’ve got a dish that’ll scratch that late-summer itch.\nPrep 15 min\nCook 45 min\nServes 4\nFor the polenta\n250ml whole milk\n150g coarse cornmeal\n30g butter\nFor the sweet-and-sour figs\nOlive oil\n2 red onions, peeled and thinly sliced\n10g rosemary (2-3 sprigs), leaves stripped and finely chopped\nSea salt and black pepper\n20g brown sugar\n20ml aged balsamic vinegar\n6-8 ripe figs\nPecorino romano, to serve\nPut 600ml water and the milk in a pan, then whisk in the cornmeal. Set the pan over a medium heat and bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Turn down the heat to low and let it tick over, stirring every now and then – if things start to get a bit too thick, add a splash of water to loosen. You don’t need to stand there whisking away the entire time; just check in on the polenta every five to 10 minutes, and give it a good stir.\nMeanwhile, set a frying pan on a medium heat and add a shot of olive oil. Add the onions, half the rosemary and a pinch of salt, then toss in the warm oil and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until the onions are starting to caramelise. Add the sugar and vinegar, and continue cooking until the onions are jammy. Tear the figs in half, drop them into the pan, stir to coat, and finish with the remaining rosemary.\nOnce the polenta has had 45 minutes or so in the pan, whisk in the butter. This is the moment to adjust the texture; I like my polenta gently to relax into the bowl. If it’s too thick, add a little water or milk; if it’s too thin, keep cooking. Spoon the polenta into warm bowls and top with the jammy onions. Use a mandoline or cheese grater to shave some pecorino over the top and serve.\nRoast chicken legs with beans and figs\nA chicken leg is, for my money, the ultimate midweek ingredient. With very little effort, it really sings and can be cooked with little hands-on time. This traybake uses slightly under-ripe figs, orange, fennel seeds and capers to create a chicken and bean dish that’ll fly into your weekly rotation. When out of season, swap the figs for dried fruit such as apricots, dates or prunes.\nPrep 10 min\nCook 1 hr 15 min\nServes 4\n4 skin-on, bone-in chicken legs\nFine sea salt\n3 onions, peeled and cut into wedges\n4 tbsp capers\n5 garlic cloves, peeled, gently squashed with a knife, but left whole\nPeeled zest of 1 orange\n1 tbsp fennel seeds\nOlive oil\n700g jar cooked white beans, not drained\n6-8 slightly underripe figs\n2-3 tbsp sherry vinegar\n15g fresh oregano\nExtra-virgin olive oil\nHeat the oven to 245C (225C fan)/480F/gas 9½, and season the chicken legs with salt. Put the onion wedges, capers, garlic, orange zest and fennel seeds in a roasting tin that’s just big enough to hold the chicken legs in a single layer, then drizzle generously with olive oil, season with salt and give everything a good mix. Sit the chicken legs on top, slide into the oven for 25 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 and roast for another 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is very tender.\nTake the tin out of the oven and lift out the chicken legs, leaving all the cooking juices behind. Add the beans and their liquid to the tray, then cut the figs into 1cm slices and toss them in, too. Sit the chicken back on top and return to the oven for 10-15 minutes, until the juices have reduced and thickened.\nTake out of the the oven, set aside the chicken and finish off the beans with the orange juice and a splash of sherry vinegar. Scatter fresh oregano over the top and mingle with the beans. Divide the beans and figs between four plates and top with a roast chicken leg. Drizzle with extra-virgin olive oil and serve.\n-\nHow I Cook: A Chef’s Guide to Really Good Home Cooking, by Ben Lippett, is published by HarperCollins at £26.

    "raw_text": "Canadians are famously nice – think laid-back Keanu Reeves, sunny Pamela Anderson, the charmingly incompetent Inspector Gadget – except when it comes to their beloved nanaimo bars. Get the ratio of this three-tier national treasure wrong, as the New York Times stood accused of doing in 2021, when its Instagram account posted a picture of squares that one user described as “an insult to Canadians everywhere”, and you’ll discover you can push them only so far.\nThe Times is not alone in attracting ire. So popular are nanaimo (pronounced nuh-NYE-mo) bars, named after the British Columbian town where they are said to have originated, that Canada Post put them on a stamp in 2019 … only to face similar howls of outrage, albeit in Canadian: “One hesitates to be critical,” Nanaimo’s mayor explained carefully, “but it’s not a very accurate depiction.”\nIn short, Canadians, who in 2006 voted the nanaimo bar the “nation’s favourite confection”, feel very strongly about these sugary little treats, a mainstay of kids’ birthday parties, wedding buffets and funeral teas from Nanaimo to Nova Scotia, though if Justin Trudeau had any problem with the version served up by White House chefs during his state dinner with Barack Obama in 2016, he was too polite to say so. Please don’t hold back in the comments below – I’m British, I can take it.\nThe base\nBefore I tasted a nanaimo bar, I had assumed that the base, whose principal ingredients are biscuit and desiccated coconut, was the kind of crunchy affair usually found on the bottom of cheesecakes. I was wrong. With the exception of the Canadian Living recipe, which sticks it in the oven for 10 minutes to dry it out, the nanaimo relies on the coagulating power of refrigeration, rather than on heat.\nRevelation two: instead of the large lumps of biscuit suspended in chocolate that one might expect in a British fridge cake, this base is made from fine crumbs soaked in sweet, cocoa-flavoured butter, giving it a soft, almost squidgy texture. Once I’ve come to terms with this fact (I do love a crunchy base), I need to decide the best replacement for the graham cracker crumbs demanded by Canadian recipes. Graham (pronounced “gram”) crackers, are a peculiarly North American phenomenon named after what the Encyclopedia Britannica describes as the “eccentric … clergyman and health reformer” Sylvester Graham, who travelled around early 19th-century New England warning against the dangers of lust, as incited by, among other things, refined sugars and grains. His unsweetened, fatless crackers were made from coarsely ground wholemeal wheat flour. Modern equivalents, Britannica explains, “would likely be unrecognisable to Graham, as they are typically made with refined white flour, sugar and trans fats, and are flavoured with honey or cinnamon; chocolate varieties are also common”.\nThey are also £18 a box online, excluding delivery, which means they will not feature in my recipe, though I do buy a bag of graham cracker crumbs to try to work out the nearest equivalent. To my surprise, they’re a fine, if slightly gritty powder, rather than a crumb, with a flavour somewhere between a British digestive and a rich tea biscuit. The original texture feels somewhat irrelevant, so, having given rich tea, digestives and Hobnobs (a suggestion from the Cupcake Jemma team here in the UK) a try, I conclude that you should go with whichever takes your fancy. Personally, I enjoy the more restrained sweetness of a rich tea, but you might yearn for the oaty nubbliness of a Hobnob or the more malty flavour of a digestive. That said, I’ve deliberately left in a few larger chunks to give the base a more interesting texture, which may be offensive to nanaimo purists – in which case, keep whizzing.\n(I do try baking my own graham crackers using a recipe from Deb at Smitten Kitchen, which, for some reason, possibly relating to metric conversions, end up sticky, chewy and hard to grind – they taste good, but as far as I’m concerned they add an unnecessary layer of complexity to proceedings; the nanaimo bar was designed to use processed ingredients, and I’m happy to let that spirit live on in mine.)\nThe biscuits are bulked out by that typically British Columbian ingredient, coconut – the Zingerman’s Bakehouse Celebrate Every Day book calls for fresh, chef Susan Mendelson, whose recipe Margaret Atwood included in her 1987 Canlit Foodbook, unsweetened shredded stuff, and Serious Eats and Canadian Living magazine advise the more moist, sweetened kind. The last is not readily available in the UK, but nigella.com says you can readily substitute it by stirring sugar and hot water into the desiccated stuff. Fresh coconut leaves the biscuit layer too wet, and almost like trifle, while the sweetened sort only adds to the sugar content, so straightforward desiccated feels the best and easiest choice.\nNuts also feature. Atwood, the New York Times confides, favours walnuts, but Joyce Hardcastle, whose recipe won a nanaimo contest to nail down an official version back in 1986, specifies finely chopped almonds, while Mendelson offers a choice of “finely chopped walnuts, almonds or pecans (or a mixture)”. Like the great novelist, I have a strong preference for the bitterness of walnuts, which echo and enhance those in the cocoa, making for a pleasingly rich, almost fruity contrast with the sweetness of the other layers. Toast them, as Zingerman’s suggests, to really bring out their flavour and, while you’re at it, why not do the same with the coconut?\nOn binding and thickness\nThe crumbs, coconut and nuts are suspended in a kind of ganache made from melted butter stirred over heat with sugar and egg, and flavoured with cocoa powder. The most popular base is Mendelson’s from the New York Times, which contains the lowest ratio of butter and sugar to nuts and crumbs, though I will be increasing the cocoa content slightly to ramp up those bitter notes. I don’t see any benefit in baking it, though; that just makes it crumbly and hard to cut.\nAt the risk of provoking Canadian ire – I’m desperate to come and visit, so this is a risky business – the base absolutely should be thicker than the custard or chocolate, because these are, in truth, mere icings, gilding the lily with sweetness and fat. Too much of a good thing is still too much, unless you spend all day working outside in sub-zero temperatures. Then you get a pass.\nThe custard\nSpoiler alert: this isn’t actually custard, it’s custard-flavoured buttercream – and, in my opinion, and the considered opinion of my testers, the main cause of the common complaint that nanaimo bars are, as the New York Times put it delicately, “tremendously sweet” (this from the country that invented marshmallow fluff). That’s because most of the recipes I try cram icing (powdered) sugar into butter at a ratio of 8:1 – for context, Mary Berry’s buttercream uses two parts icing sugar to one part butter. Only Hardcastle and the Serious Eats version, by Canadian writer and former bakery owner Molly Allen, suggest a more restrained 4:1, though I’ve reduced the sugar content even further to suit my own taste. If you feel it’s lacking, feel free to adjust it as you go. Bonus: a lower sugar content makes for a lighter consistency, particularly if, as in those same two recipes, you loosen it with milk rather than double cream.\nNote that almost every recipe I try, with the exception of Canadian Living, specifies unsalted butter, with Hardcastle going as far as to call for “European-style cultured” butter, which has been allowed to ferment before churning, giving it a slightly tangier, more complex flavour. This, I have no hesitation in telling you, is a complete waste of money, because no one is able to detect anything about the butter once it’s been drowned in sugar. Only Allen recommends including some salt to balance all the sweetness – personally, I’d just use salted butter to begin with anyway, not least because that’s what I keep on hand, but, however you include it, salt is a must.\nThe unusual part about the nanaimo bar is the use of custard powder as a flavouring; traditionally, our very own Bird’s, which suits me just fine. American recipes often propose “vanilla pudding mix” as a substitute, but for once I have just the thing on the shelf already. As a cornflour custard devotee, I’d recommend dissolving it, along with some sugar, in milk before whipping it in, to avoid that slightly powdery finish common to all those I try.\nAllen and Canadian Living are also unusual in using vanilla extract to ramp up the custard powder’s “flavouring”. For me, one of the charms of Bird’s custard is this nostalgic artificial vanilla flavour, but if you avoid ultra-processed foods, then by all means use cornflour and genuine vanilla extract instead, but otherwise I see no reason to spoil things with the real, highly perfumed deal.\nThe chocolate\nChocolate is chocolate – for me, 70% cocoa and butter makes a fine topping. You could experiment with adding flavourings such as orange zest or the New York Times’ sea salt, though I don’t think the combination of nutmeg and custard can be improved upon.\nThe construction and slicing\nThe single most important thing I learn in this whole process is patience. Chill each layer thoroughly before adding the next, and everything will be much easier, a detail tactfully omitted from many of the recipes I try. (If you’re Canadian, no doubt you just know.) The crumb layer needs to be solid enough for the buttercream to spread easily on top, and the buttercream should be firm enough to take the warm chocolate afterwards without melting into it. Oh, and line that tin, unless you want to end up with scratches.\nAs Allen notes, nanaimo bars are best served cold from the fridge, rather than at room temperature, whatever some recipes claim. “You can also let them come to room temperature for several minutes, if you prefer, you’ll just have to be prepared for very soft chocolate and custard layers,” she allows, though perhaps my fridge is Canadian room temperature. Who knows?\nPerfect nanaimo bars\nPrep 40 min\nChill 2 hr+\nMakes About 16\nFor the base\n75g shelled walnuts, or nuts of your choice\n75g desiccated coconut\n225g plain biscuits – I use rich tea\n100g butter, cubed – I use salted\n50g sugar\n30g cocoa powder\nA pinch of salt\n1 egg, beaten\nFor the custard layer\n80g soft room-temperature butter – I use salted\n160g icing sugar, sifted\n3 tbsp custard powder\n2 tbsp milk\nA pinch of salt\nFor the topping\n120g 70% cocoa chocolate\n2 tbsp butter\nFreshly grated nutmeg, to taste (optional)\nHeat the walnuts in a dry pan over a medium flame, shaking occasionally, until you can smell them toasting. Tip out and leave to cool slightly. In the same pan, toast the coconut until it’s apricot-coloured, then tip out likewise. Use a food processor (or the end of rolling pin and a plastic bag) to smash the biscuits into uneven crumbs; a few larger chunks are fine. Roughly grind the nuts in a food processor or mortar, again leaving several large chunks and being careful not to overprocess and turn them into butter.\nPut the butter and sugar in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally, until the butter melts. Meanwhile, put the biscuit crumbs, nuts and coconut in a large bowl, and line a roughly 20cm x 20cm baking tin with baking paper (scrunch it up first to help ease it into the corners and sides).\nStir the cocoa and a pinch of salt into the butter and sugar bowl, then add the egg and stir until the mix thickens slightly (you may need to whisk it). Off the heat, combine with the biscuit, nut and coconut mixture and, once that’s all coated, tip it into the lined tin and pat down firmly into an even, flat layer. Cover and freeze for 10 minutes (or chill for 30), until firm.\nMeanwhile, put the butter for the custard layer in a large bowl or stand mixer and beat until soft. Sift over the icing sugar, then beat in until the mixture is really soft and airy. In a small bowl, stir the custard powder and milk until the powder dissolves, then beat this, and a pinch of salt, if necessary, into the custard mixture. Using a spatula or similar, spread this on top of the now chilled and firm biscuit base, taking care not to get too many crumbs into the custard, then cover and chill again for at least an hour, until really firm.\nMelt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, and grate in the nutmeg, if using. Take off the heat, leave to cool slightly, then tip on top of the butter layer and tilt the tin so the chocolate spreads evenly. Bang the tin against a counter to settle the chocolate layer, then cover and return to the fridge. After about 20 minutes, once the chocolate has begun to set, but is still tacky, score into bars or squares, then return to the fridge to set solid.\nTo cut, lift out of the tin (use the paper lining to help you), then slice – to make life easier, use a knife dipped into hot water and quickly wiped dry. Covered, the nanaimo bars will keep well in the fridge for up to five days, and can also be wrapped and frozen.\n-\nNanaimo bars: Canadian icon, or a poor third to poutine and butter pies?

    "raw_text": "Solly’s Corner, a fast food restaurant in downtown Johannesburg, was bustling. Slabs of hake and golden chips sizzled, green chillies were being chopped and homemade sauces distributed liberally into packed sandwiches.\nFood influencer and radio DJ Nick Hamman stepped behind the counter and was greeted as an old friend by Yoonas and Mohammed Akhalwaya, the father-son duo behind the family business in Fordsburg, a historical south Asian and Middle Eastern area.\nHamman, who has more than 200,000 followers on both Instagram and TikTok, has made it his mission for the past two years to boost food businesses across South Africa, highlighting the country’s diverse cuisine and bringing South Africans together across their often divided cultures.\nEach video opens with a cheerful: “I’m Nick Hamman!” He then goes on to state his goal for the day, such as looking for the best burgers, boerewors sausages or breyani (biriyani). From mala mogodu intestine stew to magwinya doughnuts slathered with liver, there is seemingly nothing that Hamman won’t wholeheartedly enjoy.\n“I started seeing food as a common theme in binding all of what I was interested in: culture, family, history, heritage,” said the 34-year-old, who also hosts the breakfast show on the radio station 5FM. “I believe food is political. I think food is very deeply tied to memory and nostalgia and history. And it tells the story of our country in a very special way.\n“It’s a democracy in one way, so we get a lot of suggestions on social media … If you start to see a place being suggested 100 times or more, you get a good sense that you should probably go there.”\nThe entrepreneurs tick certain boxes: passionate about their food and culture, often with stories of overcoming adversity. Solly’s Corner also epitomises a type of business Hamman is fond of covering: a legendary spot that nevertheless remains something of a hidden gem.\nFounded in 1956 by Yoonas’s mother, Khadija, the restaurant survived eviction in 1968 by the apartheid government’s Group Areas Act, which forced people to live in racially designated areas. It also made it through the Covid-19 pandemic and an electrical fire in 2021 that gutted the shop. “We’ve had our ups and downs, but we thank God above,” said Yoonas. “It’s an absolute blessing feeding people,” Mohammed added.\nHamman’s videos about Solly’s Corner have been viewed more than 1.7m times on TikTok, Instagram and Facebook since October 2023. The Akhalwayas were so appreciative of the extra 50-60% business that Hamman brought in, they plastered a huge image of him on a wall and named a burger after him. “Nick, also, he’s from the man upstairs,” Mohammed said warmly.\nAbout 12 miles (19km) north, the township of Alexandra, often called just Alex, sits on steep slopes either side of a river. The towers of Sandton, known as “Africa’s richest square mile”, loom on the horizon. In a more affluent part of the township there is another type of entrepreneur that Hamman is drawn to: the young chef trying to uplift their area.\nGift Sedibeng founded Siga Culinary restaurant in 2018 in his parents’ old house, after a year working in a Mexican restaurant in Texas. The 33-year-old wanted to broaden his township’s tastebuds with fusion food, such as a towering “MexiKasi” kota burrito. An adaptation of the classic kota street food, a hollowed-out quarter white loaf is filled with everything from chips to chopped steak, a cheese burger and fried egg, plus Mexican twists including homemade pineapple salsa.\n“I like it when you make a meal for a person and they express their love … It makes my heart melt,” Sedibeng said.\nSedibeng, who plans to open a culinary school next year, said about 60% of his customers come from outside Alex, then tell their friends that it is safe. “Crime is still there, but it’s not as bad as before,” he said.\nHamman hopes his videos can help to boost the local economy: “Places like Alex, for example, where there is brilliance … if we don’t present these spaces in ways that people are going to be enticed to come into them, the money’s never going to come into these areas and they aren’t going to be given a fair chance to develop.”\nOne of the worst-reputed places in Alex is Madala hostel, one of many built in townships by the apartheid government as men-only housing to control thousands of black male migrant workers. They became synonymous with the deadly political violence of the early 1990s, xenophobic killings in 2008 and continuing crime.\nHamman wanted to show that hostels are also host to a vibrant food culture. Where goats graze next to open sewers and rats scurry among rubbish, the rich smoke of barbecued meat can be found filling a walkway leading into Madala’s main courtyard.\nA man who only gave his nickname, Mugabe, cooked shisanyama – a traditional Zulu braai: tender slices of beef steak, liver, heart and sausage, eaten with carrot and bean chakalaka salad, hot sauce and salt. On the hostel’s top floor, Mthunzi Ngema has been stewing inyama yenhloko, tender cow’s head meat, in dazzlingly clean silver vats since 1996.\nWhile Mugabe and Ngema busied themselves with customers, Wandile “Wax” Dhlamini, an Alex local who acts as a guide to Madala, effused about the food. “In Zulu ceremonies we slaughter the cow and have the meat to feast, all the different parts,” he said. “More than anything, it’s a culture.”"

    "raw_text": "An effortlessly cool Nick Kamen strolls into a launderette, strips to his boxer shorts and washes his jeans in front of a stunned clientele, soundtracked by Marvin Gaye’s I Heard It Through the Grapevine. The 1985 Levi’s 501 advert made a star of its model, and presented an image in keeping with the clothing brand’s all-American style.\nBut could that deep-seated association with the US prove an achilles heel? Last week, in its UK accounts, Levi’s issued a warning that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could affect its sales in Britain. The idea is not unique – attitudes towards Tesla in the UK and Europe deteriorated when Elon Musk was closely associated with Trump. However, the Levi’s warning raises the question – could fashion become the latest sector affected by anti-American sentiment outside the US?\nRetail and brand experts are divided. Achim Berg, the founder of the Germany-based fashion and luxury thinktank FashionSights, was surprised by the Levi’s warning – he sees the company as a different case from something such as Tesla or Amazon, which are “directly associated with the US [government]”. This is in contrast to other companies. “I haven’t seen any reports about people holding back on Apple, holding back on Netflix. If you think about it, we are all using plenty of US products and services every day.”\nHowever, Catherine Shuttleworth, a retail consultant and the chief executive of Savvy Marketing, does think there is a risk. “People are thinking twice about going on holiday to America and about buying some of those products,” she says. “If I was [a retailer of an] all-American product, I would be thinking about how I presented myself differently in terms of my advertising and marketing.”\nAny sign of an anti-Americanism trend would cause a headache for an industry benefiting from the popularity of Americana and preppy looks.\nLabels such as Hollister, Ralph Lauren and Brandy Melville are popular – the last opened a new store in London in June.\nHollister’s parent company, Abercrombie & Fitch, posted a 12% rise in profit in its Europe, the Middle East and Africa division in 2024 and searches for Polo Ralph Lauren increased 27% on the resale app Depop between July and August.\nAlex Goat, the chief executive of the youth-focused creative agency Livity, says this look plugs into an idealised version of the US that is served in popular TV shows such as The Summer I Turned Pretty and My Life with the Walter Boys. “They are not reflecting the political issues that are going on in the States at the moment. They’re the same halcyon American days that we all probably thought about when we were growing up,” she says. “If that’s what you think America is, then where’s the challenge to buy from brands like that?”\nEmma Davidson, the fashion features director of Dazed Digital, agrees this look is not a direct correlation with an all-American patriotism. “We call it preppy and varsity style but it feels one step removed from what it once stood for,” she says.\nExperts do, however, agree that overt patriotism is unlikely to export well. “If you were Levi’s you wouldn’t be what you’ve been leaning into [stars and stripes],” Shuttleworth says. “You might use influencers that are not as American perhaps.”\nDavidson points to a cultural example. “It surprised me that Beyoncé was plastered in stars and stripes throughout the Cowboy Carter tour,” she says. “It felt really out of step with what’s going on in the world.”\nWhile these are global brands, appealing to US customers is an integral part of their business. “The domestic markets for some of these brands absolutely blow their international sales out of the water,” Shuttleworth says. “They will have to think strategically about who they appeal to in the short term.” With tariffs in place on imports, there is also an opportunity here – with consumers potentially shifting, as Trump hopes, to “buying American”.\nPatriotic and conservative marketing can play out well with consumers who voted for Trump, as has been proven with American Eagle’s US campaign with the blond, blue-eyed Sydney Sweeney opining that she has “great genes”. With an outcry on social media, one TikTok user described it as “dog whistle to the rise of conservatism in this country”. True to form, Trump praised Sweeney on social media.\nRather than this having a negative impact on the brand, American Eagle’s share price increased 25% last week in the aftermath of an upbeat quarterly update – with sales decreasing only 1% compared with 5% in the previous quarter. Its chief executive, Jay Schottenstein, credited the Sweeney ad, arguing it helped “an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales”.\nIn Canada, hostility towards US products is growing – with reports of shoppers turning American goods upside down on supermarket shelves so they can be avoided by fellow shoppers, and a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s, a brand that has Americana central to its marketing.\nCould a similar boycott happen with fashion brands in the UK? Shuttleworth is sceptical. “What cost are our principles?” she says. “We say one thing but we do another. I don’t like Donald Trump very much but if Bobbi Brown launches a new range of makeup tomorrow, don’t think I won’t buy it because it’s American. I’ll self-justify.”\nBerg argues that consumer awareness around brands is less than the media suggests. “In my experience, customer reaction is typically not as direct and not as consequential and consistent as people tend to think,” he says. “You could see that during the ‘wokeness’ wave, during the sustainability wave. Despite a certain reputation, consumers were still in love with certain brands that were not famous for being very woke or being very sustainable.”\nGoat says this is particularly true with young people. “It’s like ‘the world is burning, and I want to act on that but I still want to be able to buy clothes that are affordable.’” (She is quick to point out this is not the first generation of young people with such a paradox – “younger people are always more politically involved and still also want to look good and feel good and do that on a budget,” she says.)\nWhile Goat does not totally rule out a distancing from American brands, she suggests that young people in the UK are more likely to boycott those with links to Israel because of its government’s actions in Gaza. “It’s a humanitarian crisis versus a very difficult political situation.”\nIf a significant boycott of US brands does materialise, Shuttleworth believes it would spread online. “It’s like: ‘How can we hurt Trump? Probably only in the economy,’” she says. “If enough people get behind it, it becomes a thing; social media can grow really quickly.”"

    "raw_text": "Nick Kamen, who sprang to fame as a Levi’s model and later became a singer-songwriter, has died at the age of 59, a friend of his family has confirmed.\nKamen died on Tuesday night after a long illness, it is understood.\nHis friend and fellow musician Boy George paid tribute to Kamen on Wednesday, describing him as “the most beautiful and sweetest man”.\nJohn Taylor, the bassist of Duran Duran, wrote on Twitter: “So so sad to hear of the passing of Nick Kamen. One of the loveliest and gentlest men I ever met. He was a beloved friend to my daughter and her Mom. We shall all miss him. RIP Nick.”\nThe actor Susie Cave shared a photo of Kamen on Instagram and wrote: “RIP Nick Kamen my sweet friend.”\nKamen appeared on the front of The Face magazine in 1984 wearing a ski hat, lipstick and aviator sunglasses. The following year he starred in an advert for Levi’s in which he stripped to his boxer shorts in an old-fashioned launderette to wash his jeans while a group of female customers looked on spellbound as Marvin Gaye’s 1968 hit Heard It Through The Grapevine played in the background.\nBritish pop/folk singer-songwriter Tanita Tikaram said she had met the musician when they were signed to the same label. “He was kind & sweet, none of the ego of someone who had just set the world alight with his extraordinary beauty. My condolences to his family,” she wrote on Twitter.\nKamen, who was born in Harlow, Essex, launched his career in pop music in 1986. His biggest hit, Each Time You Break My Heart, a collaboration with Madonna, reached number five in the charts. His eponymous debut album also featured Kamen’s second single, Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever, a cover of the Four Tops’ 1966 hit, which reached number 16.\nWriter Jennifer Nadel, the co-director of Compassion in Politics, wrote that she was “heartbroken” at the passing of her “dear friend”, adding: “The most gentle, loving, beautiful and mischievous soul, now on the next stage of his journey. Blessed to have known and loved him.”"

    "raw_text": "Levi’s has said that “rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could drive British shoppers away from its denim.\nThe company, which distributes Levi’s and Dockers clothing brands, issued the warning in its UK accounts, where it reported sales had risen 8.8% to £96.8m and pre-tax profits were up 23% to £9.6m. It said the Levi’s brand had “retained its attractiveness despite a tense consumer climate and declining customer frequency in the retail sector”.\nHowever, the accounts recently filed at Companies House listed one of its key risks and uncertainties was potentially changing sentiment towards US brands that could lead shoppers to develop “increasing willingness” to choose more “national or European” products.\nThe risk was listed alongside other issues including competition from retailer’s own-label products and pressure on its department store stockists from “increased online competition and inflexible rents”.\nIt said apparel brands were also competing with “more basic needs” and there was a risk that high inflation “has a direct impact on the willingness and ability of consumer to spend their reduced available money in apparel and fashion products”.\nLevi’s UK arm, which employs just over 1,600 people in the UK according to its accounts, is one of the first US brands to openly raise fears about the impact of the Trump administration on sales, in comments first reported by the Daily Telegraph.\nOne brand that has clearly suffered in the UK is Tesla, which is led by Donald Trump’s former right-hand man Elon Musk. Tesla sales in the UK more than halved in July, according to data from the main industry body. The electric vehicle brand’s UK market share shrank to 0.7% in July, from 1.67% a year ago.\nIn Canada, protests against US-derived goods has been blamed for a slump in sales of Jack Daniel’s whiskey, which many retailers have removed from their shelves.\nThere have been reports of Canadian shoppers turning US-made or owned products upside down in stores so they can be identified and avoided by fellow shoppers. The Maple Scan app also helps Canadians check barcodes to see if grocery purchases have parent companies in the US.\nTrump has sent shock waves through global trade with his “liberation day” tariffs that set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s trading partners, and were topped up with “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he has argued have unfairly treated the US.\nA federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled on Friday that most of the tariff policies were illegal in a ruling that will not take effect until 14 October.\nThe judgment is likely to lead to a supreme court decision on whether Trump has the legal right as president to decide US trade policy."

    "raw_text": "As Elon Musk has embraced Donald Trump and various far-right conspiracy theories, he has left behind an aghast cohort of Tesla owners who suddenly feel embarrassed by their own cars. Many of them are now publicly displaying their dismay at Musk on their vehicles.\nSales of anti-Musk stickers have boomed since the world’s richest man declared his support for Trump and helped propel him to victory in the US presidential election, as owners of Teslas, the car brand headed by Musk, try to distance themselves from the South African-born multibillionaire.\n“Sales have really spiked. The day after the election was the biggest day ever,” said Matt Hiller, a Hawaii-based aquarium worker who sells a range of stickers online that denounce Musk. “People saw a billionaire supervillain buy his way into the administration and it rubbed them the wrong way.”\nHiller started the sticker range last year after deciding against buying a Tesla due to Musk’s “amplifying of horrible people and silencing of others” on X, formerly Twitter, another of his companies. Several hundred stickers a day are now being sold, primarily to Tesla owners, Hiller said, bearing texts such as “Anti Elon Tesla Club” or “I Bought This Before Elon Went Crazy”, or a picture of Musk in clown makeup with the words “Space Clown”.\n“People keep telling me that they feel they can drive their Teslas again with these stickers,” said Hiller, who has had to set aside part of his house to accommodate the growing operation. Hiller devises slogans such as “Elon Ate My Cat”, a reference to a debunked falsehood about migrants eating pets in Ohio, that are then sold on Etsy and Amazon. “People are shaken up. It’s a relief really to see they are awake,” he said of the surging demand.\nMusk, who has an estimated wealth of $314bn, was once considered an environmental hero and technology pioneer by many US liberals after turning Tesla into the most valuable car company in the world while warning that “climate change is the biggest threat that humanity faces this century, except for AI”.\nBut his reputation among electric vehicle-buying liberals curdled as he used X to trumpet far-right conspiracies, fulminated about the “woke mind virus” and enthusiastically promoted Trump, even appearing at the president-elect’s rallies and funding campaign operations for him in key battleground states.\nMusk is now intimately involved in Trump’s incoming administration, heading a new “Department of Government Efficiency” that plans mass layoffs of US government workers. Some Tesla owners have been left horrified. “I thought Elon was progressing our country, but he’s turned out to be kind of an evil person. It’s scary for someone with that sort of money to be so close to a politician,” said Mika Houston, a gymnastics teacher in Las Vegas who has had a Tesla Model 3 for the past three years.\n“I still love my car, but I think about whether I’m endorsing that sort of behavior when I drive it. I’m embarrassed driving this car around after the election, thinking about the man behind it,” said Houston, who has bought an “Anti Elon Tesla Club” magnet for her car and is mulling whether to sell it.\nPamela Perkins, a photographer who lives in the Tesla heartland of California’s Silicon Valley, has a Model Y but is among a group of friends who are all considering ditching their Teslas.\n“I’m turning 80 in January so I thought I’d have a sporty car that I could race anyone when the light turns green,” Perkins said of her purchase. “There was a time I thought Elon Musk was a genius but he went bad very quickly. I remember saying to my husband I should sell this car and send a message, for my own conscience.\n“A lot of people have asked if I’m going to sell the car, I have a friend who was about to get a Tesla but decided not to because of him. But [Musk] doesn’t care about us, he has bigger fish to fry. He wants to colonize Mars.”\nIt’s unclear whether this backlash against Musk will hurt Tesla, which remains the dominant electric car company in the US. Sales have struggled somewhat this year, with a 7% drop forecast in the latest quarter compared with the same period in 2023, although analysts put this down to increased competition from other car makers and a stale Tesla lineup that has little changed apart from the much-hyped Cybertruck.\n“Tesla isn’t the only player in town now and they haven’t been aggressive in putting new products out,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.\n“Elon is Tesla: his persona definitely has an impact upon the perception of the brand, and he has been polarizing. I don’t think we’ve seen any impacts in sales because of this – yet. I do think this will happen, but it remains to be seen which consumers he attracts and which he loses.”\nAnother uncertainty is how Tesla will be affected by policies pursued by Trump. The incoming president has called the shift to electric cars “lunacy”, said that supporters of such vehicles should “rot in hell” and vowed to strip away incentives to purchase them. Trump has somewhat tempered his invective against electric vehicles following Musk’s endorsement but is still planning to remove a key tax credit for new buyers.\nFor now, though, there is a windfall for those selling anti-Musk merchandise. “I feel like people really wanted to make their voices heard in some way, even as passive as it is,” said Stacey Davis, who started selling Musk bumper stickers a year ago. Davis, who has a Tesla, said she has had an 800% increase in sales of these bumper stickers on Etsy since the election.\n“Elon started not aligning with what I believe in and he just started being really weird, extra,” said Davis. “At first we’re like, OK, he’s just one of those eccentric types of people. But then when he went into his political stuff and I was like, oh no, this is not it.”\nWith a Trump presidency looming over the US for the next four years, Musk’s involvement is a bittersweet prospect for some sellers. “I’d be happy for him to disappear from public discourse and just be another rich guy,” Hiller said. “If I never sell another Elon sticker that’s fine. I’d rather him just be gone for the country’s sake and I can go back to making stickers of fish.”"

    "raw_text": "The multi-billionaire owner of the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos, continued facing criticism throughout the weekend because executives from his aerospace company met with Donald Trump on the same day the newspaper prevented its editorial team from publishing an endorsement of his opponent in the US presidential election.\nSenior news and opinion leaders at the Washington Post flew to Miami in late September 2024 to meet with Bezos, who had reservations about the paper issuing an endorsement in the 5 November election, the New York Times reported.\nAmazon and the space exploration company Blue Origin are among Bezos-owned businesses that still compete for lucrative federal government contracts.\nAnd the Post on Friday announced it would not endorse a candidate in the 5 November election after its editorial board had already drafted its endorsement of Kamala Harris.\nFriday’s announcement did not mention Amazon or Blue Origin. But within hours, high-ranking officials of the latter company briefly met with Trump after a campaign speech in Austin, Texas, as the Republican nominee seeks a second presidency.\nTrump met with the Blue Origin chief executive officer, David Limp, and vice-president of government relations, Megan Mitchell, the Associated Press reported.\nMeanwhile, CNN reported that the Amazon CEO, Andy Jassy, had also recently reached out to speak with the former president by phone.\nThose reported overtures were eviscerated by the Washington Post editor-at-large and longtime columnist Robert Kagan, who resigned on Friday. On Saturday, he argued that the meeting Blue Origin executives had with Trump would not have taken place if the Post had endorsed the Democratic vice-president as it planned.\n“Trump waited to make sure that Bezos did what he said he was going to do – and then met with the Blue Origin people,” Kagan told the Daily Beast on Saturday. “Which tells us that there was an actual deal made, meaning that Bezos communicated, or through his people, communicated directly with Trump, and they set up this quid pro quo.”\nThe Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, hired by Bezos in January, defended the paper’s owner by claiming the decision to spike the Harris endorsement was his. But that has done little to defuse criticism from within the newspaper’s ranks as well as the wave of subscription cancelations that has met the institution.\nEighteen opinion columnists at the Washington Post signed a dissenting column against the decision, calling it “a terrible mistake”. The paper has already made endorsements this election cycle, including in a US Senate seat race in Maryland. The Washington Post endorsed Hillary Clinton when Trump won the presidency in 2016. It endorsed Joe Biden when Trump lost in 2020, despite Trump’s pledges to retaliate against anyone who opposed him.\nIn their criticism of the Post’s decision on Friday, former and current employees cited the dangers to democracy posed by Trump, who has openly expressed his admiration for authoritarian rule amid his appeals for voters to return him to office.\nThe former Washington Post journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who broke the Watergate story, called the decision “disappointing, especially this late in the electoral process”.\nThe former Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron said in a post on X: “This is cowardice with democracy as its casualty.”\nThe cartoon team at the paper published a dark formless image protesting against the non-endorsement decision, playing on the “democracy dies in darkness” slogan that the Post adopted in 2017, five years after its purchase by Bezos.\nHigh-profile readers, including the bestselling author Stephen King as well as the former congresswoman and vocal Trump critic Liz Cheney, announced the cancellation of their Washington Post subscriptions with many others in protest.\nThe Post’s non-endorsement came shortly after the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong, refused to allow the editorial board publish an endorsement of Harris.\nMany pointed out how the stances from the Post and the LA Times seems to fit the definition of “anticipatory obedience” as spelled out in On Tyranny, Tim Snyder’s bestselling guide to authoritarianism. Snyder defines the term as “giving over your power to the aspiring authoritarian” before the authoritarian is in position to compel that handover.\nBezos is the second wealthiest person in the world behind Elon Musk, who has become a prominent supporter of Trump’s campaign for a second presidency. He bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250m.\nIn 2021, Bezos stepped down as CEO of Amazon, claiming during a podcast interview that he intended to devote more time to Blue Origin.\nThe New York Times reported Bezos had begun to get more involved in the paper in 2023 as it faced significant financial losses, a stream of employee departures and low morale.\nHis pick of Lewis as publisher in January seemingly did little to help morale at the paper. Employees and devotees of the paper were worried that Lewis was brought on to the Post despite allegations that he “fraudulently obtained phone and company records in newspaper articles” as a journalist in London, as the New York Times reported.\nNonetheless, in a memo to newsroom leaders in June 2024, Bezos wrote: “The journalistic standards and ethics at the Post will not change.”"

    "raw_text": "After backpacker Rebecca Burke was arrested and locked up for nearly three weeks by US immigration officials, she started urging people not to travel to America.\nBritons seem to have listened: the number of UK residents visiting the US was down 14.3% in March compared with the same month in 2024, official figures show.\nAnalysts believe that Donald Trump’s claims that other countries were “cheating” Americans, and reports of deportations, may have had a chilling effect on travel to the US. But the March dip may be simply an early warning of a bigger fall in the summer, because tourists typically book holidays months in advance.\n“Once we get into July, August, September, most of those trips will have been booked,” said David Edwards, founder of the Scattered Clouds travel consultancy.\n“But if there is less global trade, there will be less international business travel. Business travel is booked with a much shorter lead time so if there is uncertainty, business travel could take a swifter hit.”\nSpring is difficult for travel companies to analyse because Easter moves in the calendar. So could the comparative drop simply be the effect of the Easter school holidays falling in March 2024? It seems unlikely, Edwards said, because the figures from the US National Travel and Tourism Office show an even bigger drop, of 16%, compared with March 2019 when Easter was on 21 April and Trump was nearing the end of his first term.\nTravellers from other countries also seemed to avoid the US in March – visitors from western Europe who stayed at least one night in the US were down 17% in March, year-on-year. German visitors were down 28.2% and Spanish ones down 24.6% compared with 2024. Overall, global travel to the US was down 11.6%. UK residents make up the largest number of overseas visitors to the US, with 3.9 million a year.\nTTG, the travel industry magazine, published a poll last week showing that two-thirds of travel agents it contacted believed there had been a downturn in bookings, while only 12% of operators said their business had not been affected. Demand for hotel rooms in the US may also be falling. Jan Freitag, national director of hospitality analytics at CoStar, which tracks hotel room occupancy, said that the strong dollar had led to an 8% fall in visitors in 2024.\n“So now with the rhetoric that’s going on, I’m super worried that we’re going to continue to see travel numbers below 2019, maybe even decelerating from 2024,” he said. “Saying ‘you’re cheating us, you have a surplus, so we’re going to put a tariff on you’ – that rhetoric is not very welcoming.”\nResearch by VisitBritain in 2022 showed that international travellers ranked “destination is a welcoming place to visit” as the second most important factor in choosing a holiday.\nAfter publicity around deportations of tourists, including Germans and Australians, the UK and German governments have updated their travel advice to warn citizens of the risk. The incidents may also harm the appeal of the 2026 World Cup – currently due to take place in the US, Canada and Mexico, with the later knockout stages entirely in the US – and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028, Freitag said.\n“Next year will be very big … If I’m a German father with two boys and I want to show them the World Cup, am I really going to spend $1,000 a pop on an airfare, plus hotel, plus the ticket, if there’s even a remote chance that I will not be able to make it into the country? I’m not going to take that risk. Not everyone will think that, but probably some people will.”\nClare Collins, co-founder and chief operations officer for CT Business Travel, said that she expected there would be a decline in leisure travel to the US in the summer, but had not yet seen an impact on business travel.\n“We’re not seeing any dramatic effects yet for business travel, but that could change in two weeks,” she said. “I think [in] the long-term leisure market, people will choose to spend their money elsewhere.”\nIf the March dip turns into a major fall in travellers from the UK, some airlines may start cutting routes, Edwards said, and that could have an impact on the British economy.\nThe UK travel industry recovered from the Covid pandemic mostly because American tourists flocked to Europe, buoyed by a strong dollar that made hotels more affordable in London and Paris.\n“Europeans may be thinking ‘I’m not so sure that the US is a welcoming place to visit’,” Edwards said. “Equally, it might be that Americans are thinking ‘how welcome would I be if I go to Europe this year?’”"

    "raw_text": "American Requiem, the opening track of Beyoncé’s eighth studio album, is many things. It offers a touch of state-of-the-nation address – “Can we stand for something? Now is the time to face the wind” – and a sprinkling of the kind of vague but apparently personal lyrics that send social media into a frenzy of decoding: what are her “father’s sins” that Beyoncé has apparently “cleansed” herself of? Who are the “fairweather friends” for whom she claims to be planning “a funeral”?\nIt’s also a loud statement of what you might call Beyoncé’s bona fides. She is, she avers, “the grandbaby of a moonshine man [from] Gadsden, Alabama” who furthermore has roots in Louisiana. “They used to say I spoke too country,” she protests, adding: “What could be more country than that?”\nIn a sense, this all feels quite surprising. For years, Beyoncé has been in an unassailable critical position: everything she’s released has been greeted with huge sales, ecstatic reviews and lengthy reflections on her peerless artistry, thus affording her the ability to do whatever she wants. Equally, you can see why she might want to shore up her position when launching a venture into country and western – which is very much what Cowboy Carter has been trailed as – and not merely because her performance with the Dixie Chicks (now the Chicks) at the 2016 Country Music Association awards, while garnering the usual critical acclaim, attracted adverse online comment from viewers, some of it flatly racist.\nCountry isn’t so much a genre as a law unto itself. It’s traditionally very wary of musical outsiders – be they the Byrds or Ray Charles – and presided over by a notoriously reactionary Nashville establishment. Moreover, it’s traditionally a musical voice of the rural poor and working class: you don’t want to be perceived as a superstar dilettante who’s decided to dabble just because you can.\nCowboy Carter duly presents itself as a major statement – 27 tracks and 80 minutes long – and arrives complete with co-signs from Nashville elders. There are spoken word interludes by Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, the latter drawing comparison between perfidious old Jolene and Becky with the Good Hair, the love rival in Beyoncé’s celebrated 2016 track Sorry. The latter’s favour is repaid with a cover of Jolene itself, which Parton has been publicly petitioning Beyoncé to record for years, albeit with a new middle eight and coda alongside fresh lyrics that substitute swaggering menace and threats for the original’s desperate pleading – desperate pleading not really being on-brand where Beyoncé is concerned.\nElsewhere, the singer circumvents the issue of what you sing a country song about if you’re worth an estimated $800m (£634m) by indulging in murder ballad-esque storytelling on Daughter – which underlines the drama with a burst of 18th-century opera, and recasting her early years in Destiny’s Child in Nashville-friendly terms on 16 Carriages: “At 15 the innocence was gone astray / Had to leave my home at an early age,” she sings, making herself sound more like an outcast unmarried mother than someone who went on tour supporting Dru Hill and SWV.\nYou can say that amounts to laying it on a bit thick, but both Daughter and 16 Carriages are fantastic songs: acoustic guitars playing host to strong melodies and, on the latter, a vocal delivery that carries the distinctive patterns of rap. In fact, there are a lot of fantastic songs in the first part of Cowboy Carter, although its sheer length starts proving a problem. Her cover of the Beatles’ Blackbird is astute – Paul McCartney wrote it in tribute to the Little Rock Nine, a group of nine Black students who faced discrimination after enrolling in the all-white Little Rock high school in 1957 – if inessential, and there’s a distinct qualitative sag in the middle. It’s remedied by the simple expedient of going wildly off-piste: if the lambent soft-rock of Bodyguard gets you wondering whether the “departure into country” tag strictly fits Cowboy Carter, the sudden appearance of a straightforward hip-hop track, Spaghetti, confirms that it isn’t.\nThereafter the album goes nuts. Ya Ya offers a fantastic early psychedelic soul-influenced stomp that throws in a sample of Nancy Sinatra’s These Boots Are Made for Walking, an interpolation from the Beach Boys’ Good Vibrations and what sounds like a lyrical reference to Mickey and Sylvia’s 1958 hit Love Is Strange. Riverdance and II Hands II Heaven return to the house music influence of Beyoncé’s last album Renaissance. Oh Louisiana is 52 seconds of bluesy funk with a vocal sped up to helium pitch. It’s all incredibly well done and hugely entertaining, but the sense that the album is clinging on to its original concept by its fingernails – throwing in the odd lyric about rhinestones or whisky and the occasional intimation of pedal steel guitar – is hard to avoid.\nYou wonder if Cowboy Carter might have worked better split into two separate albums, with one concentrating purely on the country-influenced/acoustic material: there are moments when it starts to feel less like a coherent statement than one of those long 21st-century albums that offers listeners a selection box of tracks to pick and choose playlist additions from. Or perhaps its wild lurches into eclecticism are the point. Unwieldy as it is, it displays its author’s ability to bend musical styles to her will, be they country, hip-hop or the baroque post-psychedelic easy listening that seems to lurk beneath the vocal gymnastics of My Rose. If the results don’t quite hold together, Cowboy Carter still proves Beyoncé is impressively capable of doing whatever she wants."

    "raw_text": "American Eagle is a US-founded fashion brand that sells jeans, shrunken “baby” T-shirts and cropped sweatshirts to predominantly tween and teenage girls. On TikTok, users gush about their clothes in outfit-of-the-day posts or shopping hauls. This week, however, the brand found itself facing backlash over its new campaign, starring the 27-year-old White Lotus and Euphoria actor Sydney Sweeney, in which critics are alleging American Eagle uses the language of eugenics to try to sell denim.\nThe campaign depicts Sweeney in a denim shirt and baggy jeans provocatively posing as a male voice says: “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” In one now-viral clip, Sweeney is filmed pasting a campaign poster on to a billboard. The poster’s text reads “Sydney Sweeney has great genes jeans”. In another video that has since been removed from American Eagle’s social media channels, Sweeney, who has blond hair and blue eyes, says: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality, and even eye colour. My jeans are blue.”\nCritics were quick to point out the implications of the advert’s wordplay. In one video that has had more than 3m views, a TikTok user compared it to “fascist propaganda,” adding: “a blonde haired, blue-eyed white woman is talking about her good genes, like, that is Nazi propaganda”. On the brand’s own channels, users are battling it out in the comments section. “It’s giving ‘Subtle 1930’s Germany’,” reads one. Another person posted: “The woke crowd needs to leave the room.” Even the US senator Ted Cruz has weighed in. Reposting a news story on X, he commented: “Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well ...”\nAccording to Sophie Gilbert, a staff writer at the Atlantic and author of the book Girl on Girl which explores how pop culture is shaped by misogyny: “The slogan ‘Sydney Sweeney has good jeans’ obviously winks at the obsession with eugenics that’s so prevalent among the modern right.” Dr Sarah Cefai, a senior lecturer in gender and cultural studies at Goldsmiths, University of London, agrees. “Honestly, what were they thinking, that a white supremacist fantasy has permission to be aired so conspicuously?”\nAria Halliday, an associate professor in gender and women’s studies, African American and Africana studies and author of Buy Black: How Black Women Transformed US Pop Culture, isn’t surprised by the ad. In recent years, she says, “we have seen an influx of media reasserting the beauty of thin, white, blond, and blue-eyed people,” with many brands “invested in re-presenting the wholesomeness and sanctity of conservative white values.”\nCritics have also zeroed in on the campaign’s focus on Sweeney’s body. In one clip the camera zooms in on the actor’s breasts – lingering in a way that Gilbert sees as “leering and unapologetic” – as Sweeney says: “My body’s composition is determined by my jeans.” The camera then cuts back to Sweeney’s face as she shouts: “Hey, eyes up here!” For Cefai, “its sexualisation of the viewer via its voyeurism exposes western sexism as a racialised fantasy of whiteness”. American Eagle were approached for comment by the Guardian but did not respond.\nFashion campaigns are notorious for purposefully sparking controversy, but the denim genre is a particularly seedy seam. In a 1980s Calvin Klein campaign, a 15-year-old Brooke Shields mused: “You know what gets between me and my Calvin’s? Nothing.” In 1995, another Calvin Klein ad featured models including Kate Moss being filmed in a basement as they undid the top button of their jeans and were asked: “Are you nervous?” It was criticised for alluding to child exploitation.\nThe American Eagle campaign comes at a time when the US is witnessing a cultural shift centering whiteness as well as more conservative gender roles, while the Maga movement has been linked with promoting a “soft eugenics” way of thinking. In 2025, there are new factors reinforcing old stereotypes. For Halliday, the rise of GLP-1 medications for weight loss and the record high unemployment of Black women in the US all feed into a wider cultural shift that is “about recentering whiteness as what America is and who Americans look like.”\nSome fashion imagery is reflecting this wider regression. The blacklisted photographer Terry Richardson is shooting for magazines and brands again, while Dov Charney, whose role as CEO of American Apparel was terminated after allegations of sexual misconduct, is now making content for his new brand that resembles the heavily sexualised noughties style of his former brand’s advertising.\nFor American Eagle, a brand whose biggest demographic is 15- to 25-year-old females, to tailor their campaign to the male gaze seems retrograde, if not downright creepy. However, Jane Cunningham, co-author of Brandsplaining: Why Marketing is (Still) Sexist and How to Fix It, says many gen Z-ers who are fed a “hypersexualised visual diet” on social media may buy into the strategy. “Their attitude may be that they are ‘owning’ their sexuality by being overtly sexual in the way they present,” she says, pointing to the pop star Sabrina Carpenter as another example of someone who has also been accused of catering to the heterosexual male gaze.\nHalliday says that while “Black girls are rarely the target audience for ads,” some may still be curious to try the jeans: “the desire to be perceived as beautiful is hard to ignore,” she says.\nMany gen Z-ers may not have experienced this genre of advertising, or “intentional provocation as branding strategy”, before, says Gilbert, for whom the campaign also reminds her of 90s Wonderbra ads with their “Hello Boys” slogan. But maybe they will come to see through it. They are “extremely savvy as consumers”, she points out. “They have the kind of language and expertise in terms of deconstructing media that I couldn’t have dreamed of utilising as a teen during the 1990s. And they know when someone is trying to play them, which seems to be happening here.\nShe adds: “It all feels like it was cooked up in a conference room to provoke maximum controversy and maximum outrage, and to get maximum attention.” And it seems – in the business sense at least – to be working. Since the campaign launched, American Eagle’s stock has shot up almost 18%.\nTo read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure – subscribe to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox every Thursday."

    "raw_text": "A new ad campaign from American Eagle starring the US actor Sydney Sweeney is meeting backlash, with some critics alleging online that the advertisement’s punny use of the phrase “great jeans” is a coded promotion of eugenics.\nIn the campaign, the 27-year-old Euphoria and White Lotus star is dressed in American Eagle denim outfits, accompanied by the tagline “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans”.\nIn one video clip shared by American Eagle on Instagram, Sweeney – who is blond and blue-eyed – is standing in front of a poster of herself with text that reads “Sydney Sweeney has great genes”. In the video, the word “genes” gets crossed out and is replaced with the word “jeans”.\nAnother video from the campaign features Sweeney saying: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color. My jeans are blue.”\nThe campaign has drawn mixed reactions online.\nSome social media users have dubbed the campaign as “tone deaf” and accused it of echoing rhetoric associated with eugenics and white supremacy.\nOn X, one user wrote that “getting a blue eyed, blonde, white women and focusing your campaign around her having perfect genetics feels weird, especially considering the current state of America,” where one of the dominant political stories has been the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion – or DEI – initiatives.\nOne user on TikTok argued that “the words we use are never unintentional” and that “for American Eagle to say Sydney Sweeney has good genes is not an accident”.\n“This is a dog whistle to the rise of conservatism in this country,” they said.\nMeanwhile, others, including some on the US political right have praised the actor and the campaign for delivering a blow to “wokeness” and “woke” advertising.\n“Woke advertising is dead, Sydney Sweeney killed it,” one X user wrote, invoking a term that some conservatives use to criticize DEI measures.\nAnd some observers have described the backlash to the campaign as overblown and an exaggeration.\nOne TikTok user said: “I personally don’t see why it’s causing all this controversy – to me, it’s just an ad for jeans.”\nAs of Tuesday morning, neither Sweeney nor American Eagle had publicly addressed the criticism and backlash.\nNeither American Eagle nor a representative for Sweeney immediately responded to a request for comment from the Guardian.\nAs part of the campaign, American Eagle is releasing “The Sydney Jean” made in collaboration with Sweeney, which features a butterfly motif on the back pocket.\nIn the announcement from the company, the brand said that the motif “represents domestic violence awareness, which Sydney is passionate about”. The brand also said that “100% of the purchase price from The Sydney Jean will be donated to Crisis Text Line, a nonprofit offering free, 24/7, confidential mental health support to anyone in need.”\nIn the press release, American Eagle described the “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” campaign as a “return to essential denim dressing and a celebration of what the beloved brand does best: making customers look and feel good in AE Jeans”.\nThe company added that “Sweeney’s girl next door charm and main character energy – paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously – is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.”\nThe American Eagle campaign is not the first time that Sweeney has been involved in political controversy. In 2022, she faced criticism after she was photographed at her mother’s birthday party where several of the guests were seen wearing hats that called to mind those which bear Trump’s Make America great again (Maga) slogan.\nMeanwhile, in May, she achieved internet virality by having a hand in selling soap made with her bath water, which virtually sold out immediately after it was released on the Dr Squatch website."

    "raw_text": "Belstaff, the struggling British fashion brand known for its heritage motorcycle gear, has been bought by the sportswear group Castore from the billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos.\nUnder the deal, the terms of which have not been disclosed, Ineos will make a “significant strategic investment” in Castore’s holding company.\nBelstaff has reported losses every year since it was bought by Ratcliffe’s oil and chemicals empire in 2017, with the most recent published accounts showing a pre-tax loss of £18.3m in the year to December 2023. Sales fell 3.6% to £57.6m, according to accounts filed at Companies House.\nBelstaff was founded in 1924 in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and is known for its waxed jackets once promoted by Kate Moss and David Beckham. It was bought by Ineos in 2017 from JAB Holding, the German investment firm which owns the British coffee shop chain Pret a Manger and previously owned the luxury footwear brand Jimmy Choo.\nRatcliffe, who has a net worth of £17bn, according to this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, became one of Britain’s wealthiest men after building a chemicals empire from the £84m purchase of a Belgian oil refinery in 1998. However, he has faced growing concerns over the state of his heavily-indebted, loss-making chemicals group, alongside other business interests including the Premier League strugglers Manchester United.\nTom Beahon, the co-founder and chief executive of Castore, whose backers include the British tennis player Andy Murray, said Belstaff had returned to operating profit, which doesn’t include certain costs, in 2023.\n“Belstaff is a truly iconic brand with unparalleled heritage, and I have personally been a huge fan for a very long time,” he said. “Ineos and the management team at Belstaff have done a phenomenal job in steering the company back to profitability following a challenging period for the retail sector. To have the opportunity to take Belstaff through the next stage of its growth journey is a dream come true and a huge privilege.\n“We are also delighted that Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos is investing in Castore, which is a demonstration of commitment to our business and global growth ambitions, and we look forward to working together to deliver on this vision.”\nAshley Reed, the chair of Belstaff, said: “Castore is disrupting the sportswear market and has demonstrated phenomenal growth and resilience in recent years. Having witnessed their journey, we saw a unique opportunity to join forces and accelerate Belstaff’s transformation through shared knowledge and resources.”\nThe companies said Castore aimed to drive Belstaff’s growth using its online retail networks and expertise and supply chain.\nFounded in Liverpool in 2015 by the brothers Tom and Phil Beahon, Castore is now based in Manchester and has grown rapidly. In 2024 it acquired the professional team sports licence for Umbro for key markets including the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark."

    "raw_text": "Shein, the online fast-fashion retailer founded in China, increased sales in the UK by about a third to more than £2bn last year, overtaking the British rival Boohoo and closing in on Asos.\nThe company, which had been considering a £50bn float on the London Stock Exchange but is expected to list in Hong Kong, said profits rose 56% to £38.2m last year on which it paid £9.6m corporation tax, according to accounts filed at Companies House this week.\nShein, which sells mainly fashion but has also moved into other products including toys and beauty, said it had benefited from the opening of two new offices in King’s Cross and Manchester, the launch of a pop-up shop in Liverpool and a Christmas bus tour across 12 cities in the UK.\nThe strong trading figures are likely to increase pressure on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to tackle the “de minimis” rule that has underpinned the rise of the fast-growing online specialists Shein and Temu.\nReeves pledged to review the rule, which allows overseas sellers to send goods valued at £135 or less direct to British shoppers without paying any customs duty, after criticism by major retail bosses including Simon Wolfson at Next and Simon Roberts at Sainsbury’s.\nEarlier this month, Graham Bell, the chief executive of B&Q, said the rule was “killing the high street more than anything”.\nThe rapid rise of Shein, which bought the Missguided online brand from Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group in 2023, has piled pressure on UK online fashion retailers including Asos and Boohoo as well as low-price high street specialists such as Primark.\nFears of China’s retailers and manufacturers dumping goods in the UK have grown since the US in May revoked its own de minimis exception for Chinese-made goods, under which parcels with a value of less than $800 (£600) shipped to individuals had been exempt from import tax. It recently announced plans to scrap the tax break for items from all countries later this month.\nThe EU said in February it would phase out its exemption on customs duties for low-value parcels.\nFounded by the entrepreneur Chris Xu, Shein is headquartered in Singapore and runs most of its operations from China but sells all its goods outside the country and has recently begun manufacturing in other countries including Turkey and Brazil.\nThe retailer, which has almost trebled the number of its UK employees to 91 in the past year, reached a valuation of $100bn in an April 2022 fundraising round, making it the third-most-valuable startup in the world.\nHowever, expectations of the valuation have been slashed in the past year amid changes to US import rules and concerns about conditions in its supply chain.\nThe failure of Shein representatives to reassure a committee of UK MPs at a hearing earlier this year that its products did not include cotton produced in the Xinjiang region of China, which has been linked to forced Uyghur labour, prompted an MP to accuse one of “wilful ignorance”."

    "raw_text": "Price rises and strong sales of closed-toe clogs helped the shoe maker Birkenstock beat profit expectations as it became the latest beneficiary of the “ugly shoe summer”.\nThe German sandal maker said sales rose 16% in the three months to the end of June, if currency fluctuations were excluded. The average price of its products sold rose by about 5% and the number of items sold rose by about 8%.\nThere was demand for its suede leather closed-toe Boston clogs, which sell for as much as £250 and generally cost more than the brand’s more well-known sandals, which are priced from £105 for a leather version.\nTotal sales at the company, which listed on the US stock market in October 2023 valued at $7.5bn (£5.5bn), rose 12% to €635m (£546m) in the quarter with net profit up 73% to €129m.\nThis summer there has been an upturn in popularity of quirky footwear, from rubber flip-flops to glove-like fitness shoes that fit each individual toe.\nHowever, the “ugly” footwear brand Crocs last week reported a 30% slump in sales amid new competition from split-toe shoes to flip-flops and Birkenstock’s clogs, which come in plastic as well as leather.\nKnown for its cork-lined sandals, Birkenstock pledged to make its offering more varied, with more clogs, trainers, shoes and boots when it launched on the stock market.\nThe company makes 95% of its shoes at its own factories in Germany. Its chief executive, Oliver Reichert, said it was “well-positioned to manage the impact” of new US import tariffs of 15% on goods imported from the EU.\nHe said the higher costs would be managed through a combination of “pricing adjustment, cost discipline and inventory management to protect the long-term health and profitability of the Birkenstock brand”.\nReichert said that the company was on track to achieve full-year sales growth at the top end of expectations of 15% to 17%."

    "raw_text": "Shares in the US footwear company Crocs have slumped by almost 30% after it warned of falling sales because of tariffs, “super cautious” US consumers and signs the “ugly shoe” trend could be on the wane.\nThe foam clog and sandal maker’s shares fell by 29.2% on Thursday, after it predicted revenues could drop by between 9% and 11% in the current quarter, disappointing analysts who were expecting slight growth.\nIt also warned of a hit to profitability from Donald Trump’s tariffs – the latest wave of which came into force earlier that day – citing “continued uncertainty from evolving global trade policy and related pressures around the consumer”.\nThe share price plunge was its biggest one-day drop since 2011, taking its valuation to its lowest level for almost three years.\nAndrew Rees, the chief executive, said there was “ample evidence” that some consumers in North America were “super cautious; they’re not purchasing, they’re not even going to the stores, and we see traffic down”. He explained that “already choiceful” Americans were worried about current and future price increases.\nRees described the environment in the second half of the year as “concerning” and said that was clearly reflected in orders from the company’s retail partners.\nA cooling labour market, along with higher interest rates, rising inflation and uncertainty around Trump’s trade policies and his tax bill have led to Americans reining in their spending.\nOnce considered a fashion faux pas, sales of Crocs soared during the coronavirus pandemic when people sought out more comfortable footwear, and a gold pair of Crocs appeared on the Oscars red carpet in 2021. Earlier this week, Microsoft launched special anniversary edition Windows XP-themed Crocs.\nCrocs are made from a lightweight and odour-resistant special foam resin, and were initially marketed to sailors and water sport enthusiasts before they became more popular in the mid-00s.\nHowever, while Crocs have a broad appeal and are worn by celebrities including Drew Barrymore, Rees acknowledged customer tastes were changing with a trend “back towards athletic” footwear in favour of sports brands, before the men’s football World Cup next year and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028.\nSusan Healy, the chief financial officer, said tariffs would result in a $40m (£29.8m) hit in the second half of 2025 and $90m on an annual basis based on the company’s current sourcing mix.\nRees flagged a disproportionate impact of tariffs on its casual footwear HEYDUDE brand, acquired in late 2021. He said the company was taking measures such as keeping a close eye on expenses and reducing inventory “to protect brand health and profitability”, and had pulled back on promotions since May.\nThe Colorado-based company fell into the red in the second quarter with a pre-tax loss of $448.6m, compared with a profit of $296.4m the year before. Revenues rose by 3.4% to $1.1bn.\nMcDonald’s said this week that US customers on lower incomes were cutting back on fast food to save money. On Thursday, the fashion company Ralph Lauren said that while it had raised its full-year revenue outlook, it was “maintaining continued caution” on the global environment as it wanted to see “how consumers respond to the start of the fall holiday season and what will be an uncertain, potentially inflationary environment”."

    "raw_text": "Shoppers snapping up Burberry wellies, scarves and light jackets to wear at music festivals have helped the fashion brand to its best sales performance in 18 months despite lacklustre spending by tourists around the world.\nSales of the luxury British brand fell by 2% to £433m in the three months to the end of June, with a 1% decline at established stores, an improvement from the 6% fall in the previous quarter and the best performance since Christmas 2023.\nShares in Burberry rose by more than 4% on Friday morning on the better-than-expected performance, as CEO Joshua Schulman, who was appointed a year ago, attempts a turnaround.\nSales rose in Europe and the Americas but continued to fall in Asia, including its all-important Chinese market, which accounts for 30% of sales.\nSchulman, the former boss of the US fashion brand Coach, said: “Its a tough macro [environment] out there and we are taking things step by step but we are optimistic about the quarters ahead and the business in general.”\nHe said the company had appealed to “elite VIP” customers with events linked to its partnership with King Charles’s Highgrove estate and also to a younger luxury customer through festival-linked pop-ups featuring DJ sets located in shopping centres. A trial of dedicated “scarf bars” within stores have also gone well and the company plans to install 200 in total.\n“We are appealing to a much broader range of luxury consumers,” he said, with the change in marketing drawing in younger, high-spending extrovert consumers who want to stand out from the crowd, as well as more mature brand loyalists.\nAdam Cochrane, an analyst at Deutsche, said further growth was largely dependent on Burberry’s ability to “replicate the success” of its core products in other areas.\nThe company said it was “still in the early stages of our turnaround” with aims to continue simplifying the business and improving productivity and cashflow.\nIt expects to achieve £80m of its planned £100m cost cuts this financial year, with the remainder next year, and has already reorganised the business under four regional heads.\nThe company said in May it was cutting up to 1,700 jobs, including an entire shift at its Yorkshire raincoat factory, in an effort to make £60m in cost savings on top of a £40m savings programme announced in November.\nSchulman said Burberry’s autumn ranges were being “well received”, although the external environment “remains challenging”.\nHe added: “Over the past year, we have moved from stabilising the business to driving Burberry forward with confidence.\n“The improvement in our first-quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead.”\nHe called on the UK government to implement policies that would “encourage tourism” as he said: “International consumers are not shopping in the UK to the extent we would like due to the lack of a VAT refund scheme.” The scheme was phased out under the last government.\n“All luxury brands and all retail brands would benefit from that,” he said."

    "raw_text": "Nike has said it expects costs to increase by about $1bn (£728m) as a result of Donald Trump’s tariff war as the sportswear company looks to reduce its manufacturing in China.\nThe market value of the company has dropped by a third over the past year and it is taking action to reduce the hit, including increasing prices in the US and sourcing from other countries.\n“These tariffs represent a new and meaningful cost headwind,” said Matthew Friend, Nike’s chief financial officer. “With the new tariff rates in place today, we estimate a gross incremental cost increase to Nike of approximately $1bn. We intend to fully mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time.”\nLast year almost 60% of all Nike-branded apparel was made in Vietnam, China and Cambodia. Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured 95% of all Nike footwear last year.\n“We have strong relationships with our factory partners, and our leadership team is experienced in managing through disruption,” Friend said. “Nike has consistently been a top payer of US duties. We will optimise our sourcing mix and allocate production differently across countries to mitigate the new cost headwind into the United States.”\nHe said manufacturing capacity and capability still remains important to the company, despite the 60% tariff rate imposed by the US, accounting for about 16% of footwear imports to America.\nFriend said the business was working to minimise the impact on consumers.\nHowever, he added that the company would implement a “surgical price increase” in the US from this autumn, and will aim to reduce overheads through “corporate cost reduction”.\nFriend’s comments came as Nike reported its worst quarterly earnings in more than three years, as revenues slumped 12% to $11.1bn in the three months to the end of May.\nElliott Hill, the chief executive of Nike, said: “The results are where we planned. That said, we’re not happy with where we are.”\nMamta Valechha, an analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Nike continues to slump, with its fourth quarter the worst in at least two decades.”\nShe said the figures indicated Nike “may nearly be at rock bottom”, adding: “It has been a difficult period for Nike following the pandemic, and the threat of tariffs simply is not helping the situation for the company.”"

    "raw_text": "The departure of Anna Wintour as editor-in-chief of American Vogue leaves a bigger absence in the fashion world than would be left by the departure of any designer or supermodel.\nFor more than three decades, Wintour has held the official title of editor-in-chief of American Vogue – and an unofficial, but widely acknowledged, title of queen of fashion. At any catwalk show, the best seat in the house is automatically hers. Like Beyoncé and Madonna, she has no need of a last name; everyone refers to her simply as “Anna”, although few are bold enough to address her directly. She has been a constant, regal presence, crowned by the signature glossy bob and ever-present sunglasses.\nWintour’s status has been built not just on ego, but on how much she has done for fashion. She has amplified the place of fashion in culture beyond all recognition. The ambition and bravado of fashion today – from Louis Vuitton hiring the Grammy-winning musician Pharrell Williams as creative director and taking over an entire district of central Paris for his debut show, to blockbuster fashion exhibitions such as the V&A’s Coco Chanel retrospective becoming fixtures on the art world calendar – owes a vast debt to the vision of Wintour. An early instigator of putting actors, pop stars and politicians on the cover of her magazine, she understood instinctively that a Vogue cover bequeathed an intangible but potent “soft power” that celebrities craved, and that Vogue’s role as gatekeeper to that power could be leveraged in Washington and in Hollywood, as well as at the fashion weeks of New York, London, Paris and Milan.\nThe cartoonish perception of a woman who is powerful simply because she lords over a world of ditsy underlings who are petrified by her is very far from the truth. Wintour grew the fashion world into an empire, making fashion itself bigger and more powerful, and rode high by keeping hold of the reins. She is unusual in being both a glamorous A-list celebrity who wields personal star power, and a gifted behind-the-scenes operator, always on manoeuvres behind those dark glasses. In the court of Vogue, she has been both King Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell, commanding ceremonial power while also pulling the strings behind the scenes.\nIt is, however, entirely true that most of those around her are intimidated by her. Her operational mode resembles that of a military commander: decisions are made swiftly, and she does not suffer fools gladly. In public, her emotional tone hovers around a cool courtesy, dipping to frosty lows if displeased by unpunctuality or incompetence. This is a persona that Wintour – who in private is devoted to her family, is a tennis superfan, a passionate supporter of the arts and a witty and phenomenally well-read conversationalist – has crafted carefully. Her image was enshrined in 2006 by the cinema release of The Devil Wears Prada, in which Meryl Streep played Miranda Priestly, a New York fashion editor. It was based on a book by a former assistant of Wintour’s, and the starring role was widely assumed to be modelled on her.\nThe imperious “Nuclear Wintour” persona has served her well. In 2012, it was widely rumoured that Wintour, a heavyweight fundraiser for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, was in the running to be appointed the US ambassador in London. The rumour turned out to be unfounded, but the degree of gossip mill traction for the idea of a magazine journalist being appointed to a high-powered position in international diplomacy is testament to the gravitas and prestige of Wintour’s reputation.\nWintour was born into journalism. Her father, Charles Wintour, was editor of the London Evening Standard for much of her childhood. She began her career in her birth city before moving to New York in her 20s, recrossing the Atlantic to become editor of British Vogue in 1985. That job was only a staging post for the highly ambitious Wintour, who achieved her goal of editing American Vogue three years later. Her keenly developed instinct for which way the wind was blowing was evident from the start: when the printers received the image for her first cover, they called the Vogue office concerned that there had been a mistake. The photo featured the model Michaela Bercu in faded blue denim – the first time jeans had appeared on the cover of Vogue. The post-dress-code informality that was to transform the fashion industry in the last decades of the 20th century was already being hinted at.\nIt is a stretch to imagine Wintour, whose daily regime as editor began with rising at 4.30am to play an hour’s tennis before a 6am blowdry, fading into gentle retirement. Her daughter, Bee, who works in the theatre world, once said that the lesson her mother was most keen to instil in her children was a work ethic. Bee recalled how, as a high school student attending a Vogue gala, she asked the guest sitting next to her to test her on Latin American history, as she had a test at school the next morning. But there is more to Wintour than the ice queen image. Her devotion to tennis is such that she would even play hooky from New York fashion week when shows clashed with the US Open tournament, taking a seat courtside instead.\nThe timing – halfway through the menswear fashion shows – left fashion puzzled, but make more sense from a tennis fan’s perspective. With Jack Draper poised to fill the gap in British tennis left by Andy Murray, and a simmering rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, her departure is Vogue’s loss but SW19’s gain."

    "raw_text": "It has been one of the breakout stories of the US Open: not the surprising second-round exits, nor the at-the-net spats, but the freshly shorn head and Barbie-pink tank top of the winner, Carlos Alcaraz. The outsize reaction to the Spanish phenomenon’s new look is the latest example of the final grand slam of the year attracting attention not just for sporting prowess, but for the style moments it serves.\nTake, for instance, former champion Naomi Osaka, who crashed out to Amanda Animisova in Thursday’s semi-final, but not before sparkling under the night lights in a custom Nike indigo zip-up jacket embellished with Swarovski crystals, worn over a bubble-hem minidress. For her opening match, she wore a rose headpiece. (Also present throughout Osaka’s tournament: a series of bejewelled Labubu dolls, created by accessories line A-Morir, with monikers including “Billie Jean Bling” and “Andre Swagassi”.) The getup was “really elaborate”, Osaka admitted in a press conference, but it’s the kind of statement outfit her fans have come to expect and appreciate.\nLacoste, the longtime kit supplier of Novak Djokovic, who was beaten by Alcaraz last week, has created a five-piece “GOAT” (greatest of all time) capsule, with the famous crocodile logo replaced by … well, you can guess which animal. But it was the 24-time slam winner’s first-round walk-on jacket that caused the most noise: a white windbreaker with laser-cut pieces of leather layered to form a low relief of a world map, and dotted with coloured tennis balls to match different court surfaces..\nWhile tennis has always had a close relationship with fashion, or at least, style – from Fred Perry’s sharp slacks and Suzanne Lenglen’s pleated skirt and headscarf to Andre Agassi’s denim shorts (originally made for John McEnroe, who turned them down) and Serena Williams’ catsuit – the walk from locker room to baseline has become its own catwalk.\nAdd to that last year’s hit tennis film, Challengers, and a fresh crop of personable stars with exciting play styles, and there is now a greater appetite for a sport that had rather lost its cultural way. US Open ticket sales are up 70% in the past five years.\n“Fashion brands of all price ranges are heavily interested in tennis right now because the sport is hot, and they follow the eyeballs and money,” says Jessica Schiffer, a fashion business journalist who writes the Hard Court newsletter. Behemoths like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta have all brought high-profile players on board (Jannik Sinner, Alcaraz and Lorenzo Musetti respectively) and smaller, boutique non-athleisure brands are creating lines that reference the tenniscore aesthetic. Meanwhile, Depop, the second-hand clothing app, has reported a 53% increase in searches for tennis skirts.\nThe wealthy, upper-class roots of the sport have long seen heritage brands associated with it, but now the likes of Rolex and Ralph Lauren are no longer dominating play.\nVenus Williams has a prominent relationship with Lacoste – she even wore a Pelagia Kolotouros-created dress to the Met Gala – but this year she worked with her stylist, Ronald Burton III, to further wow the Flushing Meadows front row. Among her looks were a Merino wool kit designed by US brand Luar ; a fun, butter-yellow shearling racket bag, custom made by ERL’s Eli Russell Linnetz; and a Pucci dress .\nDaniel-Yaw Miller, who covers fashion for the Sportsverse newsletter, predicts the influx of brand interest means traditional kit makers will have to up their game. While Nike might be ensuring Osaka dazzles and Alcaraz catches the eye in a lush plum twinset, its ready-to-wear tennis apparel has trended towards drab. Miller points to the number of stars, including the popular Americans Taylor Fritz and Frances Tiafoe, who have left the iconic Nike swoosh behind – following in the footsteps of Roger Federer, who moved from Nike to Uniqlo in a $300m deal back in 2018.\n“Nike is devoting the bulk of its resources to the top two players,” agrees Schiffer – Nike dresses Sinner and Alcaraz, and women’s No 1 Aryna Sabalenka – “so other players have made the savvy decision to look elsewhere, where they can get more money and specialised attention.”\nBritain’s Jack Draper, the world No 5 – as a Burberry ambassador and BFF of Anna Wintour – chose Queens to debut his partnership with the Californian athleisure brand Vuori.\n“Players have moved on – they no longer need to be just one of 20 players on a brand’s roster,” says Miller. Rather than be faced with an opponent in identical uniform – a common gripe of fans and, as far back as the mid-00s, Maria Sharapova – players are creating a more individualised image to boost their profile and earnings. Nine of the top 10 tennis earners in 2025 made more money from endorsements than prize money. Some players, such as Andrey Rublev and Taylor Townsend, have even set up their own labels.\nCoco Gauff, who has a collection with Miu Miu and New Balance, thinks the tennis and fashion crossover makes the sport more accessible: “We obviously have core tennis fans but fashion brings casual fans to the sport.” Gauff also believes looking good has a positive effect on her performance.\nBut a note of caution from Stuart Brumfitt, editor of tennis lifestyle magazine Bagel, on the more outré outfits: “The pros are trying to have these massive viral moments with these statement pieces, trying to mimic the tunnel walk that’s been a big thing in basketball for ages, or like boxers entering the ring in their flashy gowns. But, a lot of the time, it’s getting a bit Liberace, a little Las Vegas, in an attempt to steal the show. So I think, sometimes, it’s actually a bit anti-style.”\nUnderneath that somewhat gaudy Djokovic jacket? A slick, simple all-black look, reminiscent of Roger’s “Darth Federer” 2007 fit – one of the most loved looks of the past couple of decades. Simple, sleek – and not a diamante in sight."

When a reader clicks on an affiliate link, the tracking code assigns the user’s click a randomly generated number which Skimlinks then uses to identify subsequent purchases. Skimlinks then attributes a commission from the sale to the Guardian.\nThe Guardian is also part of the Amazon Associates programme. We use Skimlinks’ technology to add the Guardian’s unique Associate ID to Amazon affiliate links in our content. This Associate ID is assigned to a user’s click. Amazon then uses this Associate ID to identify subsequent purchases and attribute commission from the sale to the Guardian.\nHow will reader data be used by Skimlinks and Amazon?\nWhen a product is linked from a Guardian article or gallery, if the retailer has an affiliate programme, then the link will redirect to the retailer website through the Skimlinks’ network. When a reader clicks on a link, Skimlinks will identify which page the click came from and assign it a randomly generated number or Associate ID. This is communicated to the retailer and associated with any subsequent purchase.\nSkimlinks or Amazon then reconcile the list of clicks from links on the Guardian with purchases on the retailer’s site. This is used in order to calculate the commission.\nWe do not drop third or first party cookies, or otherwise access local storage through our affiliate links.

    "raw_text": "Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko were involved in a heated exchange at the end of their second-round match on Wednesday at the US Open.\nThe two met at the net for post-match handshakes after Townsend had completed a 7-5, 6-1 victory. But instead of heading to the locker rooms, they exchanged words and Ostapenko wagged her finger at her American opponent. The home crowd appeared to get behind Townsend and she approached the stands spurring them on as the noise rose on Court 11.\nAfter the match, Ostapenko said in an Instagram story that she had been unhappy with Townsend’s conduct before and during her victory.\n“Today after the match I told my opponent that she was very disrespectful as she had a net ball in a very deciding [moment] and didn’t say [sorry], but her answer was that she doesn’t have to say sorry at all,” Ostapenko said. “There are some rules in tennis which most of the players follow and it was first time ever that this happened to me on tour. If she plays in her homeland it doesn’t mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.”\nShe added: “In the beginning of the match all players are supposed to start warm up on the baseline. The opponent came out and straight away started the warm up [at the net] which is very disrespectful and against the rules of a tennis match.”\nFor her part, Townsend said Ostapenko had insulted her at the post-match handshake. “She told me I have no class, no education, and to see what happens when we get outside the US,” Townsend said. “I’m looking forward to it. I beat her in Canada outside the US. So let’s see what else she has to say.”\nTownsend, a world No 1 in doubles but currently ranked outside the top 100 in singles, suggested the No 25 seed Ostapenko was angry at the upset. “I mean, it’s competition,” Townsend said. “People get upset when they lose.”\nIn her post-match press conference Townsend, who is Black, would not be drawn on whether there was a racial component to Ostapenko’s comments.\n“That’s something you’re going to have to ask her,” said Townsend. “I didn’t take it in that way but also that has been a stigma in [the Black] community of being not educated ... when it’s the furthest thing from the truth. So whether it had racial undertones or not, that’s something she can speak on. The only thing that I’m worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.”\nOstapenko later denied any allegations of racism. “I was NEVER racist in my life and I respect all nations of people in the world. For me it doesn’t matter where you come from,” she said in a social media post. She also wrote about “how many messages I received that I am a racist.”\nOstapenko, the 2017 French Open champion, has riled opponents in the past. At Wimbledon in 2021, Ajla Tomljanovic accused the Latvian of pretending to be injured when she requested a medical timeout. Ostapenko went on to call the Australian “the worst player on tour”.\nTownsend will play No 5 seed Mirra Andreeva in the third-round."

    "raw_text": "Carlos Alcaraz thought the biggest challenge he would face in the early stages of this year’s US Open was the 145mph serves of his 6ft 11in first round opponent, Reilly Opelka. Instead it turned out to be his own brother.\nAlcaraz wanted a haircut before the tournament and, in the absence of his usual barber, Victor Martínez, asked one of his brothers to give him a trim. It did not go well.\n“I felt like my hair was really long already, and before the tournament I just really wanted to get a haircut,” the world No 2 told reporters after dismissing Opelka 6-4, 7-5 6-4 on Monday night. “Suddenly just my brother just – he misunderstood with the machine. He just cut it. Then, the only way to fix it was just to shave it off. To be honest, it’s not that bad, I guess.”\nAlcaraz has flown Martínez to other tournaments, such as this year’s French Open, when he needs a haircut but felt the flight from Spain to New York was too far. So far, the verdict on his brother’s barber skills are mixed.\n“Some people like it, some people don’t like it,” he said. “To be honest, I’m just laughing about the reaction of the people. It is what it is. I can’t do anything else right now, so I’m just laughing about everything they are saying about my haircut.”\nOne person who is not a fan is Frances Tiafoe. The pair could meet in the semi-finals after they won their first-round matches. Tiafoe described Alcaraz’s new cut as “horrendous” when asked about it.\n“I don’t know who told him to do that, but it’s terrible. From a guy who gets haircuts week in, week out, who prides himself on good haircuts, it’s horrendous,” Tiafoe said. “But at the end of the day, it’s Carlos, and that’s my guy. But yeah, he needs to get with me. He needs to get with me for sure.”\nAlcaraz had his own thoughts. “Frances is lying. Frances is lying,” laughed Alcaraz. “No, come on? He showed up here saying that it is terrible? I know he’s lying. I know he likes the haircut. He likes it. He told me.”\nThere were fans of the Spaniard’s new look though. Masters champion Rory McIlroy met Alcaraz at Flushing Meadows on Monday and gave his verdict. “I like it,” he said. “It’s good. It’s a good look.”\nAlcaraz, whose five grand slam titles include the 2022 US Open, next plays on Thursday, against world No 65 Mattia Bellucci. He said his hair grows so fast it may not be a talking point by then.\n“Every time that I get a haircut, in two or three days it’s gone,” he said. “In three days you’re going to see another hair[style].”"

    "raw_text": "When tennis star Fred Perry launched his polo shirt in the 1950s, it was designed to be worn on court. Little did he think it would become part of British cultural history, yet over the decades it has been worn by everyone from mods to ska fans, fashionistas and pop stars.\n“So many people have worn the Fred Perry shirt,” says Dominique Fenn, the company’s brand editor. “Sometimes, when you go to a gig, it’s not just the people on stage wearing it, it’s the roadies, it’s the guy behind the bar, it’s the crowd. In my first couple of weeks at Fred Perry, we did a live gig with the Specials, and, honestly, I felt like I’d joined a cult. It was that bizarre.”\nNext month, the laurel wreath-logoed polo shirt celebrates its 70th anniversary with a new exhibition, Fred Perry: A British Icon, at the Design Museum. As the exhibition demonstrates, such popularity is not restricted to Specials gigs – or even to music. “You’re equally likely to see a grime artist wearing it as you are someone into 1960s R&B or indie music, as well as across the football terraces,” says Liza Betts, a lecturer at London College of Fashion, UAL. Betts adds: “It works across generations. My 80-year-old dad wears it, as does my teenage daughter and her friends.”\nSimple design belies the shirt’s complex history. “It’s been appropriated and re-appropriated and rejected and appropriated again,” says Betts, “and at each point, its mythology gains more traction. Each generation, it gets taken up by somebody who is a symbol of cool – Paul Weller, Amy Winehouse, Arctic Monkeys, and it speaks to new people and gets adopted again.”\nIt wasn’t the first, or only, polo shirt with a cool logo – the French tennis player René Lacoste launched his version in 1933, and the American fashion designer Ralph Lauren in 1972. So what did Perry, the three-times Wimbledon champion, bring to the style when he launched it in 1952?\nFirst, there’s the logo, the symbol of victory – “a kind of branding that allows the consumer to reinterpret that meaning within their own lives”, says Maria McLintock, the exhibition’s curator – whether you’re “playing tennis, headlining a festival, attending a gig, or going to a job interview”.\nPerry’s own victories – his eight grand-slam wins make him the most successful British tennis player of all time – were all the more impressive given that he was self-taught. As the son of a Stockport factory worker turned Labour MP, “he wasn’t from a middle-class or wealthy background”, says Betts, “and yet he managed to become very successful in a sport that has a very particular kind of class dynamic. So there’s a mythology around that, too.” (That he dated several Hollywood stars, including Marlene Dietrich and Jean Harlow, can’t harm the brand message either.)\nIt was that “working class made good” spirit, as Betts puts it, that appealed to the 1960s mods. These young, white working-class men wore the shirt buttoned up to the top, with tight jeans and boots, to which was soon added the skinhead haircut. “The Fred Perry shirt fits the mod brief of ‘clean living under difficult circumstances’ perfectly,” says Betts. “It looks smart and neat, but it’s affordable, it’s achievable.”\nMcLintock says she “dug and dug” to uncover when the mods first adopted the top: “The Flamingo club in Soho was around the corner from Fred Perry’s first head office. The legend goes that a group of mods broke in, stole some polo shirts, and distributed them among their group. And the rest is history.”\nThe association with football culture began, according to McLintock, when a West Ham fan asked sports retailer Lillywhites – which stocked the white top – to design a white, maroon and ice-blue shirt. “That’s when it became a canvas for multiple colour combinations,” she says.\nOf course, such apparently universal appeal can’t guarantee entirely positive endorsements. Since the 1960s, the Fred Perry polo has had less desirable associations, when some skinheads moved over to neo-fascist groups such as the National Front, and more recently with violent far-right groups such as the Proud Boys in North America.\nIn 2020, Fred Perry pulled the black and yellow colourway – the Proud Boys adopted uniform – from the continent, releasing a statement that it stood for “inclusivity, diversity and independence”.\nThe brand, still British-based but Japanese-owned after Perry’s son David sold it in 1995 (the year his father died), has worked hard to diversify its image, “pushing and working closely with musicians for two decades”, says McLintock. Collaborations with artists and fashion designers have included Amy Winehouse, Gorillaz, Gwen Stefani, Comme des Garçons, Charles Jeffrey and Raf Simons.\nSeventy years on, what does the Fred Perry shirt mean now? Is it still a political statement? “It’s synonymous with the idea of resistance, so for many it will have political resonance,” says Betts. “Yet equally, it doesn’t mean anything in itself. It’s the context of its use that creates the meaning.” Betts cautions that just as the black and yellow version came to represent far-right extremism, there is a “secret language” coded into the various colour combinations: “They’re loaded symbols that affiliate you in one way or another, which not everyone is aware of.”\nUltimately, this smart yet casual top is a highly adaptable blank canvas. “You wear it to stand out, you wear it to fit in,” says Fenn. “I honestly don’t know any other brand that has that.”\nAnd yet, she adds: “If you think about it, it’s just a polo shirt.”"

    "raw_text": "Before the French tennis star Suzanne Lenglen boarded an ocean liner in 1926 to take her to New York (where she would embark on the lucrative tour of the US that arguably established tennis as a profession), she was asked about her level of fitness.\n“I don’t know,” she replied. “I haven’t played for months.” Instead, she said, she had been shopping. “You should see this black and white evening dress of mine. It’s a masterpiece.”\nIt was a response typical of the glamorous Lenglen, after whom the second largest court at the French Open’s Stade Roland Garros is named. A court which, over the past week, has seen drama as American Taylor Fritz returned the goading of a raucous crowd, and where the surprise finalist Karolina Muchova played.\nLenglen, known as La Divine, was the world’s first global sporting celebrity, her fame eclipsing that of even baseball’s Babe Ruth or boxing’s Jack Dempsey. During seven years as the world No 1, she won the singles title at Wimbledon six times, did the “triple” at the French Championships twice (singles, doubles and mixed doubles), took gold at the 1920 Olympics, and lost just a single match throughout her short post-first world war career (she retired from the match with illness, controversially).\nBut Lenglen, who was born in Paris in 1899 and spent her summers on the French Riviera where she honed her skills under the tutelage of her often-tyrannical father, did not conquer the world solely by her athletic ability (although Debussy did compose a ballet influenced by her prowess). Her charisma, unorthodox charm and hedonism helped keep her in gossip columns, but it was her sense of style that had an impact as great as her on-court talent and epoch-making career path.\nIn an era in which women’s sporting “costumes” were cumbersome and restrictive in the name of modesty, Lenglen dispensed with corsets and petticoats. The first Wimbledon fashion scandal – of which there have been many owing to the All England Club’s vigorous sartorial rules – saw Lenglen arriving for her 1919 debut in a low-cut dress and rolled-down stockings; an outfit the London press deemed “indecent”.\nThough she had worn a floppy hat on that occasion, Lenglen would introduce her signature garment not long after: the much emulated bandeau headscarf. Lenglen’s original take saw her wrap two yards of colourful silk chiffon around her neat flapper’s bob. Sometimes the bandeau would be polka dot, or adorned with diamonds; at other times, she colour-coded it to whichever round she was playing: orange for first, crimson for second.\nShe wore fur coats and ermine stoles to matches, and would sip cognac with bright red painted lips during changeovers. Her short-sleeved dresses gave way to sleeveless. The result: a deep tan she popularised even before Coco Chanel’s 1923 yacht trip. In collaboration with the Parisian courtier Jean Patou, whose muse she served as and who dressed her on and off the court, Lenglen was the poster girl for an avant garde sports casual style. The look became de rigueur in the 20th century for the upper classes, before being democratised, and is commonplace today (as well as presaging athleisure, though I refuse to blame Lenglen for Lululemon).\nPatou, dubbed the “most elegant man in Europe”, later dressed Lenglen in a freeing, calf-length pleated skirt in which to play, a garment that crossed into everyday wear.\nLenglen’s influence on the shifting status of tanned skin saw a renaissance in the design of swimsuits, which exposed greater and greater amounts of skin. Her trademark white plimsolls inspired unisex “Lenglen shoe” spin-offs – a precursor to the Adidas Stan Smith – which retailers called “light, elegant, and practical”. The female form was becoming liberated. The British tailor John Redfern was perhaps the first to design sports-specific wear for women in the 1870s, but it was Patou and Lenglen and the more androgynous, comfortable fits of Coco Chanel, in particular, that saw it take hold.\nPerhaps thanks to aristocratic and wealth-adjacent roots like Lenglen’s, tennis has always been the sport closest to fashion, whether haute or pret-a-porter. But nowadays, mid-range labels of past celebrated players such as Fred Perry and Rene Lacoste (Lenglen’s close friend ) are long established, and not a single style blog circa 2015 was complete without Stan Smiths. Emma Raducanu might have signed deals with high-end brands such as Dior, and Rolex has a collection with Roger Federer, but Bjorn Borg has a range of underpants, and Rafa Nadal’s Nike gear is stocked in Sports Direct.\nTennis is still by far the most stylish sport, in my opinion (with cricket taking second place – no disrespect to Premier League footballers dressed head-to-toe in DSquared2). I feel the umpires in tailored blazers and chinos at Roland Garros are clear evidence of this; those who worked the Suzanne Lenglen court participating in a homage to an inspiration both inside and outside the lines.\nRemember that every time you see progress in the utility of women’s sportswear we have Lenglen and Patou to thank, just as every time you are shoulder-robing a cashmere cardigan, being peak chic, you should pay your dues to them, too. Game, set, Matches."

    "raw_text": "It’s almost too good to be true. Could cinema be witnessing the birth of a stunning new mixed doubles partnership? Last year, Korean-Canadian film-maker Celine Song gave us her wonderful, Oscar-nominated debut film Past Lives, a personal love-triangle movie about a South Korean woman in the US, married to a white American writer, poignantly reconnecting with her Korean childhood sweetheart; the fictional writer, incidentally, has a novel out called Boner. Now Song’s actual white American husband Justin Kuritzkes has written this love-triangle movie, an uproarious screwball dramedy of straight sex and queer tennis: one player, incidentally, is renowned for his large penis.\nSome day, film school courses will be devoted to parallel-textual analyses of these two films, and maybe the legendary third wheel will come forward with a screenplay satirising sexual stereotypes, about a woman and a man who create a sensitive drama and a macho comedy from the same situation. Challengers is terrifically absorbing and funny, with zinging extended dialogue rallies – though its cop-out ending fudges what we all know about tennis. Like life, it’s a brutal zero-sum game of winners and losers.\nLuca Guadagnino directs with style and Zendaya is devastatingly cool as Tashi, a former superstar tennis player turned coach, now married to her single client: Art, played by Mike Faist, whose sensitive, open, boyish face registers the unfamiliar and disagreeable sensation of losing. He is way off his game these days, going out to patently inferior players, and Faist shows how he is perhaps getting tired of the tennis circuit, while glumly sensing that his wife finds this losing streak a serious turnoff. But fiercely focused Tashi comes up with a plan which Art timidly accepts: he will slum it on the inferior ATP Challenger Tour to match with some no-hoper whom he can crush. The taste of winning will get his groove back.\nBut to his horror – and a more ambiguous emotion from Tashi – Art is matched with his former best friend and Tashi’s ex-boyfriend Patrick, a louchely handsome performance from Josh O’Connor. Patrick has fallen on hard times, sleeping in his car and touring the cheaper circuits, but he has still got the talent. Maybe trouncing Art will impress Tashi, with whom he is, of course, still deeply in love.\nOr maybe it’s Art with whom he is still deeply in love. The course of their triangular romance and all its painful, fateful rows and infidelities are cleverly laid out in an exhilarating series of flashbacks and flashforwards, their past lives revealed in sudden hairstyle changes and clothing shifts, with Art and Patrick starting out as gormless teen chumps dazzled by Tashi, and growing near middle age … still dazzled by Tashi, who is charismatic at any age. The tennis itself is very convincingly dramatised and our three heroes really do look as if they are hitting the ball for real.\nThis is not the rather diffident stroke-play of Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany in the quaint, but in some ways comparable, tennis movie Wimbledon from 2004, though the gamesmanship and toxic masculinity reminded me pleasantly of Ian Carmichael and Terry-Thomas trying to impress Janette Scott during the famous tennis scene in the 1960 British classic School for Scoundrels. (Although Scott never encouraged Carmichael and Thomas to snog, while in their hotel room for a three-way.)\nMoment by moment, line by line and scene by scene, Challengers delivers sexiness and laughs, intrigue and resentment, and Guadagnino’s signature is there in the intensity, the closeups and the music stabs.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "On a mild evening in early spring, an unassuming street in Brooklyn momentarily became the destination for New York’s fashion crowd. Club kids, streetwear aficionados and people dressed like Neo from The Matrix vied for a spot in the swelling crowd. The reason? A fashion label called Luar, which has become so hyped in recent years that even those not usually accustomed to queueing will gladly get in line.\nIt was worth it. Once inside, the show felt like a party, with Tony award-nominated playwright Jeremy O.Harris and rapper A$AP Ferg in attendance, cheers coming from the usually po-faced audience with each model, and classy and clever takes on evening wear and suitable for work suiting on the catwalk. It then – seamlessly – turned into an actual party, the kind with drinks on trays.\nLuar’s designer, Raul Lopez, speaking a few weeks after the show, is wide-eyed but smiling when told about the scrum to get in. “It’s become a thing where it’s like getting into a club,” he says, speaking to the Guardian via video call from his grandmother’s house. “The kids start to leak it on TikTok or whatever … and like 700 or 800 people show up.”\nThose numbers are testament to how Luar is a name known way beyond those in the rarified world of fashion. This is perhaps partly because Lopez – a queer designer of colour who grew up in a non-gentrified area of New York – stands out from the industry he operates in. Rather than obscure these differences, Luar leans into them and celebrates them – constructing something radical: a luxury label that has appeal beyond the 1%.\nIf, in the fashion world, New York has long been shorthand for the uptown polish of labels such as Michael Kors and Ralph Lauren, Lopez’s Luar is one of a number of labels finally showing different points of view in this most diverse of cities. Other names include Willy Chavarria, the 56-year-old designer who works for Calvin Klein and is enjoying something of a resurgence of interest, thanks to his genderless designs and diverse street casting. And Head of State, the label founded by Taofeek Abijako when he was 17. His collection in February was a moving tribute to his father’s journey from Nigeria to Spain and finally the US.\nNotably, Lopez closed fashion week – a prestigious slot usually reserved for a household name. He sees this as an affirmation. “I was born and raised in New York, [and] coming from these disturbed neighbourhoods … to be able to display my work for the world and for New York, it was an honour,” he says. “In a weird way, it wasn’t really about me, it was about everybody. It’s like ‘I can do this, you can do this too, you know, you just got to hustle.’”\nThere are other signs of success. He is one of nine finalists up for this year’s prestigious LVMH prize for young designers, with the winner announced in June. He was also awarded the CDFA accessories designer of the year in 2022. And sales are growing – with the Ana bag key to this meteoric rise. The first drop, in October 2021, sold out within 30 minutes, and according to Vogue Business, sales for the brand increased 140% from spring/summer 2022 to spring/summer 2023.\nLaunched in 2021, the classic square shape with a looped round handle has become a favourite of celebrities including Dua Lipa, Troye Sivan and (delightfully) Patti LaBelle, but also regular folk. This is partly because of its price tag – the largest is $395 (£315). That might sound expensive – and it is – but compare that to other catwalk brands and it becomes relatively affordable in the world of luxury; a Louis Vuitton Speedy will set you back £1,310, for example, while a Chanel 2.55 is £8,530.\nLopez says this was intentional – it’s the kind of purchase someone can feasibly save up for (and they do – all but one of the designs are sold out online, and there are enthusiastic unboxing videos on TikTok). “I wanted to make a bag that I could afford when I was coming up,” he says. He says he sees people carrying the bag regularly. “I could be in one of those posh restaurants in London and then go to Brixton and a girl has that on there, too,” he says. “And it’s the same thing in Japan. I get pictures all the time. It’s pretty iconic. She [Ana] has a world of her own.”\nHe elaborates on how the design is a tribute to his family, who immigrated from the Dominican Republic in the mid-80s. “The handle was a homage to my grandmother and a nod to the Mod era,” explains Lopez. “And the shape was a nod to my mom. It’s like a briefcase … when immigrants came here, what they thought American luxury was, it was to have a briefcase. It’s a stamp of approval that you’re doing [well] even though you’re dirt poor. My dad had a briefcase in the house, and my mom had the small briefcase.” Is it a symbol of success? “100%. That’s what they were using it for, it was to fit into that world.”\nThe son of a construction worker and a factory seamstress, Lopez’s family and upbringing in the Dominican community are central to his designs, but also his lifestyle. He grew up in Williamsburg, long before the area was gentrified to the point of parody, and still lives in the same building in which he spent his childhood (although his parents have since moved to Long Island).\nHis mother and aunts showed him the power of clothes. “They were trying to emulate the American luxury they were seeing and to copy, paste – like a Latina Elizabeth Taylor or something,” he says. “But [they were] living in this dump. And to me, it was so beautiful. They were putting on these clothes to walk around these crack-infested neighbourhoods.”\nIf Lopez’s relatives are one type of family that he draws on, there’s also his community of other young queer men of colour, who came up together in New York in the early 00s. The models in his shows are often women Lopez knows from the ballroom scene, the diverse LGBTQ+ subculture as captured in Pose and Paris Is Burning. This is also where he met Telfar Clemens, the man behind the label Telfar, who Lopez calls his “best friend”. The two are often compared – partly because Telfar’s bag is also another so-called accessible status accessory, with the biggest of his shopping totes selling for £211 (it has been dubbed the “Brooklyn Birkin”). Lopez has a note of impatience when asked about the comparison. “It’s like, why are they comparing us? Do they compare a Prada bag to a Fendi bag?”\nAny narrative that they are competitors rather than friends is far from the case. “[Clemens] was always like ‘you need to do accessory’, he pushed and pushed,” says Lopez. “When I did my first drop [of the Ana] … he came and picked me up, popping bottles of champagne. We went to dinner to celebrate. They can’t break our bond.” Lopez says Clemens buys the Ana as presents for his relatives, rather than giving them his own bags.\nLopez is already fairly established in the fashion industry, beginning the label Hood By Air (HBA) with fellow designer Shayne Oliver (who he also met on the ballroom scene) in 2005, when Lopez was 17. If New York fashion at the time was pretty frilly dresses or work-ready shifts, Oliver and Lopez brought club culture, men in skirts and oversized logos to the catwalk long before other designers explored these themes. “We changed the game,” says Lopez now. “It took me a long time to be able to say that. I never gave myself my flowers.”\nLopez left HBA (without any conflict, he says) in 2010 and worked on various projects until Luar Zepol – a semordnilap of his name, later shortened to Luar – first began in 2017. But, after 12 years on the hamster wheel of fashion, the designer was reaching breaking point. “I was depressed and tired and exhausted, my mental health was all over the place,” he says. “Right after my show in 2019 I stopped completely and I disappeared into the Cayman Islands [he worked as a consultant to a hotel] and hid out down there for a year and a half.”\nHe says this retreat came from a realisation. “I never took a break since I left HBA. It was always go, go, go, go, go because even when I was stopping, I was still doing consulting. I was still working, trying to make money. It took a toll on me,” he says. “I’m always [the one] saying ‘oh, depression, anxiety. That’s crap, just snap out of it’. I didn’t know that I was actually depressed and had anxiety and my mental health was going through the sky.”\nWhile he was concerned time out from the industry would mean fashion would move on, it actually proved to be the galvanising moment. “When I came back in 2021 I already had a business plan,” he says. “I figured out how to make my brand successful – not just make clothing to please my friends, the art world and the fashion girls.” As his Instagram bio semi-jokes, philanthropy is next. “I’m just trying to figure out a way I can give back to the people who helped me and who inspire me,” he says “Like trans housing organisations, immigrants. I would like to do different colourways [of the Ana] and the money would just go to organisations. I’m not rich but I don’t care. I’ve lived a life of privilege and I still do. I don’t care about the money.”\nThe Ana, meanwhile, has her own story. “Seeing my bag all around the world is beautiful,” he says. “I walked into a hotel and saw this woman and her mad crocodile Birkin and then she has my bag across her body. You go to Bushwick [a Brooklyn neighbourhood] and you see it [too]. That’s the world of Luar.”"

    "raw_text": "After a year of musical chairs in the fashion industry, September is poised to be one of its biggest show months ever, with debut collections from 15 creative directors.\nRather than waiting for the catwalk, over the past 10 days brands including Chanel and Dior have given themselves a head start at the Venice film festival, using its starry red carpets and even gondolas to soft launch looks from their newly installed designers.\nUnlike the Oscars, which is one night of intense red-carpet scrutiny, or the Cannes film festival, which comes with strict rules, the focus at Venice is very much on notable art house films.\nWith the pressure off, it allows designers, stylists and their Hollywood clients the opportunity to have a bit more fun. Amanda Seyfried even borrowed the same Versace look from Julia Roberts. A triumph for sustainability or a marketing stunt? Either way, it was front-page news.\nJonathan Anderson, who took over at Dior in June, teased more than a dozen looks on actors including Greta Lee and Alba Rohrwacher before his womenswear debut in Paris next month. Lee wore a deconstructed minidress that riffed on the brand’s signature bar jacket, while Rohrwacher wore a navy gown with a padded bustle.\nMeanwhile, Tilda Swinton hinted at what we can expect from Matthieu Blazy, the French-Belgian designer who recently landed the top job at Chanel, when she stepped off a water taxi wearing loosely cut white trousers and a short-sleeved blouse featuring tiny shimmering interlocking CC buttons.\nHenrik Lischke, the senior fashion features editor at Grazia, likens this new preview strategy to the press tour of the Barbie film in 2023. “That proved that the more hype you create, the more attention you get. These fashion brands are giving us a glimpse of what to expect,” he said. “It gets people excited long before a look even hits the catwalk.”\nIt can also catapult relatively unknown names into the spotlight. In April, when it was announced Dario Vitale would be taking over from Donatella Versace, he was a designer only industry insiders were familiar with. But this week he was the talk of the lido, thanks to that sneak peek via Roberts and Seyfried.\nPop stars such as Taylor Swift are known for planting Easter eggs, hidden clues about future projects for fans to decipher. Paparazzi shots of actors on set are used as unofficial teasers. And now it appears fashion designers are embracing the art of the promotional sneak peek too.\nFashion’s new soft launch was first embraced by the actor Timothée Chalamet, who wore Haider Ackermann’s first outfit for Tom Ford to the Golden Globes, two months before the designer’s debut show. He also wore Sarah Burton’s first menswear look for Givenchy, a butter-yellow suit, to the Oscars days before her inaugural Paris show. Vicky Krieps and Julianne Moore have also worn previews of Louise Trotter’s Bottega Veneta.\nBut similar to how on-set images have been blamed for ruining movie magic, could these early teasers backfire? Some online users have accused Versace of becoming boring, while others say Anderson’s purposefully chaotic pieces for Dior do not exactly scream Hollywood glamour.\nAmy Odell, a fashion commentator and author of Gwyneth: The Biography, says while designers will be aware of early criticism, it is important to remember “not every look is for everybody”. As for disclosing too much, Odell is not worried. “I don’t think a whole lot is given away by one or two looks at a film festival – I view it as a nice teaser of what’s to come, an amuse bouche versus a big spoiler.”\nBest looks\nWhen the Hollywood stylist Elizabeth Saltzman posted a photo of Julia Roberts in a striped shirt, straight jeans and blazer from Versace on her Instagram account, Seyfried gushed: “Please let me wear the same outfit.” Two days later, Saltzman granted her wish, thanking Roberts for her “generosity and sustainability. Sharing is caring!” as she posted a photo of Seyfried in the same look, albeit with different shoes. Roberts wore brown leather heels; Seyfried chose strappy sandals.\nThe internet was quick to chime in, placing photos of the stars side by side and debating who wore it best. Some are even calling it the most memorable look of the festival. But while it has cemented the idea of the BJT (blazer, jeans, top) as a form of modern power dressing (see the front row and the “girl boss” portrait era), it wasn’t the festival’s greatest red carpet hit. Here are three looks I would have borrowed instead.\nAyo Edebiri in Chanel\nFor her Venice debut, rather than going for a classic red carpet dress, Ayo Edebiri chose a white two-piece from Chanel. It hints at the direction Blazy wants to take the house. He was the designer who masterminded Bottega Veneta’s trompe l’œil pieces, including flannel shirts and jeans that were made from leather. Edebiri’s look riffs on Chanel’s spring 1999 collection, which featured asymmetrical jackets and cuffed trousers. It instantly feels more relatable than a tulle gown, although who but a Hollywood star can realistically wear an all-white look without the fear of spilling their lunch down themselves.\nJacob Elordi in Bottega Veneta\nOK, so Jacob Elordi in an all-white look from Bottega Veneta isn’t exactly novel, but hey, it’s not a suit, which for a man on the red carpet is kind of a big deal. It also marks an end to method dressing, a painful red carpet trend where actors felt the need to reference their characters. Although, given that Elordi will next be seen in Emerald Fennell’s sexy adaptation of Wuthering Heights, I am now thinking those sideburns and that billowing shirt are in fact quite Heathcliff.\nGreta Lee in Dior\nDuring Anderson’s tenure at Loewe, Lee starred in numerous campaigns for the brand and was a regular on the front row. Now the Irish designer has hot-footed it to Dior, it seems Lee has followed. The Past Lives star has worn almost exclusively Dior throughout her stint at Venice. This look is Anderson’s take on the label’s new look – the silhouette that emerged during Christian Dior’s debut in 1947. For anyone bored with stunt dressing, it is a nice palette cleanser. I would have liked a more playful shoe – after all, Anderson created those broken egg Loewe heels and viral pigeon bag – but maybe the witty accessories will come during his official hard launch at Paris fashion week next month."

    "raw_text": "Not for the first time, organisers of the Cannes film festival, the ritziest and most photographed in the industry’s calendar, have decreed that various outfits will not be allowed on the red carpet this year.\nAn official statement released earlier this week stated that for “decency reasons” there will be “no naked dressing” – and no oversized outfits either – “in particular those with a large train that hinder the proper flow of traffic of guests and complicate seating in the theatre”.\nEncouraged instead are cocktail and black dresses, and – perhaps with US guests in mind – “a dark-coloured pantsuit”. After some back and forth over high-heeled shoes in recent years, anything goes, as long as they are “elegant”. As for the men, it’s simply tuxedos or dark suits.\nWhile the rules only apply to those attending evening screenings at the Grand Théâtre Lumière, five days into the 12-day festival, it became clear that the memo had not reached every suite at the Carlton. Halle Berry, Eva Longoria and Heidi Klum all arrived wearing gowns of some girth, while a handful of lesser known names – Miss Universe 2016, Iris Mittenaere, the makeup artist Meredith Duxbury and the actor Blanca Blanco – revealed a bounty of flesh that arguably broke the code. As for the men, Jeremy Strong, a member of the jury, flouted rules by wearing a hot peach tux.\nBarely there gowns have been titillating Cannes since the 1970s. Blame the weather or fashion or both, but who could forget Jane Birkin’s hip-slit gown in 1974, or 2024 when Bella Hadid flashed her nipples in a Saint Laurent gown in sheer chocolate organza. Or indeed Madonna, who wore Jean Paul Gaultier underwear in 1991.\nFor a trend that carries an awful lot of subtext for something that involves very little material, it has become a lightning rod over the continued policing of women’s bodies in the public sphere. “If fashion can be a mechanism of social control, it also offers a means of transgression and empowerment,” writes Einav Rabinovitch-Fox in Dressed for Freedom, which claims, among other things, that women have the right to reclaim their own sexuality through sexy clothes.\nNatasha Walter, the feminist and author of Living Dolls, is not a fan of the whole naked trend, which she says “bolsters objectification and hyper-sexualisation of women in the public eye”. But equally, she feels banning it is counterproductive. “It’s like school uniforms for girls. The tiny skirt becomes an act of rebellion.”\nThe diktat has been seen wildly at odds with the festival itself, which has little or no rules about the amount of nudity on screen, and suggests that while it is acceptable for women to strip off for the sake of art, when it comes to doing the same thing on her own terms, it somehow contravenes good taste. Also: what about the men?\n“It does feel like a backward step,” says Walter. Concern that the red carpet might divert attention away from the film is also at odds with its very existence, which is primarily as a photo call. “We are in a cultural moment where we talk about freedom but what you get is that it falls back into what looks suspiciously like objectification.”\nWalter says that while there are lots of actors who do not buy into the fashion side of things – and therefore do not get our attention – speaking more broadly, “there is an uncertainty about how women should be seen in the public eye” and that regulations over what they wear is simply “another push towards the conservative”.\nMore straightforwardly controversial is the rule surrounding big dresses. “Saying what [women] can’t do won’t solve the issue [because it] suggests that the only way women can get our attention is by wearing huge clothes,” Walter says. It simply boosts the idea that “women are not appreciated for their talent so they feel the need to take up space in other ways”.\nWho tested the new rules?\nHeidi Klum\nNo one knows why the former Victoria’s Secret Angel, reality fashion competition host and model-who-once-dressed-as-a-7ft-worm-for-Halloween goes to Cannes, but we are where we are. Here she is in a pink organza-tripping hazard of a gown by Elie Saab, cut to mimic floral petals, which manages to partly flout the nudity ban too.\nTaking up space factor 9/10\nModesty factor 7/10\nHalle Berry\n“I’m not going to break the rules,” said jury member Halle Berry shortly before breaking said rules with a giant pink gingham and black choux-bun of a dress by the Greek designer Celia Kritharioti, which said trad wife upfront and divorcee at the back.\nTaking up space factor 8/10\nHofit Golan\nWhat if I told you The Real Housewives of Dubai star and three-time Forbes influencer of the year Hofit Golan’s back-corseted cape dress was actually a Vietnamese wedding dress?\nTaking up space factor 6/10\nJeremy Strong\nAnother delightfully unhinged take on formalwear – a peachy coloured Loro Piana tux – for the eldest boy on the jury, Jeremy Strong, who used his platform to criticise Trump’s planned tariffs on foreign film while wearing a £250,000 watch and a bare ankle. Ah Cannes, never change.\nModesty factor 9/10"

    "raw_text": "Long before the designer Jonathan Anderson stepped down from his role at Loewe in March, it was rumoured he would be heading for Dior. So when it was finally announced – six months after Dior’s menswear designer left, and four days after its womenswear head, Maria Grazia Chiuri, showed a collection in Rome – it surprised no one.\nYet Anderson’s newfound position at luxury’s centre of gravity still sets Dior, a grand fashion institution, careering down an experimental path. As Delphine Arnault, the chair and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture, told Vogue Business: “For any house, having new artistic direction can be a challenge.”\nA critical darling and commercial success, Anderson made Loewe into a fashion week hype machine and Hollywood powerhouse while creating shoes with perspex cracked eggs for heels, art-directing Daniel Craig’s post-Bond relaunch in specs and quirky knits, and casting the late Dame Maggie Smith as a model in an advertising campaign at the age of 88.\nAnderson’s role at Loewe was also lucrative. Since he took over, the brand’s annual revenues increased fivefold. With the move to Dior he will now probably become the most prolific designer in fashion; assuming he continues to work on his own brand (JW Anderson), as well as his collaboration with Uniqlo, it is expected he will show 18 collections a year.\nThe world of high fashion is a long way from Anderson’s early days in Northern Ireland. He was born in 1984 in Magherafelt, a town otherwise famous for cropping up in Seamus Heaney’s early work, and went to school during the Troubles. Raised Protestant, he has spoken in the past about passing through checkpoints on his way to school. “It does make you quite hard because emotionally you were toughened by that,” he recently told New York magazine.\nAnderson’s father, Willie, was captain of the Ireland rugby team, and something of a character; in 1980, he spent three months in an Argentinian prison for stealing the national flag from outside a government building while on tour. Anderson’s mother, Heather, was an English teacher. As parents, they were wholly supportive of his career. “You’ll do anything for your kid if you believe their dream is not something that’s beyond them,” said his father, adding that they “remortgaged the house to try and get him through certain points”.\nAnderson left home aged 18 to study acting in Washington DC, but changed his mind, returning home to work in the Dublin department store Brown Thomas. It was around this time he got into fashion, though he was turned down by every school he applied to except the London College of Fashion, which was piloting a new menswear course. He went on to launch his namesake brand JW Anderson in 2008. LVMH took a minority stake in the brand in 2013, and Anderson worked at Loewe from 2013 until spring this year.\nOne of a new raft of power designers to share an art-college enthusiasm for avant-garde projects, he was never a designer in the pure “cutting and draping” sense (though he completed his degree), relating more to Miuccia Prada, who studied political science before going into fashion.\nAnderson’s arrival at Dior is part of a changing of the guard at leading houses that in recent months has seen Chanel appoint the French-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy and Gucci sign the Georgian fashion designer Demna. Dior’s announcement is the latest move in a frenzied round of musical chairs at fashion’s top table, the impact of which will be seen at fashion weeks in the second half of 2025.\nAn immediate consequence of the recent personnel changes has been a rollback of female representation in fashion’s most prestigious roles.\nAnderson replaces Chiuri, Dior’s first female designer, who modernised the ladylike codes of the house while supporting and referencing a range of female artisans and artists. She became well-liked for attempting – however clumsily with her “We should all be feminists” T-shirts – to use her might and financial power to modernise feminism in fashion. With the exception of the appointments of two British female designers – Sarah Burton at Givenchy, and Louise Trotter, who replaces Blazy at Bottega Veneta – the incoming class of designers is overwhelmingly male.\nStill, as far as the male gaze is concerned, Anderson is well known for covering up the wearer’s body, albeit with anthuriums and deflated balloons as well as actual clothes. He created Rihanna’s bump-shaped red leather corset worn at the 2023 Super Bowl for an internet-breaking pregnancy reveal, and collaborated with the sculptor Lynda Benglis on a stage set that turned a Paris show space into a gallery. He also launched the most in-demand handbag of modern times, the Puzzle bag, and has dressed Beyoncé, Zendaya and Greta Lee.\nAnderson’s references have always come from outside the fashion world, namely craft, surrealism and cultural history (one JW Anderson show was inspired by Rasputin going skiing). As a result, the traditional narrative – in which young designers opt into commercial success by bending their taste toward the mainstream – has so far failed to apply in the case of Anderson, who has become more avant garde rather than less as his career has progressed.\nYet however esoteric his designs, Anderson’s appointment suggests the mega-conglomerate LVMH is valuing creativity over celebrity. As Arnault said: “I think this is going to be great for the maison. There will be consistency and coherence in the products, but also in terms of communication, I think our message will be much clearer.”\nThe idea is that Anderson will bring some of his own team and hopefully, his customers will follow suit. Whatever the hype surrounding his appointment, he is still tasked with turning around the fortunes of Dior, which saw sales decrease from €9.5bn in 2023 to €8.7bn in 2024, according to an HSBC estimate. But as Arnault has said: “It takes a few seasons to see exactly what the vision is. But I think he’s totally energised by the idea.”"

    "raw_text": "The most glamorous job hunt in fashion is over. Chanel has announced the appointment of the 40-year-old French-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy to the role of creative director, bringing to an end a six-month recruitment campaign during which almost every top tier name in fashion has been linked to the role.\nBlazy joins Chanel from Bottega Veneta, which has become an insider favourite during his three-year tenure. He previously held senior roles at Calvin Klein, Celine and Maison Margiela. Little known outside of the industry, he was considered an underdog in a field thought to have included Marc Jacobs, Jeremy Scott, Hedi Slimane, Simon Porte Jacquemus, Pieter Mulier of Azzedine Alaïa and Pierpaolo Piccioli, whose acclaimed run at Fendi ended recently.\nBlazy’s appointment offers a rare insight into strategy at Chanel, which is privately owned, famously secretive – and phenomenally successful. Global revenue reached $19.7bn in 2023, representing a 16% annual increase during a period when most of the luxury industry has suffered a slowdown.\nThe choice of Blazy suggests that the brand wants the Chanel name itself in headlines, rather than cede the limelight to a star designer. By choosing an insider favourite rather than a celebrity name, CEO Leena Nair has prioritised taste and design over showmanship and name recognition. Blazy is known for making clothes, not for marketing them. Chanel’s decision is a contrast to that of Louis Vuitton, who last year appointed Pharrell Williams, whose creative background is primarily in music rather than fashion, as chief menswear designer.\nChanel may be taking hints from the playbook of Hermes, the only brand whose handbags are considered more aspirational than Chanel by shoppers. The Hermes designer Nadège Vanhee has a low personal profile, with the brand’s main character energy channelled directly into its Birkin and Kelly bags. Had the Chanel creative director title been awarded to a designer with a pop-culture profile such as Slimane or Jacobs, it would have signalled a reprise of the Karl Lagerfeld era, when Chanel’s shows were mass entertainment rather than a luxury showcase. The continued rise of Chanel sales during the five years spent under the low-profile Virginie Viard may have emboldened Nair, and Chanel’s president of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, to take a risk on a lesser known name.\nThe job is the holy grail of fashion positions, not just for the salary (thought to be between $4 and $5m) but for the status. Chanel is a symbol of glamour and fashion that is recognised and valued, not only by the small number of consumers who can afford its tweed suits and leather handbags, but by those who save up for its iconic No 5 perfume or Rouge Noir nail polish. In the 114 years since Chanel was founded, only three designers – Viard, Lagerfeld and Coco herself – have previously sat in the hot seat.\nBlazy’s appointment will delight fashion insiders who prize his cerebral love of design, and passion for the craft of clothes. His first Milan fashion week outing for Bottega Veneta featured a trompe l’oeil look of jeans and check shirt, worn on the catwalk by Kate Moss, later revealed to be fine leather handpainted to pass as denim and flannel. His most recent Milan show was his most esoteric to date. Inspired by the scene in ET where the extra terrestrial hides among stuffed toys in a wardrobe, Blazy replaced chairs with individual animal-themed bean bags at his most recent Bottega Veneta show. (Actors Michelle Yeoh and Jacob Elordi were allocated on a ladybird and a bunny rabbit, respectively.) Dresses were trimmed with metal matchsticks, models’ faces concealed by fringed leather wigs. Some carried bouquets of lilies hand-knitted from brightly coloured wool, rather than handbags."

    "raw_text": "Michaela Merkas wasn’t going to miss seeing Margot Robbie in person.\nSince last year, she and friend Olivia Hooker have been obsessively following the increasingly lavish promotion for the upcoming Barbie movie – and now they’re crammed into a crowd in Sydney’s Pitt Street Mall, where the film’s stars Margot Robbie and America Ferrera are joining the first fan event of a global publicity tour.\nHooker has brought her own childhood Barbie doll and is clasping it tight. “I was so excited when I heard. I was like, ‘I have to go – whatever I have on that day, I don’t have any more, I’m going’,” she says.\n“It’s been hyped on socials for a very long time,” Merkas adds. “The sneak peeks of the rollerblading scene – that is iconic.”\nThe Barbie movie campaign has been a masterclass in marketing, creating an instant modern icon from one that was six-decades-old. Since the emergence of those first photos in June 2022 – Robbie and Ryan Gosling decked out in fluoro pink and yellow, rollerblading the Venice Beach boardwalk in what Robbie would later describe as “the most humiliating moment of my life” – the anticipation has been fever pitch.\nThere’s a lifesize Barbie Dreamhouse in Malibu you can attempt to win a night at; an Architectural Digest tour of the plastic fantastic set; and brand tie-ups from suitcases and Xbox controllers to electric toothbrushes and makeup. And, yes, you can even buy those rollerblades for $US289 – plus another $US99 for the knee, elbow and wrist protectors.\nIf the film itself contributed to a global shortage of pink paint, its promo team didn’t help.\nBarbie, which opens in Australia on 20 July and in the UK and US the following day, is expected be one of the biggest movies of the year. Directed and co-written by Lady Bird and Little Women’s Greta Gerwig, and starring Robbie, Gosling, Ferrera, Issa Rae and a teeming ensemble cast, the expectations are as stratospheric as Astronaut Barbie’s space station.\nOn Pitt Street Mall, the clamouring crowd is decked out in all shades of pink – magenta, fuchsia, cerise, rose, neon and the rest. There are months-old babies in pink beanies, older women with hot pink-striped scarves, and a person in a rainbow-coloured tulle mermaid skirt. The stars greet fans lined-up along the Mall, signing Barbie dolls in boxes and taking photos before ascending the stage for a Q&A; in a refreshing sartorial moment, Robbie takes a selfie with a man in a Slipknot hoodie.\nVincent Nardella wears a string of pearls, pink-rimmed sunglasses and a marbled salmon-pink top layered under his blush jacket.\n“Barbie was part of my childhood but one which was hidden,” he says. “I went to my sister’s room and played with her Barbie. To see that in real-life with this movie, it means a lot. It’s important to celebrate everyone and every type of person.”\nGerwig’s Barbie movie, produced through Robbie’s production company LuckyChap Entertainment, has been at pains to emphasise its inclusivity. The cast includes Barbies and Kens from all backgrounds and body types, with trans actor Hari Nef as Doctor Barbie.\nDuring a media event the day before at Sydney’s Bondi beach, Gerwig says the target audience for the film is anyone from eight to 108. “It’s a movie that I think can really cut across generations and genders. Everyone can find a pink, glittery existential dance party in their heart.”\nGerwig’s mother wasn’t a fan of Barbie – which only made her child-self more interested in the toy. “I had a lot of hand-me-down Barbies, so I got a lot of Barbies who were like Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie. They didn’t have shoes and their clothes were backwards.”\nAfter Robbie brought her on to the project, Gerwig went to Mattel headquarters, where the business opened up their archives for her.\n“They took me through everything from 1959 until now,” she says – a deep dive which compelled Gerwig to re-position what Barbie’s legacy means to fans today.\n“If there were rules, I think we broke all of them. That was part of the fun, in a way. Like, ‘Tell me what your sacred cows are and I will do something naughty with them’.”\nGerwig wanted to tap into the full gamut of emotions surrounding the Barbie brand, and all the different feelings – positive, negative and neutral – it evokes.\n“If you love Barbie, you’re going to love it, if you hate Barbie, you’re going to love it,” Robbie says. “But if you just like a good movie, you’re going to love it.”\nIn Sydney’s Pitt Street Mall, the fans are definitely primed to love it.\n“I have such a deep connection with Barbie,” says Hooker, still holding her doll. “I played with her as a kid and [continued] throughout high school. I was a bit judged for that but Barbie is coming back around. And it’s validating for me.”\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "For the first time in almost 50 years, Versace will no longer be designed by a Versace.\nThree decades after she started working for the company – and 27 years after she stepped into the role of creative director after the murder of her brother, Gianni – the designer Donatella Versace has announced she is to step down from her role at the Italian brand from the end of March.\n“It has been the greatest honour of my life to carry on my brother Gianni’s legacy,” she said in a statement on Thursday morning. “He was the true genius, but I hope I have some of his spirit and tenacity.”\nFrom April, Dario Vitale, 41, a former image director at Miu Miu, the edgier sister brand to Prada, will be Versace’s creative director. Versace will not leave the company – instead she will become chief brand ambassador, looking after (among other roles) philanthropy and red carpet dressing. Of the new role, Donatella said: “I will remain Versace’s most passionate supporter. Versace is in my DNA and always in my heart.”\nVersace, the youngest and only daughter of a dressmaker in Reggio Calabria, was born in 1955, a decade after her eldest brother, Gianni. Though she left home to study in Florence, along with Santo, the middle brother who ran the business side, she was very much involved in the family business as a supporter and a muse to her brother. By 1989, aged 34, she began working at Atelier Versace, and by 1993 had sole creative responsibility for Versus, Versace’s cheaper diffusion line.\nIt was after the murder of Gianni in 1997 – the 50-year-old designer was shot outside his home in Miami Beach – that Donatella, unexpectedly, was propelled into the top job. Despite having no formal fashion training, she inherited a $807m (£623m) business and 130 shops worldwide. Talking about that time in the Guardian in 2017, she said: “For the first five years, I was lost … I made a lot of mistakes. I would tell myself … don’t try to be Gianni!”\nAt its height, under Gianni, Versace specialised in an aesthetic, synonymous with “flashion” and vulgarity and starry front rows. But with a knack for telling a story through the clothes themselves, Donatella became just as entwined with the look.\nOne of the few brands with a designer who is as much a visual ambassador of the clothes as the customer – not to mention one of the few women in a top job at a fashion house – Versace not only wore the brand, but became it. Instantly recognisable, in 2015 she even briefly appeared as the face of Givenchy.\nAlthough Versace’s status in popular culture rose on Gianni’s watch – he designed Liz Hurley’s safety-pin dress and choreographed the 1991 show in which the supermodels Naomi Campbell, Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista lip-synched to George Michael’s Freedom on the catwalk – it was consolidated by Donatella, who went on to work closely with Madonna and design, among other things, interiors, hotels and Jennifer Lopez’s plunging “jungle” dress worn to the Grammy’s in 2000. The outfit spawned so many search queries that Google was inspired to create what is now Google Images.\nDespite a few dips – Donatella has been vocal about her addictions and the company almost filed for bankruptcy in the early 2000s – she grew into the recognisable figurehead of the company, a champion for LGBTQ+ rights and a beloved character within the fashion industry.\nThe change in leadership marks not only a historic transition for the brand, but a financial one too. In the statement on Thursday, John D Idol, the chief executive officer of Capri Holdings which owns Versace as well as Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, called the decision “part of a thoughtful succession plan”.\nIt is also thought that the Prada group, which owns Miu Miu, wants to buy Versace and has an exclusive bidding window on the brand – and that Vitale will provide a new wave of energy. During his tenure at Miu Miu, the brand recorded a 58% increase in revenue, to €649m (£544m). Sales were up 93% last year.\nVitale is not a well known name in fashion. But he had been rumoured to be a contender for roles at Bottega Veneta and Gucci. In his own statement, thanking Donatella, he described his new position as “a privilege”."

    "raw_text": "Halle and Adrien mack on\nAt the 2003 Oscars, Adrien Brody – who had just become the youngest best actor winner for his turn in The Pianist – planted an unplanned kiss on Halle Berry, the award’s presenter. The moment has stirred controversy in recent years, but the pair warded off any untoward discourse by recreating their lip-locking stunt at this year’s ceremony. Berry greeted Brody on the red carpet with a warm embrace before the pair smooched for the cameras. “Tonight I had to pay him back,” Berry told Variety. “He deserved that.” The academy, meanwhile, called it “a reunion 22 years in the making”.\nConan v Karla\nIn the sharpest moment of a gloriously piquant opening monologue, Conan O’Brien addressed Karla Sofía Gascón, the Emilia Pérez lead and one-time frontrunner whose Oscars chances were scuppered after a series of damning tweets. Despite the backlash, Gascón still attended the ceremony – though she skipped the red carpet.\n“Anora has used the F-word 479 times, which beats the record of Karla Sofía Gascón’s publicist after seeing her tweets,” O’Brien cracked to raucous laughter in the room – before the camera cut to Gascón in the audience smiling and bowing. “If you tweet about the Oscars tonight,” O’Brien addressed Gascón, “my name is Jimmy Kimmel”.\nButtered up\nIs it butter? Is it Tweety Bird? Is it Laffy Taffy? No! It’s Timothée Chalamet in a flash of flaxen – a head-to-toe yellow leather suit accompanied by a yellow shirt. The comparisons came thick and fast. Was he auditioning for Curious George’s similarly svelte man in the yellow hat? Was he in camouflage as a lump of Lurpak? It turned out it was a Givenchy ensemble. “You will not get hit on your bike tonight,” O’Brien joked.\nWrong notes\nEmilia Pérez’s barnstormer El Mal was all but guaranteed best original song after a slew of other recent awards victories. What was less expected was the victory speech from songwriters Clément Ducol and Camille – who launched into a warbling a cappella performance of their track as director (and the song’s co-writer), Jacques Audiard, stood stiffly just behind the podium. Their rendition soared high into a completely silent audience; they bravely beat on, voices against the play-off music, borne back ceaselessly into the crowd.\nDance break\nWhen the ceremony cut to an ad break, audiences in the Dolby theatre were treated to a much-needed intermission – courtesy of Colman Domingo, best actor nominee for Sing Sing and Hollywood’s suavest leading man. During a lull in the proceedings, Domingo rallied the audience to their feet while the Maze funk classic Before I Let Go echoed through the room. He bounced on stage in a cherry-red tux and a drink in hand – and soon the crowd was on their feet. Domingo was also one of the few celebrities letting loose to Queen Latifah’s musical tribute to Quincy Jones. Dancing king.\nA flurry of firsts\nWhen Flow, a cat’s odyssey without dialogue, took home the award for best animated feature, it became the first Latvian film to win an Oscar. “Ball’s in your court, Estonia,” O’Brien joked – before making way for a whole bevy of milestones at this year’s ceremony. Paul Tazewell was the first Black man to win the best costume design Oscar (for his work on Wicked), while Zoe Saldaña said she was the first American of Dominican origin to win an Oscar. “I know I will not be the last,” Saldaña gushed on stage.\nWinning best documentary, No Other Land – a harrowing account of the destruction of villages in the West Bank – became the first Palestinian feature recognised by the academy, despite still lacking US distribution. In a stirring speech that roundly inveighed against the US government, the co-director (and new father) Basel Adra also dedicated the award to his daughter. “I hoped that she would not have to live the same life that I am living now,” he said.\nRead more about the 2025 Oscars:\n-\nAnora takes home best picture Oscar\n-\nAdrien Brody and Mikey Madison win best acting prizes\n-\nKieran Culkin and Zoe Saldaña win supporting awards\n-\nAnora’s Sean Baker wins for directing, editing and screenplay"

    "raw_text": "Nancy Meyers, the director of The Holiday and Something’s Got to Give, knows a thing or two about making movies. And this week, she took to Instagram to protest about a new trend in cinema and TV: on-set photos.\nScreenshotting leaked images of actor Jack Lowden dressed as Mr Darcy in Dolly Alderton’s adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, she wrote: “Can we please STOP showing movies and TV shows being made?! I’m closing my eyes. I don’t want to see Mr Darcy getting dressed!” Addressing the fan who originally posted the images, she added: “All the magic is going away! C’mon!”\nUnfortunately for Meyers, the removal of movie magic isn’t limited to Mr Darcy. Productions that have recently had on-set images shared online include The Devil Wears Prada 2, And Just Like That and American Love Story, the Ryan Murphy miniseries about Carolyn Bessette and John F Kennedy Jr.\nIf Sarah Jessica Parker’s JW Anderson pigeon bag spotted on the set of And Just Like That was a “moment”, Margot Robbie on rollerblades filming Barbie in 2023 perhaps cemented the phenomenon. These images spawned online chatter, news stories and memes long before the film hit the cinemas.\nThis year, the outfits worn on set by Sarah Pidgeon as Bessette Kennedy, were described as “fashion murder” on Instagram, and fashion is the common factor that links these productions – unlike, say, a thriller or a sci-fi film, what characters wear is central to the appeal. This month, images of The Devil Wears Prada 2 characters at a make-believe Met Gala have been pored over on social media.\nHenrik Lischke, senior fashion features editor at Grazia, says on-set images are popular with their readers. “Across social and online, the appetite for it is huge. They lend themselves to a variety of content. It’s about the outfits we’ve seen and loved, or these days the internet turns everything into memes.”\nFor The Devil Wears Prada 2, the ubiquity of the on-set photo itself was fodder for memes – with people screenshotting stars like Selena Gomez to Olivia Rodrigo with the caption “spotted filming scenes for The Devil Wears Prada 2 in New York”.\nAmy Odell, fashion commentator and author of a new biography of Gwyneth Paltrow, thinks the frenzy is down to a hunger for female-friendly fashion content in film and TV, which is not satisfied. “There is a dearth of this type of movie or TV show, and people want fashion-oriented things like And Just Like That. A lot of people are hate-watching that, and it’s not a very good show, but I’m going to be a little sad when it’s over … We haven’t had a fashiony show that’s about women’s relationships with one another [for a long time].”\nOdell says that while researching her book, people talked to her about “how, when [Paltrow] was filming Shakespeare in Love, efforts were made to remove cameras from the set because they didn’t want photos of her in costume to leak. I’m sure it was much easier to control then.”\nThese days “you’re going to see on TikTok, you’re going to see it on Instagram,” says Lischke. “Last September in New York, I was in the West Village and bumped into the And Just Like That set. It wasn’t just paparazzi. It was a huge crowd. I ended up filming it and sending it to my family.”\nIf this is a trend that suits the digital age, it’s not new, says Helen Warner, associate professor in media and digital cultures at the University of East Anglia: “There’s always been an appetite for this kind of material, from the beginnings of Hollywood and the popularity of the ‘film fan’ magazine.”\nShe says it is part of the way the industry has developed. “[Hollywood has] long since cultivated this kind of ‘parasocial’ relationship with film stars. This feeling of ‘knowing them’ has intensified thanks to the increasing accessibility of these kinds of images”.\nNeither Warner nor Odell believe on-set photos will mean fatigue by the time the final product reaches our screens. This bears out with the Barbie example – the film topped $1bn in box office sales.\nLischke, like Meyers, would like to keep the surprise for when he finally sits in the cinema seat. “[The Devil Wears Prada 2 team] will have to get more creative with the scenes that they don’t film out in the open so certain elements of surprises remain,” he says. He names Gia Coppola’s film The Last Showgirl as a good example of when this works, due to a plotline that wasn’t in the trailer. “You were surprised by something entirely new,” he says. “I hope that The Devil Wears Prada 2 is like that – that there are plot twists and outfits we haven’t seen.”"

    "raw_text": "Gwyneth: The Biography opens, where else, with the vaginal egg, an episode that has come to stand for Paltrow’s general ability to sell dumb ideas to credulous rich women using widespread mockery as her marketing rocket fuel. (In case you need a reminder: this was the $66 jade egg Paltrow sold via her lifestyle brand Goop that promised various health benefits upon insertion.) Amy Odell’s book, billed as delivering “insight and behind-the-scenes details of Paltrow’s relationships, family, friendships, iconic films”, as well as her creation of Goop, takes no particular stand on this, nor on many of Paltrow’s more divisive episodes, instead offering us what feels like an earnest jog back through the actor and wellness guru’s years of fame. The author writes in the acknowledgments that she spoke to 220 people for the book, in which case we have to assume that a great many of them had little to say.\nTo be fair to Odell, whose previous biography was of Anna Wintour, another difficult and controlling subject – although Wintour did give Odell some access – Paltrow’s world is notoriously hard to break into if she’s not on board with a project; the author quotes numerous hacks tasked with profiling Paltrow for magazines who found themselves iced out of her networks, and the same happens to her in the early stages of research. Odell’s task only gets harder in the second half of the book, which tackles the Goop years. Since, she claims, many of its staff signed NDAs, those sections lack even the modest stream of gossip that enlivens the first half.\nWhich, by the way, is perfectly enjoyable. I ripped through Odell’s account of Paltrow’s youth as the simultaneously indulged and benignly neglected daughter of two showbusiness big guns, the actor Blythe Danner and the producer and director Bruce Paltrow. Danner is prim and unemotional; Bruce Paltrow is more demonstrative but still emotionally evasive, and Odell reheats some well-documented episodes between father and daughter, such as the trip they made to Paris when Paltrow was around 10, during which Bruce told her: “I wanted you to see Paris for the first time with a man who will always love you, no matter what.” (Paltrow, in interviews, has always offered up this story as a moving tribute to her dad’s love for her.) Odell also tells us the (I think) new detail that, when Paltrow was older, “her dad once gave her lace underwear as a gift”. It’s a small addition but it stands out against what feels like the book’s trove of reconstituted material.\nIn 1984, when Paltrow was 12, the family moved from LA to New York. We learn that she felt out-classed at Spence, the Upper East Side private school where the money is older and the blood bluer than in the Danner-Paltrow household. We also learn that, in spite of this, Paltrow – whose biggest nightmare is listed in the senior school yearbook as “obesity” – manages to form a clique around herself that may or may not have been involved in the drawing of a penis on the library wall. It’s small potatoes but we’ll take it. Odell goes into great depth about the Williamstown theatre festival – presumably because the old theatre lags actually agreed to talk to her – a storied annual event in rural Massachusetts where Danner takes her daughter every summer, first to watch her mother on stage, and later, to act herself. I liked these passages, in which you get a real sense of a summer stock scene that has always attracted top actors and their nepo babies. At one point, a barely teenage Paltrow takes the assistant director’s seat and the head of the festival fails to ask her to move. Paltrow is entitled, wan, sometimes foul-mouthed, intensely focused and in these scenes, really comes alive. By studying her mother on stage, she learns how to be an actor.\nAnd so on to the Hollywood years, where everything becomes less fresh and more familiar. We slog through the background to productions of Emma, Shallow Hal and Shakespeare in Love and then we get to Harvey Weinstein, who during the first flush of #MeToo, Paltrow accused of making a pass at her. Odell quotes from Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey’s book, She Said, but there’s not much more to be harvested on a story broken and pursued by such good reporters. What’s left is a trawl through a lot of things we already know – although there is one very funny motif from those years, which involves Paltrow miming throwing up behind the backs of people she dislikes, one of whom is Minnie Driver. (Team Driver all the way, here, obviously.) Also an old friend of Paltrow’s claims “she invented ghosting”, which sounds about right.\nFinally, Goop: this was a story I hadn’t been paying much attention to lately, and so a genuine surprise of the book is to learn that the company founded by Paltrow in 2008 has been a much shakier business than advertised. We know that Goop paid to settle a lawsuit brought by the California Food, Drug and Medical Device Task Force over false claims about the health benefits of the vaginal eggs. And we also know it accepted judgments by the National Advertising Division about other false claims. But, as Odell puts it, Paltrow’s “middling run as the CEO of Goop” has ensured that the company “hasn’t experienced sustained profitability … and has lacked a clear business strategy as it ping-pongs from one of Gwyneth’s ideas to the next”.\nHere’s a reveal: that Paltrow is such a massive cheapskate she used Goop’s food editors to cook for her. “In the office,” writes Odell, “it was common knowledge that the food editors would go to Gwyneth’s house after work and make her dinner under the guise of ‘recipe testing’. When she and Brad Falchuk were living apart, the food editor would bring dinner to his house, too, which wasn’t a light lift in LA traffic.” She also asked vendors to donate their services to her and Falchuk’s wedding in return for advertising.\nThe difficulty with all this is that Paltrow is a charmless subject who never rises to the level of monstrous. She’s an OK actor, a so-so businesswoman – Kim Kardashian, as Odell points out, has had much greater success with her company, Skims. The story, then, is less about how Paltrow became this figure in the culture than why on earth she was elevated in the first place. Odell doesn’t have the time or the inclination to get into this, instead offering pat lines such as, “love her or hate her, for over 30 years, we haven’t been able to look away”.\nAt the very end, Odell draws a line between Paltrow’s peddling of pseudoscience on Goop and Robert F Kennedy Jr, “a fellow raw milk drinker” and Trump’s vaccine-sceptical health secretary, which feels like a sudden turn towards a more interesting and confident authorial voice. If only it had piloted the whole book."

    "raw_text": "The first trailer for Emerald Fennell’s new take on Wuthering Heights promises a more erotically charged take on the classic Emily Brontë novel.\nFennell, who won an Oscar for her screenplay for Promising Young Woman, directs Australian actors Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as Catherine and Heathcliff. The supporting cast includes Hong Chau, Martin Clunes and the Adolescence breakout star Owen Cooper.\nThe project started a bidding war in 2024 after Fennell’s second film, Saltburn, overcame divisive reviews and poor box office to become a hit on Amazon Prime. Netflix reportedly offered $150m but the deal was won by Warner Bros, who paid just $80m, with both Fennell and Robbie expressing their desire for a theatrical release.\nLast month saw reports that the film received mixed reactions from an early test screening. Early viewers allegedly called it “aggressively provocative and tonally abrasive” with one scene of a public hanging in which the “condemned man ejaculates mid-execution”.\nThis week also saw billboards go up in major UK and US cities teasing the release with provocative imagery and the tagline used in the trailer: “drive me mad”.\nRobbie is coming off the back of smash hit Barbie and will be seen later this month opposite Colin Farrell in the fantasy A Big Bold Beautiful Journey. Elordi, who gained fame on TV’s Euphoria, has since starred in Priscilla and On Swift Horses and will next be seen in Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein.\nEarlier this year, Elordi spoke about Wuthering Heights in an interview with Deadline. “The performances from everyone – it’s breathtaking,” he said. “It’s an incredible romance. It’s a true epic. It’s visually beautiful. The script is beautiful. The costumes are incredible.”\nThe choice to cast Elordi has already led to a backlash, with many fans of the novel pointing out that Heathcliff is described as having dark skin. The casting director, Karmel Cochrane, defended the decision earlier this year.\n“There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot,” she said. “But just wait till you see it, and then you can decide whether you want to shoot me or not. But you really don’t need to be accurate. It’s just a book. That is not based on real life. It’s all art.”\nThe novel has seem numerous adaptations over the years, including William Wyler’s 1939 film and Andrea Arnold’s 2011 version.\nThe film will be released on Valentine’s Day next year."

    "raw_text": "In fashion, desirable accessories are nothing new. See the Fendi baguette, the It bag of the 00s, or the recent fad for chunky dad trainers. But, as social media’s influence on style becomes more heightened, it is shoes, bags and hats that are hogging the spotlight more than ever. This is the era of the viral accessory.\nJW Anderson’s pigeon bag – a clutch that is a resin model of the bird – is a popular example. It has a waiting list on the brand’s site, where it was the most-viewed item in August. It has since been carried by Sarah Jessica Parker on the set of And Just Like That … and by Sam Smith at London fashion week.\nBalenciaga is another brand that has made accessories for the social media age. Its adverts recently went viral for the wrong reasons – they showed children carrying handbags that were teddy bears dressed in BDSM outfits. Previous examples of the brand’s viral items include a bag that looks like a rubbish bag but costs £1,290, and a take on the famous Ikea Frakta that cost £1,365 compared with Ikea’s 40p original.\nBut the viral accessory is not limited to designer fashion. This year, other items that reached fever pitch online – largely through TikTok - included the £90 Birkenstock Boston mule, and a crossbody bag from Uniqlo that cost £14.90.\nVideos with #uniqlobag have 35.2m views on TikTok, and it inspired a similar design by fast fashion brand Shein. The desire for the Bostons this year was so heightened that resellers were selling them for inflated prices. In October, the New York Times reported on a consumer buying a pair for $330 (£271), compared with the RRP of $160 (£131).\nIn their report for the third quarter of 2022, fashion search engine Lyst noted that eight of the 10 most sought after items were accessories – from the Miu Miu ballet flats which saw a 1,100% spike in searches, to the Birkenstock Boston. This is set to continue. In the catwalk collections for spring/summer 2023, bags including crystal teddybear bags (Gucci) and a doll’s house (Louis Vuitton) are already gaining buzz, and elbow-length gloves look set to be a trend.\n“Accessories have become a world of their own as opposed to just a complimentary offering to ready-to-wear,” says Libby Page, the market director at Net-a-Porter. “For the autumn/winter season alone, we significantly increased our assortment of bags, shoes and accessories by 65% due to high demand from customers.”\nResale app Depop reports that 80% of its shoppers say social media is the source of their inspiration in part because secondhand items are more affordable. “The cost of living crisis is impacting shopping habits across the nation, with many of us having less disposable income to spend on replenishing our wardrobe,” says Depop’s trends manager, Agustina Panzoni.\nDesigner accessories are a savvy choice – they are cheaper, and a more affordable entry into luxury brands. They are also a way to display your fashion prowess even if the outfit they are worn with is unremarkable. “We’re seeing more and more shoppers trial a trend through accessories before committing to purchase higher priced wardrobe staples,” says Panzoni. Vintage Fendi baguette bags are particularly popular – with searches increasing 2,600% this year.\nBiz Sherbert, the culture editor at The Digital Fairy brand consultancy, says an accessories-first approach makes sense in the social media age. “They can act as like a prop in your photo,” she says. “and take on new forms in terms of what they represent [when seen] online.”\nPart of the success of these accessories may be that they have something of a cartoonish quality – which plays out well in that very online end of visual culture, the meme. In 2020, it was estimated that at least 1m were shared on Instagram every day. They are a way to show we are in on the joke, and the news cycle. Fashion has long been part of meme culture – with everything from Kim Kardashian’s Met gala dress to Rihanna’s arrival at a Dior show turned into one.\nWearing an accessory seen in a meme – or one that is asking for a meme – is perhaps the next step of this connection. “Memes can really take a kind of innocuous object and form a full identity of the person around it,” says Sherbert. “It can be really interesting, entertaining and silly as well.”\nHey Reilly has an Instagram account dedicated to creating fashion memes, and has noticed the influence of meme culture on accessories. “This accessories trend is born of memes, [and there is also] none too subtly fishing to be memed.” Digital disruptors and Insta creatives shrink or supersize latest trends on celebs for lols, then we see designers offering extra extra large coats and shoes or teeny tiny handbags,” he says.\nThis style cannibalism will likely only increase. Even as the focus of social media moves away from Instagram, the power of the statement accessory still holds. “[That’s especially true] in something like BeReal,” says Sherbert of the “anti-Instagram” app that sends users a prompt to post pictures wherever they are once a day. “The photos are kind of weird and blurry. No one can see what outfit you’re wearing but a distinctive accessory stands out.”\nReilly is cynical about this trend suggesting accessories designed for a meme “take some of the critical sting out of an idea”. He points to an Instagram post of a French stick by Silvia Fendi, as a nod to the brand’s famous Baguette bag. “It’s fashion and [social media] eating themselves,” he says. Balenciaga’s teddy bear adverts, designed to be shared online, also suggests a brand’s quest to secure that viral accessory moment can sometimes go too far."

    "raw_text": "Fashion is a vocabulary. Clothing communicates parts of who we are, what we are interested in and how we want to be seen. It reveals choices that we make – but it also exposes lack of choice.\nI am a disabled woman; I have dwarfism. My disability and stature is obvious and often shapes a first interaction. I’ve learned to love scouring through rails of clothes in high street stores and charity shops, and taking the items for alterations to make sure they fit. I know that if there are patterns or embroidery near the shoulder or ankle of a garment, altering it won’t work. I’ve found that jeans and trousers have to be elasticated at the back so they go over my hips with ease and don’t gape at the back. I’ve also learned that dresses and skirts should have an asymmetrical hemline to accommodate the curve in my spine. As I’ve got older, I’ve discovered that many of these alterations don’t just work for me, but would also improve comfort, independence and dressing for most people. Accessible design is better design.\nTo show you what this looks like in action: I recently had the pleasure of attending a dinner to mark Jannik Sinner’s return to Wimbledon. Beforehand, I was nervous. I wanted to wear something that would instil confidence, be comfortable and allow me to move about with personality and dignity. I chose a blazer, cashmere jumper and black pants. During my time working in fashion, I had the privilege of building relationships with designers, and this jacket was custom-made by Gucci. The pocket is proportional and the buttons are deliberately placed to be mindful of my figure. The wool pants are also custom-made by Prada and close with a fastener and zip, rather than a button, to avoid dexterity issues, and the back of the waistband is elasticated. The jumper is from Johnstons of Elgin in Scotland – their store is step-free and has rails at multiple levels. I chose it because it needed no alterations; the short-sleeve is mid‑length for me, and wearable throughout the year.\nI’ve spent almost a decade working in the luxury fashion industry, because I want more choice, more representation and more respect for disabled customers – and across the industry there is lots to celebrate.\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum currently has an exhibition called Design and Disability, curated by Natalie Kane, that shows the innovation in accessibility. It features the work of Victoria Jenkins, the disabled designer behind Unhidden, a leading adaptive brand that will be part of this year’s official London Fashion Week.\nTommy Hilfiger has an adaptive collection, Liberare creates bras that close at the front rather than the back, Tilt Beauty has a line of products that allow you to put mascara on with greater ease, and Primark has increased representation in the in-store mannequins and begun to make their childrenswear range seam- and label-free for neurodivergent kids. But, we need to think of disabled people as more than customers.\nIn 2020, I founded Tilting the Lens, a strategic accessibility consultancy that aims to create the conditions for disabled people to be successful. We’ve developed a scholarship for disabled designers with Parsons School of Design in New York, and we’ve spent the past year undertaking research with more than 200 disabled people across the UK to develop a white paper on adaptive fashion, to improve understanding of the market and innovation opportunities. We’ve learned so much about making clothing more inclusive, but also the need for stores and real estate, packing and delivery to be accessible, too. I want disabled people to be valued consumers – but for that to happen they also need to be decision-makers, leaders and trustees."

    "raw_text": "It is strange that we talk about date-night dressing so much when we all know that the most fun nights to outfit-plan are really nights out with friends. Well, not actually strange at all, just the patriarchy doing what it does, I guess, and making it feel as if the world as seen from a male point of view – in this case, the view of a frock from the other side of a restaurant table on date night – is automatically the point of view that matters.\nIn a fashion context, it just makes no sense. I mean, I accept that I’m generalising wildly here, and I don’t for a moment claim to speak for everyone. But my own experience, which I would wager is a fairly common one, is that it is an evening out with friends when I’m going to get maximum appreciation for the fashion content of my outfit. Men just want you to look … nice? Which is fine, but there’s a lot more to style than that. Like I say, I am generalising, and not all dates are boy-girl anyway, but still: for many women, dressing up for friends is one of life’s under-appreciated joys.\nFashion is a love language in female friendships. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie\nOn a friends night, you can be wildly overdressed for pizza and your pals will appreciate your look for what it is: enthusiasm for their company. Or you can turn up in your work clothes because you had to run straight from the office, and they won’t give a toss and just be thrilled to see you. You can wear your new leather trousers and know you will get the chance to tell, at great length, the triumphant story of how you tracked them down on Vinted. You can wear totally impractical shoes and nobody will roll their eyes when it means you have to get an Uber to a bar a quarter of a mile away.\nFashion is a love language in female friendship. It is woven into the fabric of camaraderie between women. There is no place on earth where you will be more generously complimented than in front of the mirrors of the ladies’ loos, after everyone involved has had a few spicy margs. I’m not being sexist – it might well be that the same goes for men, but I don’t hang out by the urinals so I can’t speak to that. What I can tell you is that chat about clothes is, first and foremost, a delivery mechanism for support and cheerleading, woman to woman. Wear something bold, and you will get flowers for your originality; wear something low-key, and you will be lauded for your subtle good taste. Style is a channel of communication.\nSome features will always get a mention, when women talk about clothes. For instance: dresses and skirts that have pockets. Responding “it has pockets!” when another woman remarks upon what you are wearing is shorthand for “I enjoy fashion even though I have more important things to think about, and I think I recognise you as a kindred spirit”. See also: responding to an admiring comment about a pretty pair of shoes by saying they are “surprisingly comfy” and playing down your snazzy dress by revealing, without being asked, that it is 10 years old and from Zara.\nBut the love language of fashion between the girls isn’t just about solidarity, it is about joy. It is about clothes that are chosen not because they make you look taller or thinner, but because they make you smile. Which are, of course, the clothes that make you truly beautiful. It is about outfits that get captured in selfies, that you treasure not because of what you were wearing but because of the good time you had, and so are knitted into core memories. Nights out with friends, with pals who know your silly side as well as your smart side, who might rib you for wearing double leopard-print but would defend to the hilt your right to do so if anyone said a word against it, are the nights that are the most fun to get dressed for. Date night does not have a monopoly on love.\nModel: Amaka at Milk. Hair and makeup: Sophie Higginson using Bumble & Bumble and Refy. Cherry earrings, £14, bag, £46, and heels, £44, all River Island.

    "raw_text": "Our 11-year-old daughter is in a “friendship” with a classmate, which we have come to realise is unhealthy and controlling. She was very shy and self-conscious through the early years of school and struggled to make friends, so we were initially delighted that she had found a close friend. However, we’ve become aware that there is a consistent pattern of control from this girl: demands about when and where they meet, or what our daughter can and can’t wear. If our daughter goes against her, she risks being shunned and ignored or spoken to aggressively.\nThis girl does not let our daughter interact with others without her. There is a barrage of demanding messages and calls at home about arrangements, and we see our daughter being vigilant and tense, having to respond immediately. Sometimes there is unkindness, for example saying our daughter’s clothes are babyish. Around the controlling behaviour, they seem to interact more normally, having fun, playing and chatting – it is this Jekyll and Hyde pattern that makes it so difficult to know how to support our daughter.\nWe know this girl has problems with anxiety, and haven’t spoken with her parents, but feel we will have to. Our daughter has become more open about what is going on, and we are trying to support her to be more assertive and to recognise that this controlling behaviour is not OK. She seems to understand and feel this to a degree, but so far is not able to say anything. Sometimes she gets angry with us if we talk about it. We see her feeling powerless and want her to move on from this situation. The girls are about to start secondary school and are in the same class.\nWhat a lot for your daughter to deal with. This is a horrible situation. A word with her new teacher is definitely in order. It’s a shame they are in the same class, because this is a perfect opportunity for your daughter to split from this friend and start anew.\nUKCP-registered child and adolescent psychotherapist Ross Cormack was “struck by the feelings of powerlessness you see in your daughter, and these feelings seem to have been replicated in your responses. You’ve grown in awareness in terms of the negative behaviours put on your daughter, yet remain uncertain in how best to respond. Powerlessness can freeze families, which can exacerbate stressful situations as it feels there’s no way out.”\nYou’ve identified that this girl has anxiety problems (fear makes people want to control situations), but it isn’t your job, nor your daughter’s, to fix that.\nIt’s great your daughter is speaking to you, but “there is a need for more ‘action’ from you to support and protect your daughter”, said Cormack. “This kind of behaviour needs clear boundaries and expectations. It would be a difficult situation for an adult to manage, so your daughter needs help.”\nWhat’s important is that your daughter doesn’t become more anxious. Also, he said, “talking to her about being assertive locates the solution solely in her, when she doesn’t have the capacity or the confidence to be assertive. I would encourage instead that you think about helping her set clearer boundaries. For example, where is the ‘line’ with phone calls and texts over what’s acceptable?”\nI would do this: inform the teacher; try to build my child’s self-esteem; tell her that “no” is a complete sentence, and let her practise saying it in environments she feels safer in.\nEncourage her to invite other friends round and to join clubs her friend doesn’t belong to. Let her know she can always come to you to talk (and be calm when she does), and ensure that when she comes home, her mobile goes on a shelf so she can detach from school. (You may need to model this.) Sometimes our children need us to be the backbone.\nI’m not sure about going to the other parents. In my experience, parents tend to think their child is never at fault. Ultimately, your child will learn that no one can or should control her behaviour (not even you) and that controlling isn’t about love or friendship, but about power. And anyone who needs to get power over another person is actually displaying weakness. These are big things for anyone to learn, let alone an 11-year-old, and they may take time.

    "raw_text": "I am 83, and my life seems to have been mostly happy. But after a year at art college, I sort of disintegrated and was sent to a mental hospital after I had tried to kill myself several times. My best explanation is that life was too difficult and painful. But why?\nIn the hospital I had 15 electric shock treatments. After the first one I didn’t recognise my mum. I had a blinding headache, and the fear of never waking up was strong. I was given antipsychotic drugs and sedatives. I caused a lot of worry to my parents, but I couldn’t “pull myself together”. Looking back, I see myself as a caring person who helped the confused and unhappy ladies who were locked away in that massive old mental hospital, where, in a way, I felt at home.\nAfterwards, I decided to go to Italy, where I recovered gradually and stopped the medication. I started teaching English and enjoyed it.\nSince then, I have lived a full and in many ways successful life. But the question is, what happened to me?\nPeople make seemingly random decisions all the time, but when we look back they had more purpose than they seemed to and were often informed by our environment. You were courageous, and still are for writing to me and thinking about this difficult time in your life, which must have been traumatic. And like all trauma, it’s stuck in your memory as snapshots, which you are now trying to make sense of.\nTrauma memories aren’t laid down like regular memories in the brain. You can learn more about this by listening to the podcast I did on this subject with Dr Joanne Stubley, a consultant medical psychotherapist who leads the trauma service for adults at the Tavistock and Portman NHS trust in England. I showed her your letter and we were both curious about what led up to your breakdown. Mental health issues were not always dealt with well in the early 1960s, and the landscape back then was, as Stubley describes it: “power-based and misogynistic”. Things aren’t perfect now, but there’s certainly more understanding.\nWe also wondered what was happening around that time for you? What led to life being so difficult? Young people don’t have breakdowns and attempt suicide in a vacuum.\n“You showed great resilience moving to Italy,” said Stubley. “You had the capacity to get yourself up and away [from a place where difficult things happened] to live a life where you were giving to others, teaching English.”\nEven in the psychiatric hospital, you said you were looking after others. No wonder you’re thinking, “What about me? Who was thinking of me?” It’s not unusual to have these questions as we age and realise we have more years behind us than ahead. “You seem to have great courage and capacity to ask yourself these questions,” said Stubley. “That sense you have of, ‘What happened to me? What really went on here?’ is impressive.”\nOne of the hallmarks of trauma is feeling alone in a situation, of being disempowered. A way to process it is to understand what happened. I wondered if you might try to find out if any of your medical notes from this time still exist.\nStubley also suggested “starting to have conversations. It doesn’t have to be formal therapy. It could be with a good friend, a counsellor, anyone who would be able to offer you the space to explore and tell your life story so you may get more of an understanding of it. Are there any relatives alive from that time who you could talk to?”\nI thought it was interesting you made a geographical move, and to a place where English isn’t routinely spoken. You really left your old self behind, but now it’s time to integrate the two.

    "raw_text": "Scott, 42\nI put off meeting Maria because of my insecurities about how I looked, after my illness. But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with her\nWhen I slid into Maria’s DMs, saying something like, “You seem intriguing – sending love and light,” I wasn’t expecting anything to come from it. I’d had an ongoing illness since my early 20s, had lost a lot of weight and become reclusive. But something in me was changing; I’d decided to come off the medication I’d been on for years, hoping to improve my health so I had the energy to push myself out of my isolated state.\nI put off meeting Maria because of my insecurities about how I looked, after my illness. But once we met, I wanted to spend all my time with her. I hadn’t had sex in 15 years and had almost forgotten what it felt like. But sex with Maria – slow and sensual, with lots of kissing and touching – was completely different to the sex I’d had in my 20s. It was the kind of sex I’d always wanted but never had.\nStill, there was an imbalance; Maria was a working mum, while I wasn’t working, which caused tension. She would push me away, wanting to be with someone who could relate to what was going on in her life and support her. To become that, I needed to be in a position, physically and mentally, where I could work again. Not long after meeting Maria, my health rebounded almost miraculously. Stopping medication helped me gain 23kg, my strength returned, and I got a job, which made our relationship more equal.\nIt felt so good to be having sex again after such a long time, and with a beautiful woman I felt passionately about, that I wanted to have it almost every time we saw each other. As a working mother, Maria didn’t have the energy for that, and resented not being able to be present for her daughter in the way she wanted to be. Sex was off the table when her daughter was around, and Maria’s interest in a slower, non-goal-oriented Tantric approach, where we just breathe and touch each other, sometimes with our clothes on, didn’t seem the best use of the time we had. I became frustrated that my needs weren’t being met.\nMaria suggested we take a three-month break. I used the time to focus on my career and work on myself, and our relationship is stronger since we got back together a month ago. Although I’d love to build a life together, and hope one day we will, I’m realising that Maria’s need for us to have our own lives is healthy, especially when I’m still rebuilding mine.\nMaria, 35\nWith my daughter’s father, I felt neglected, rejected and invisible. But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexy\nAround the time Scott DM’d me, I was sharing a bedroom with my five-year-old daughter and hadn’t had sex in five years. After I suggested we move the conversation to WhatsApp, we started messaging constantly. I craved being with him, and felt as if I missed his body, even though we hadn’t met yet.\nWhen we eventually met three months later, I felt a disconnect between the person in front of me and who I’d got to know over the phone. He was like a ghost in the world, and it scared me – as a mother, I couldn’t risk getting into a relationship with the wrong person. Online he was great company, but in reality, he couldn’t walk properly and was in pain. Everything seemed much more real and complicated. But when I pulled back, he pushed forward.\nThe first time we had sex, it felt so natural. Scott was what I’d always dreamed of: attentive, caring, open‑minded, curious. I’d had sexual relationships since I was 16, but I never felt satisfied the way I do with Scott. In my relationship with my daughter’s father, I felt neglected, rejected and invisible. But Scott makes me feel valued, appreciated and sexy.\nI wished we could spend hours in bed together, but I had to get up for work and make my daughter breakfast. When she was at her dad’s, Scott and I would explore Tantra and kink. But when that kind of sex left me feeling drained, I started to set boundaries.\nWhen I suggested three months without sex, I wanted space to re-energise. The break gave us the reset we needed. We’re both more present, and there’s more communication before, during and after sex. I’ve asked Scott to check in before initiating, so I can pause to see if it’s truly what I want, and that mindful consent makes me feel more connected to him. So now, instead of feeling drained after sex, I feel nourished."

    "raw_text": "Mabel, 33\nThe safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely\nWhen Finn and I met on a dating app last year, I was enjoying being single. So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in, I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with my freedom being a positive thing.\nMy ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague. So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality.\nThe safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,” which I thought was very romantic.\nI’ve heard that there are two ways of experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists overtook us, it was thrilling.\nWe’ve both said past relationships were things that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole time talking about how lucky we are.\nWe’re about to move in together, and I can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time. Yesterday, we went to the butcher and B&Q, and even that was fun. When I’m with Finn, everything feels like an adventure.\nFinn, 33\nOur sex life has become more adventurous. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth\nI wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.\nOn our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it cool.\nWe have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it too.\nIn previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more interesting than my previous ones.\nMy relationships have never lasted longer than two years, and I’ve avoided conversations about marriage and kids. When I was 21, I had a toxic relationship and a messy break-up, where I cheated, and my partner became possessive and insecure, which affected my ability to commit to others. But Mabel and I speak about spending the rest of our lives together. Maybe it’s the age we met at – we don’t need to wait. It’s the best sex of my life, and the possibility of having that for ever makes me feel very lucky."

    "raw_text": "As I approached my mid 30s, a relationship I’d been in since I was 21 reached its natural conclusion. Becoming single was a revelation; it gave me such a sense of empowerment as I was undergoing a big career change from teaching to social work.\nIt was during my final placement in 2024 that I met Mill and was immediately curious about them. The working environment they created was really beautiful and safe, and they had this unusual balance of reserve and openness.\nWe’d have these great chats on Teams, that often veered into something that felt like a real friendship, but Mill was my manager and we were both trying to keep things professional.\nThe potential power imbalance was somewhat mitigated by the fact that I’m actually a few years older, and once my placement was over it was me who made the first move. I asked Mill out to a gig in the work chat and the question hung in the air for weeks.\nAt the last minute, they took me up on the invitation and we shared the quintessential queer experience of neither of us being sure if we were on a date or not.\nWe didn’t really listen to any of the music that night; we couldn’t stop chatting. It was over the course of that evening that I realised Mill wasn’t nearly as serious as I’d thought. They have a great sense of humour and we learned we shared more in common than we realised. We’d both lived through our wild ratbag phases and were leading more wholesome lives, and knowing we shared that balance was really attractive.\nNot long after the gig, Mill went out on a limb and sent me a text sharing their feelings for me. A few weeks later we went on our first official date. We went to a soju bar for a nightcap after a comedy gig and took a long walk along the Birrarung before sharing our first kiss in front of an audience of garbage collectors as they emptied bins in the decidedly unromantic setting of a desolate Fed Square in Melbourne.\nI’d long wondered whether I was queer, and my previous forays, while meaningful and positive, hadn’t confirmed anything for me. I was really conscious of not wasting people’s time or messing them around while I figured myself out, but with Mill things were different. The attraction was immense, but there was also a deep sense of safety and calmness I felt around them. As we spent more time together outside work, I began to see the full form of this person. Their beauty and generosity of spirit runs so deep. Over the next few months we became a couple.\nMill is always thinking of others. If you visit their house, they’ll make you a snack pack when you leave and they love to celebrate other’s achievements.\nAs the year came to an end and my social work studies were complete, it was time to decide if I’d continue paying fees to remain a registered teacher or let it lapse. It felt like a huge deal for me to close the door on teaching but I made the call and I was really excited to get the letter that confirmed it was official.\nWhen it arrived, Mill showed up at my front door with a homemade carrot cake decorated with the words “Happy Deregistration”.\nI already knew what a good sort Mill was, but in that moment it really became clear that I was with a profoundly kind human being; someone who noticed little details, cared about what was going on for me and was on my team.\nEven though the cake was about a bureaucratic detail, more than that it was the celebration of a new chapter, a deepening of my conviction in the life I wanted.\nAs a younger person I always felt compelled to keep as many doors open as possible, but you can’t be all things to all people. It’s been a huge relief to shake off any lingering shackles of social expectations and my own indecisiveness. To be with someone with whom you share such a sense of being known and cherished, and really belonging, is so rare and so liberating. Being with Mill feels like the opposite of loneliness.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "In May 2018, I was scrolling through prospective dates on Bumble when I saw Charlie’s profile. I could tell we had a lot of immediate connections. He had worked for human rights organisations, travelled a lot and even had interesting profile pictures. I swiped right.\nLater that day, we met at a small bar close to my work in Melbourne for a drink. Even though it was a good first date, I decided I didn’t have the energy for more dates straight away and cancelled our second one. I think he thought I was a bit of a time waster.\nA month later, I was visiting family in Perth and my mum asked if I was seeing anyone. I expressed frustration that it’s so hard to sort through all the garbage on dating apps – but there was one guy I’d met who seemed lovely and had a beautiful smile. So when I got back to Melbourne we met again for dumplings, and it was on.\nAfter just six months together we moved into his one-bedroom bachelor pad. That was a massive mistake. We did it way too fast and immediately started squabbling. It was just too soon for two very independent people who had spent a lot of time building up their own lives to be suddenly trying to mesh them together.\nBy March 2020, our bickering was at an all-time high. We decided to see a couples counsellor before going on a one-month trip to South America – we didn’t want to ruin the trip for ourselves. I remember immediately disliking the counsellor, which I think was more about what she revealed about us. At the end of the first session she just looked at us and said she didn’t think she could help because we were too far apart as individuals for things to work out. We were like, that’s really bad!\nBefore we left Australia we’d heard murmurings about this new virus emerging but we were feeling smug that we were escaping. After five incredible days hiking across Patagonia, we found ourselves bunkering down in a small hotel room in Punta Arenas as the news of Covid spread across the world.\nFlights were cancelled, borders were closing, we had desperate messages from friends and family. We were freaking out. It went from a complete state of relaxation and wonder at the world to OMFG the world is melting down.\nCharlie was way more relaxed about it than me. He was like, we’ll be OK. It just wasn’t in his realm of possibility that we wouldn’t get home. So while I was contacting embassies, trying to change flights and reaching out to friends and family to figure out our way home, Charlie was happily imagining our new life in Chile. “Babe, imagine how good we’ll get at Spanish,” he said. A line I’ll always remember.\nIn the hotel room in Punta Arenas I knew that if the world was ending, as it felt like it was, it was him I wanted to be next to. Charlie was making us go on walks, making up songs and cracking jokes the whole time. He was bringing me out of my anxiety loop. We balanced each other out perfectly in that crisis, on opposite ends of the scale.\nEventually, we got seats on one of the last flights back from Chile before the borders closed. We were waiting on standby at the airport, and we only got seats on the flight because two temporary residents were booted off when the rules changed and only permanent residents could get back into Australia. It really was the most bonkers time.\nCharlie proposed in July 2020 and we eloped in December 2020.\nI thought our time in Chile was going to be the worst thing we would go through – but we have faced many difficulties together since then.\nThrough it all, I’m always so grateful to have him by my side. We never went back to that couples counsellor.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Did Saturdays even exist before the Blind date column? Not as far as I’m concerned. The start of the weekend was a joyless desert until, in 2009, Weekend magazine started sending two hapless (my words) strangers out for dinner in the hope that three courses, a bottle of house white and the terror of appearing in a national newspaper would be the accelerant a romantic spark needs to go full inferno.\nI have been obsessed with Blind date for most of its 10-year existence. Its simplicity is deceptive: what the daters say leaves plenty of room for interpretation. On the surface, the questions are formulaic – somewhere between inane smalltalk at a stranger’s house party and the sexless interrogation of a dietary questionnaire from your GP. But in the context of the column, they are traps – and I love to see the participants fall right in, revealing themselves via the short aside that they shared a pudding with their date. And let’s not forget that score out of 10. Brutal to have adults rate one another, you might say. Delicious, I say.\nThe key to its success? It’s relatable. I used to write an anonymous dating blog as The Guyliner. I know what it’s like out there. I have sat at deathly dull dinners with the king of halitosis talking about his loft conversion. I have taken sneaky glances at my watch as a partied-out zombie talked me through his negroni-inspired accumulator hangover. I have also dropped clangers, watched my date’s face plummet and realised that my half of the bill is no longer an investment in a bright future, but a tax on my stupidity.\nThis is why I love Blind date so much. But its two slim columns in the middle of Weekend, barely 400 words a week, weren’t enough for me. Every Saturday, I would dash to social media to debrief with other devotees. The disasters! The fairytale endings! Even the kind of “meh” ones where two clean-shirts spent two hours saying, “No, after you” over a dish of calamari – we discussed them all.\nIn July 2014, after years of writing about my own dates, I was coupled up and looking for something new to write about. It occurred to me that it might be fun to look deeper into Blind date, to read between the lines. In the same way that the Guardian’s episode recaps of Line Of Duty or Game Of Thrones are must-reads for fans eager to dissect their favourite dramas, I wanted to put Blind date under the microscope.\nThus my blog, Impeccable Table Manners, was born, taking its name from the stock reply given by many daters to the “Good table manners?” question. The tone is light snark, with greater savagery deployed occasionally for some of the biggest shockers. I try not to get too personal; I’m critiquing what people say, not who they are, and I invite dates to get in touch if they want to give their side of the story. To my surprise, the blog’s popularity grew and grew. Soon, every Saturday morning, my Twitter mentions were full of people asking when the review was going up – sometimes as early as 7.30am. (Guys, it’s Saturday.)\nThe idea was to take the daters’ answers and run with them. Sometimes, quite far. Almost every column inspires me in some way, and if I get speechless, well, there is always an animated gif of Joan Collins rolling her eyes close at hand. And while this bit is fun, every week the date throws up a deeper topic for me to chew on. I have touched on loneliness, snobbery, racism, misogyny, masculinity, poverty and kindness. An awkward answer about who gets to pour the wine can get me going on just about anything.\nThe blog has developed running gags of its own – my readers and I react very strongly to lateness (no!), negronis (yuck!), daters worrying they talked too much (you are on a date, hun; talking is the point), chopsticks (always a disaster), sharing food (no, thank you), people who say, “I think my friends would be too much for them” about their crew of magnolia acolytes and, of course, the dreaded “impeccable”: find a new word (except don’t, because I love it).\nThere have been occupational hazards. One guy I reviewed is now my editor at GQ magazine (awkward). Another woman was halfway through doing my makeup for a photoshoot before mentioning she had had the Impeccable treatment (she still made me look good). And I have been stopped in the street on numerous occasions by daters and fans of both the Weekend column and Impeccable Table Manners. The cult of Blind date is bigger than you might think.\nThey say you should never meet your heroes, but the completist in me wanted to find out exactly what goes on behind the scenes. Despite my readers’ frequent frustrations at the “algorithm” that puts daters together, it is not a supercomputer that does the matching. Nina Trickey, Weekend’s resident cupid, has been hooking up readers since 2012, curating the entire process: sifting the romantic hopefuls’ applications, matching them, booking the restaurant and compiling their answers. She has the perfect credentials for the job: as a favour to her friend Anna, her predecessor as cupid, Nina appeared in Blind date No 2.\nShe got on OK with Niall, 26. They scored each other an 8, but when asked if she would meet him again, Nina replied: “Not romantically. Also, he didn’t compliment me and I did him (on his shirt),” thus setting the tone for the hundreds of daters who would follow.\nYou need the precision of a heart surgeon to play Blind date matchmaker. Nina admits it can be hard. “I can’t match someone 100% of the time on what they say in that first email,” she says. “Some give you loads of information, but with others it’s just two lines. I have to get them in, see them for myself.” Daters are invited to have their photograph taken before their date – individually, of course, or where’s the surprise?\nSometimes applicants are too similar; the column is always running short of straight men, older couples and people outside the M25. While there may seem to be a Blind date “type”, anyone is welcome to take part and the goal is to make the column as diverse as possible.\nIs there ever a risk of being set up with someone who is merely available, rather than a decent match? Nina shakes her head emphatically. “No, there has to be something there.” Some daters wait quite a while – up to a year. “I do feel bad for unmatched people still sitting in my inbox, but I never forget them,” she says.\nThe meal is on the restaurant, in return for the honour of being featured; daters get three courses and one bottle of wine. Regular readers often bemoan dates that happen on a “school night”, which often prevents anyone getting too hot under the collar, but this is partly dictated by daters’ schedules and the restaurant’s availability. Even once the date is under way, there are fires to fight. A restaurant once accidentally offered the daters a very expensive tasting menu that they then asked the couple to pay for; on occasion, couples have twisted the rules when it comes to the free wine.\nNo-shows are rare, although one poor guy seemed to have the worst luck. “His first date stood him up, so I set him up again,” Nina says. “The second girl was a bit flakey and wouldn’t commit to a date.” So she took one for the team. Nina laughs: “Well, I was single at the time… I asked him out myself.” It didn’t last, and Nina is now spoken for, but she has been asked out by potential matches more than a few times.\nOnce the date is done, Nina sends out a questionnaire. The answer she looks forward to seeing the most? “The kiss, obviously! Just to see if I was right to match them – we do want people to get on. But I also like ‘Will you meet again?’” The editors have been known to cheer when news of a good date reaches the office.\nSince the column began in 2009, 542 couples have judged each other’s table manners. The first “Impeccable!” came early, in the very first date, while the first score of 10 came two months later – although it was not reciprocated. In fact, we waited almost five years for the first double 10, from students Josh and Biko, who answered “Did you go on somewhere?” with a baffling trip to M&M’s World in London. But to my mind, the first truly emphatic 10 – one of them even gave a bonus point for “taste in films” – came from Lizzie and Tomas in May 2017, who are getting married later this year. And yes, Nina and I are invited and will be making sure they don’t share their main course.\nPerhaps the biggest Blind date of all, published in January this year, belonged to Joanne and Morgan. This raucous duo really went for it – sinking endless bottles of wine, snogging ferociously, gatecrashing a party and, upon being ejected, discovering one of them had left their knickers behind. The encounter went viral; the next day, Joanne was on BBC Radio 5 Live explaining herself.\nBut before anyone loses their underwear, lovers must be matched. Nina’s cupid powers come into play at the photoshoot, where participants are photographed before their night out. It’s a tightly run production line, as I found when I joined her last month. Daters are escorted from the Guardian’s reception to a small studio and given 15 to 20 minutes to make the magic happen. Nina attends all the shoots, asking questions as she watches, her mind a Rolodex of potential matches. “You’ll see for yourself,” she says, as we wait for the first person to arrive. “Sometimes, something just clicks. But yes, there’s also a spreadsheet.”\nWithout exception, each of tonight’s six daters appears shellshocked. Suddenly, this becomes very real. Today’s photographer is the Guardian staffer Linda Nylind, who tells me she loves guessing how people will get on. Our first dater, a guy in his early 20s, is a natural and keen on doing a James Bond pose. More nervous individuals have to be encouraged out of their shell, perhaps surprising in the age of endless selfies. I enthusiastically join in with the directions, shouting out “drop your hip” far too many times than is appropriate.\nOnce a few shots are taken, the subjects get to see the results. While they can point out any definite nos, they are reminded they don’t get to choose the final picture. After all, who knows what their match’s best pose will be? One subject, Hannah, wears red shoes and a matching skirt and immediately sticks in my mind. We ask her preferred type. Quick as a flash: “No posh boys. I’ve dated a few and… no.” Another woman tells us she is looking for what her friends would call “an intellectual hunk”. “Yeah, I get a lot of requests for those,” deadpans Nina.\nTowards the end of the shoot, we meet Peter. We watch him pose – he is very enthusiastic and funny, but struggles when asked to touch his beard, going full Gunpowder Plot conspiratorial scratch. Then the cogs start to turn. Nina and I exchange a look. We glance through Peter’s details again, then Hannah’s. Is this happening live?\nOnce Peter is gone, Nina, Linda and I get our heads together. We consider for a moment whether each would be better with other people we photographed tonight. Nope, it’s definitely Peter and Hannah. The feeling of matching someone up is euphoric. Guys, I’m sorry if it goes badly… this one’s on me.\nIt’s a 10 from me: Justin Myers looks back on five favourite dates, and hears what happened next\nLizzie and Tomas, May 2017\nTomas said “She looks extremely cool.”\nI said “This is, basically, saying ‘I fancied her’ two questions in without coming across like someone who bought a top hat in 2011 just in case they got married some day.”\nTomas said “We talked about vomit, urinal etiquette, nude cycling.”\nI said “I have this feeling that when Tomas proposes to Lizzie – next autumn, at a place that meant something to her as a child, using the engagement ring of a relative or an antique bought with a legacy from a favourite godmother – he’ll hide the ring inside a pudding or a pebble or something. Please don’t do that, Tomas.”\nLizzie said “It was really hot in the restaurant, so I kept fanning myself like a delicate Dickensian woman.”\nI said “I don’t think she was fanning herself because of the temperature in the restaurant, do you, readers?”\nLizzie and Tomas’s date was published in a dark week, just after the Manchester Arena attack. This pair melted my icy heart because they were so unapologetically into each other. Every answer fizzed off the page with bubbles of joy, and their date was an emphatic double 10. What happened next?\n“When I saw he’d scored me a 10, I felt all warm and fuzzy inside,” Lizzie says now. On seeing his 10, Tomas claims he thought: “She is a great judge of character.”\nLizzie had been inspired to apply after reading through all the past Blind date columns on a Megabus journey home from Bristol. “I hoped I’d meet my true love, but never for one second thought I actually would,” she says. Both read my blog, so buckled in for a roasting there. “We were spared,” Tomas says. “It made the Blind date experience even more joyous.”\nLizzie adds: “It really summed up our feelings towards each other. By the third date, I wanted to be with Tom for ever. No messing about.” Wow. There appears to be something in my eye. She wasn’t wrong – the pair got engaged in April 2018, and the wedding is this winter.\nBut if we are searching for downsides, even this romantic bliss has a dark cloud. “I wish I’d done something with my hair,” says Lizzie of the Guardian photoshoot. “You don’t realise that, if the date goes really well and you end up getting married, that bad hair day will follow you through the rest of your life.”\nSo, Lizzie’s advice: get your hair done. And from Tomas? “Apply! It’s great fun and you never know where it might lead.”\nBeautiful.\nBenjamin and Mark, June 2015\nBenjamin said “We talked about our shared desire for a Georgian terrace house by Highbury Fields.”\nI said “Did you go to the top of the page, as I did, and check their ages again? You turn up on a date with some smooth-skinned honey in their 20s and all you can talk about is wanting a house?”\nMark said “Introduce him to my friends? I don’t think the opportunity will arise.”\nI said “Can anyone smell roasting flesh? Because, baby, that burns.”\nBenjamin said “Mark in three words? Smart, musical, cute.”\nI said “I am trying to imagine these two ‘doing it’, but all I can picture is two John Lewis gift cards sliding around on top of each other.”\nBenjamin, a 27-year-old composer, and Mark, a 21-year-old editorial assistant, did everything they could to destroy my theory that Blind dates involving two men were always more raucous. Two old heads on young shoulders, they talked of Björk, operettas and property. At least they shattered a few stereotypes along the way.\nLooking back on it now, Benjamin concedes: “The evening was spark-free and chemistry-light.” He feels Mark may have been taking the date a lot more seriously than he had been expecting. “No one really goes on Blind date to find true love, right?” Mark’s take was more vinegary. “I could tell fairly well how it had gone,” Benjamin says, “but his first adjective to describe me was ‘punctual’ – brutal.”\nMark confesses he regrets his words a little. “I came across as cold and cruel, which was definitely not the intention,” he insists. “I had a good time, but clearly struggled to convey that.” He concedes that the friends quip was “savage”.\nThe thing to remember about going on a Blind date is that people you know will see it. And so will your mother. Mark said that reading my review of his date out loud to his mother was quite the experience: “I can hardly describe her face when you called me ‘something young and malleable’ and ‘a smooth-skinned honey in their 20s’.” Sorry, Mark’s mum.\nMark and Benjamin didn’t opt for a second meeting, but Benjamin is now happily settled with his boyfriend. “We’ve been together four years,” he says. “He’s wonderful, although I’m not sure what score he’d have given me on our first date.”\nBest not to ask, Benjamin.\nMartin and Almaz, June 2017\nMartin said “She was elegant, with a natural brightness and upbeat aura.”\nI said “Elegant is a man’s way of saying a woman is tall and slim without wanting to sound like a judge on Miss World.”\nAlmaz said “I thought he was joking when he said he’s a Cliff Richard fan.”\nI said “That noise you can hear is Almaz’s taxi outside. She called it before Martin even got to the second syllable of ‘Richard’.”\nAlmaz said “Did we go on somewhere? It was a Sunday night, so no.”\nI said “Yes, I am positive the only thing holding you back from a wild pub crawl of the capital’s low joints with Martin was the fact it was a Sunday night. You’re 28!”\nYou could be forgiven for thinking there had been a mix-up, that Almaz and Martin were actually on two different dates. Martin was sweet and kind, perhaps too pure for this world, while Almaz was keen to make it clear he wasn’t her bag – and all credit to her, really, because there is no time for messing on a Blind date.\nReflecting on it now, Almaz admits: “There was definitely no chemistry. Martin wasn’t trying to flirt with me, which really shocked me, because that’s what you want on a date, isn’t it?” Despite some of Almaz’s beautifully withering answers, the date itself wasn’t too bad, she says, and they found plenty to talk about; she admits to a pang of guilt when she realised how different their final scores were. Almaz rated the evening a 6. “I thought he might score me a 7 or 8, so I did feel bad when I saw I got a 10.”\nThe pair didn’t swap numbers – although Almaz wishes she had given hers to the hot waiter after they “shared some intense looks”. The experience may not have found her a boyfriend, but it inspired Almaz creatively: in 2018, she launched her own website, Kayleigh Daniels Dated, writing raunchy dating stories as a fictional character. Now that is a plot twist I wasn’t expecting. “I just really love dating,” she says. “Any chance to go on one, I will take.”\nTom and Emily, October 2016\nThey said “We talked about which supermarket makes the best hummus, the importance of lamps, and Lancaster University, where we both went.”\nI said “I’m calling it right here and now that these two will end up together, for the origin story alone.”\nTom said “In the panic of the hello I forgot Emily’s name.”\nI said “I reckon you could take a look at Emily from across the aisle at your favourite Waitrose and guess she was called Emily, but we’ll let you off, Tom.”\nThey said “We got the number 52 bus (we live just down the road from one another).”\nI said “See? This is a silver-wedding anniversary anecdote waiting to happen. I can practically hear the light thud of grandchildren plonking themselves down into an overstuffed armchair to hear this story.”\nSometimes, when you know, you just know. Tom and Emily’s date was romcom perfect: he accidentally shaved a patch out of his beard that morning and Emily turned up with paint all over her hands. Imagine those little disasters in a montage with Clean Bandit’s Rather Be playing over it.\nTom had left his application email sitting in his drafts for days and says he was stuck in a rut until he hit send. “I felt like this small act of recklessness might snap me out of it.”\nAnd it certainly did. Tom and Emily are still a couple: they have moved in together and adopted “a big ginger cat called Gordon”. By the time their date was published, the pair had been on further dates, but Emily had refused to divulge her answers – or her score – which Tom admits was “slightly worrying”.\nEmily was pleased to discover that Tom awarded her an 8, but felt “simultaneously terrible about the score she gave in return”. Says Tom now: “That 7.5 cut deep.” Emily struggled to answer the “What do you think he made of you?” question. “I knew I was going to struggle to hit the middle ground between totally self-delusional and toe-curlingly falsely modest,” she says.\nThat said, she would definitely recommend the Blind date experience. “At the very least, you’ll have a good anecdote for your next Tinder date.” Both Tom and Emily agree – as do I – that the column needs older couples to apply. “I like the way they approach their answers,” Tom says. “I feel incredibly lucky to have met someone in this strange and slightly terrifying way.”\nJoanne and Morgan, January 2019\nJoanne said “We got kicked out of the house party we crashed. And I left my knickers behind.”\nI said “The LGBTQ crew deliver. They’re taking life in both hands and squeezing it harder than your window cleaner wrings out his chamois.”\nMorgan said “She is obscenely fun.”\nI said “Where would these women be if one of them had said no thanks to that fourth negroni? Home, separately, knickers on. It’s no kind of life.”\nThey said “She’s a 10.”\nI said “It doesn’t matter what happens next. We will always have today – this one perfect, bawdy date, which ended in a fat round 20, with no knickers on. And nobody can take it away from us.”\nIt’s no understatement to say that Joanne and Morgan’s date became the stuff of legend. “I was really quite surprised,” Joanne says now, “because it was just an honest account of a fun night.” She has been reading the column this year and enjoys the “little nods we’ve been getting here and there” from people who have appeared since.\nThey were certainly a hard act to follow: you couldn’t blame subsequent daters for feeling inferior if their own date didn’t end as raucously. Joanne admits that, if she had known she was going to go viral, she might have rethought the outfit: “Morgan was too kind. I was wearing a pink beret, Justin.”\nJoanne, who is bi, despite being tagged a “hilarious millennial lesbian” by fans of the date, enjoyed the positive reaction, but nothing further happened between her and Morgan.\nShe urges all Blind daters to make the most of their moment. “I can’t believe people still do the whole ‘it’s a school night’ thing,” she says. “Guys! It’s free! Free food! Free booze! But what do I know? I’m still single.”\nShe also warns that, if you get Blind-date famous, there is a chance it will follow you for ever. “I’ve had a couple of dates mention it,” she says. “I hope they’re not too scared. I promise them I like to go to the park and just hang out as well. But then, just last night, my date said: ‘Well, there’s been no knickers left behind. Has it been a bad date?’”\nThe answer to that, of course, is yes.\nClick here to find out how this week’s Blind daters, Hannah and Peter, got on.

    "raw_text": "The best part of Owen Willis’s day is his morning shower. Notes of lavender and eucalyptus waft through his private, stone-tiled shower room as he uses a £32 bottle of Cowshed bodywash. He dries off with a fluffy white towel before slathering on Cowshed body lotion (£24).\nThis isn’t Willis’s home, however. It’s his gym. He belongs to Third Space in London, which calls itself a “luxury health club”. Memberships start at £230 a month for an individual site and go as high as £305 for access to all of its branches, including the Mayfair club, where gym-goers can expect “UV-treated fresh air” and “a Himalayan sea-salt walled sauna and steam room”.\nThe 23-year-old, who works in marketing, has been a member since he was 18. He describes it as his “second home”, where he estimates he spends about 22 hours a week. “It’s a massive part of my life,” he says. It is also a massive part of his income: his membership sets him back £279 a month – which, when he started going, was about 10% of his monthly wage.\nWillis is one of the growing number of gen Zs – those aged 13 to 28 – for whom gym membership is an essential part of their monthly outgoings. In the UK, 27% of adults under 25 consider gym membership a necessity, according to a survey by the credit-rating service Intuit Credit Karma. Many young people would rather invest in fitness than spend money on eating out or going clubbing. A survey by the Gym Group, which operates hundreds of gyms across the UK, found 22% of 18- to 24-year-olds spend more than £50 a month on fitness-related memberships and activities, 18% prioritise spending on health and fitness instead of socialising, while 16% place it above going to pubs or restaurants.\nWillis says he has seen a “big shift” among his friends, who go out to dinner less and go to “nicer” gyms instead which, as well as featuring fully kitted gyms and fitness classes, include saunas and steam rooms, massage guns and hydrotherapy pools. “It’s more than a gym,” says Willis. “I go and relax there; I work from there all the time. There’s other stuff, too, like yoga and sound-bath meditation.”\nThe gym has also served as a form of escape from house-sharing. At one point, Willis was living with six people, in a house that had a mouse infestation and only two showers. Damp towels were scattered across the bathroom floor and the shower was crusted with limescale. As a result, he never showered at home. “It was really horrible. Then I’d go to Third Space and the concierge would know my name and give me a fluffy towel when I walked in. If they knew what my apartment was like at the time, they probably would have cancelled my membership,” he jokes.\nThird Space is kitted out with irons, starch spray and even, for an additional cost, a dry-cleaning service. “I don’t own an iron so, if I needed to iron something, I would cycle to the gym and do it there,” says Willis. His use of the gym’s facilities has kept other costs low. He rarely buys toiletries, using the expensive products available in the changing rooms instead, and even though he now lives alone, he still only has a shower at home about once a month.\nThe rise of young gym devotees like Willis mean the luxury gym business is booming. Third Space – which has expanded its number of clubs from one in 2001 to 13 in 2025, with more on the way – saw consumer spending in its gyms rise by 41.1% between December 2023 and December 2024, according to the business consultancy firm CACI. Other chains – including Third Space’s suburban competitor, David Lloyd, where memberships for its flagship locations can set you back £150 a month or more – have also seen soaring growth. A survey by UKActive, the trade body that represents most of Britain’s fitness operators, found that gen Z is the key demographic driving the record numbers of Britons going to the gym.\nThe gyms themselves are also becoming more luxurious. At Lanserhof, the gym at the Arts Club in Mayfair, memberships start at £6,500 a year. Surrenne in Belgravia, central London, charges £10,000 a year for membership, plus a £5,000 joining fee (patrons will apparently experience a “new paradigm for wellbeing”). CPASE in Cheshire, which has been described by Tatler as a “gym more luxurious than any other”, offers “oxygen-enriched air” in its “revolutionary fitness playground” for nearly £4,000 a year. A membership for the fitness facility at Cliveden House, the grand Berkshire manor that was the site of the Profumo affair, will set you back nearly £6,000 a year.\nNiyi Akinseye has been training in the gym for more than 10 years. “It began with me being an overweight and uncomfortable 15-year-old,” he says. “I was very conscious about the way I looked.” The 26-year-old, who works as a regional project lead at a human rights charity, is planning to make a career switch next month to become a full-time fitness coach.\nHe goes to GymBox, which was called one of London’s best luxury gyms by Esquire in 2023. After his membership, £95 a month, and other classes and equipment, Akinseye says he spends about £250 a month on fitness, or 10% of his take-home pay. Akinseye says he has met friends “with similar goals and passions”, and affluent clients for his burgeoning fitness-coaching services. “The more I pay for the gym, the better opportunities I’ve found,” he says.\nAfter being greeted by the receptionist, then handed a fresh towel, with the knowledge a sauna session is just around the corner, he says he “feels happy and like I’m ready to do my work”. He calls fitness a “form of therapy – there’s something very therapeutic about moving your body and finding something you can channel your emotions into”.\nIt is no secret that young people, including gen Z, face big challenges. Akinseye says this was partly why he became interested in fitness. “Seeing the results was very satisfying in a world where there are lots of uncertainties for young people,” he says. “A job isn’t guaranteed in this world, as it perhaps was for previous generations.” Having a gym membership, he says, has helped give him a sense of stability.\nExercise classes have also become more popular with young people. Nishka Parekh, who lives in London, spends about £75 a month on various classes, including pilates. For the 24-year-old marketing manager, fitness is “definitely a social activity”. She says: “Sometimes, me and my friends would plan to go to a workout class on a Friday before going to the pub.”\nWhile she hasn’t gone fully teetotal like many other people her age, Parekh says it’s nice to do something social that “doesn’t revolve around drinking and is better for your health”, physically and mentally. “Fitness definitely helps improve my mental health,” says Parekh. “If I’m having a really rough day at work, or a tough time in general, going to an exercise class or the gym always makes me feel a lot better.”\nWillis feels similarly. “I get more out of it outside of fitness,” he says. “The mental health benefits of going to a nice gym are massive, because you’re surrounded by people who are also more invested in their fitness.”\nUnlike the grotty sweatboxes that once dominated the market (and where many sped through their workouts, eager to leave as soon as possible), luxury gyms are working incredibly hard to keep clients there as long as possible. Third Space’s CEO, Colin Waggett, has said its members should “get the same sort of experience [in our clubs] as in a Firmdale hotel” – referring to the boutique hotel chain. On top of high-end fitness equipment, many Third Space clubs have dedicated workspaces, cafes and wellness centres. In its flagship Canary Wharf branch, members can have botox (starting at £189 for one area) or a Brazilian lymphatic drainage massage (£95 for a 50-minute session).\nAt David Lloyd, as part of a £500m investment in its clubs, the firm announced earlier this year that it was going to add workspaces and spa retreats to a number of locations, to create clubs that, the company says, are places for “me-time, together-time, work, rest and playtime”.\nWillis says scaling back his fitness spending, especially axing his Third Space membership and swapping to a cheaper alternative, is “out of the question”. “I haven’t really thought about moving to a cheaper gym; it’s just never going to be the same,” he says. “I’d probably go once, say: ‘I don’t want to stay here any more,’ and leave.”"

    "raw_text": "Record numbers of Britons are going to the gym, as the desire of many gen Zers to socialise while getting fit instead of drinking in the pub drives an unprecedented surge in membership, a report shows.\nIn all, 11.5 million people aged 16 and over– a new high – now belong to a gym in the UK, a rise of 1.6 million from 2022. It means one in six people have taken out a membership.\nYounger adults are the key demographic behind the boom, according to the report’s authors, UKActive, the trade body that represents most of Britain’s fitness operators.\nThe growth is particularly evident among generation Z – people born between 1997 and 2012, who are between 13 and 28 – who already have a reputation as the healthiest generation ever.\n“[This] is a significant moment as it shows that more people are making a conscious decision to get active in order to improve their physical and often also their mental health,” said Huw Edwards, UKActive’s chief executive.\n“We are witnessing strong demand among all age groups and increasing popularity among gen Z, with health and fitness clubs experiencing growing demand for services such as group exercise, strength training and cardio workouts.\n“Young people are seeing health and fitness as part of their identity and a non-negotiable when it comes to their personal priorities. Many of them are telling us they prefer going to the gym rather than more traditional venues for socialising such as the pub.\n“With the right support, this could become the most health-aware generation ever.”\nThe findings tally with previous reports by Sport England and its “moving communities” research into physical activity that growing numbers of teenagers are taking part in fitness activities.\nA “generational shift” in gym visiting has been taking place in recent years, states the report, which is UKActive’s first in-depth analysis of membership of health and fitness clubs across the UK.\n“Younger generations are demonstrating higher levels of physical activity and gym membership, indicating a shift in societal priorities towards health and wellbeing, and suggesting that for younger people, gym membership is essential.”\nOlder people are the most likely to avoid joining up because they believe they do not need to, “indicating that the positive shift in mindset towards fitness is more prevalent among younger age groups”, the report adds.\nThe findings appear to embellish gen Z’s reputation as having healthier habits and lifestyles than previous generations.\nDavid Minton, the founder of Leisure Database, a specialist fitness market analysis firm, said: “The younger generation are also the healthier generation because they are drinking less alcohol than their predecessors and are much more conscious about what they eat, as evidenced by the increase in veganism, low-sugar diets and consumption of sourdough breads.”\nBut young people may be going for reasons not connected to their health, Minton suggested. “Gen Z are also going to the gym in order to meet a romantic partner and to increase their network of friends because, while they spend a lot of time on social media, the gym offers an in-person experience rather than a virtual experience.\n“For them, gym-going is all about the social element. It’s not about losing weight, because most of them don’t need to.”\nThe value of the UK health and fitness market grew to £5.7bn by last year, while the number of clubs stood at 5,607, which between them saw 616m visits.\nAn increase in lower-cost gyms and those offering access on a pay-as-you-go basis has also helped to increase participation, the report says.\nWhen gym members were asked what motivated them to join, 83% cited improving their physical strength and fitness and 76% said boosting their mental wellbeing, including tackling anxiety and depression. But 75% wanted to improve their confidence and appearance, and 68% to sleep better.\nThe proportion of people in the UK who belong to a gym has risen to 16.9%, one of the highest figures in Europe."

    "raw_text": "In a bright cafe just off Leith Walk in Edinburgh, a group of young people gather around a table strewn with fabric scraps, beads and crochet hooks. Each session brings a new theme: one week it’s crochet, the next jewellery-making, the week after that they learn latte-art. Coffees are sipped, biscuits are passed around and chatter fills the room.\nThis is the Girls Craft Club, founded earlier this year by art history graduate Gabby after a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder left her feeling isolated. “We were all going through life problems,” she says. “We decided to make something beautiful out of it. When you make your own bag or repair your clothes, you value them differently. And you value yourself differently, too.”\nWhat may seem like pure nostalgia is, in fact, part of a wider cultural shift. Across the UK, gen Z is embracing hobbies once more associated with their grandparents or great grandparents: crochet and knitting circles, pottery cafes, mahjong nights and supper clubs that echo Come Dine With Me. These “slow” pastimes are flourishing, not because they are a retro trend being revived, but because they offer something people feel is urgently missing: connection, purpose and respite from digital fatigue.\nThis return to analogue hobbies is happening against a bleak national backdrop. Britain’s teenagers are among the unhappiest in Europe. In its Good Childhood report last year, the Children’s Society warned of a youth happiness recession, with just over 25% of 15-year-olds in the UK reporting low life satisfaction, compared with 7% in the Netherlands.\nFor many who came of age during lockdowns, the need for real-world connection is acute. Nights out are expensive, the cost of living crisis is biting hard, and hours of doomscrolling after working from home have left young people exhausted. Slow hobbies offer a counterweight: affordable, screen-free – and often physical – skills. While some of these are female-led initiatives, the joys of creative community appeal to all. For Carmine Valente, 34, a regular at a pottery cafe in Fulham, west London, pottery painting is one of the only times he fully switches off. “It’s calming and I always leave relaxed – a brilliant way to catch up with mates while doing something creative,” he says.\nThe appeal is multifaceted. Emma, 23, from London, who regularly attends London Creative Gals club, says: “It is about connection and rebuilding community after the isolation of the pandemic, but it’s also about cost, with free events or £10 craft sessions undercutting the price of a night at the pub.”\n“Purpose is another factor,” says Sabah, 24, from Blackburn, who is part of a dog life drawing group. “And the ability to develop practical and creative skills that feel meaningful.” James Chapman agrees: “There’s something so special and unpredictable about dog life drawing. I’ve been many times, drawn many dogs, and it’s the kind of event that always manages to surprise me.”\nA sense of purpose is something Gabby also values: “You get something real, you make genuine connections, and you switch off. Everyone mentions wellbeing and being off phones – it’s a real mental break.” It feels like part of a growing trend, she says, “where being in a new space and doing a creative hobby becomes an accessible and great way to feel connected to people in your area and develop new skills.”\nThe therapeutic benefits of the craft activities themselves are cited as another draw. “The process forces you to slow down, and use your hands in a meditative and repetitive way to do something proactive rather than reactive,” says Sarah P Corbett, founder of the global Craftivist Collective. “Stitch by stitch you regulate your breath, relax your body, and be mindful.” As Daisy Fancourt, a professor of psychobiology at UCL and author of Art Cure, explains: “Gen Z have a proactive focus on mental health, and they recognise the value of these hobbies and the role art plays in regulating biological stress levels.”\nIn Belfast, the search for community has taken the form of supper clubs. When Fiona Fitwi started Cooking With Friends Archives in 2022, she simply wanted to make more friends. She began cooking meals in art galleries and selling tickets for £45 a head, with guests encouraged to bring their own drinks. Groups of 12 to 27 gather to eat, talk and disconnect from technology. “It feels better to pay £45 for a supper club than £50 on a night out you won’t remember,” she says.\nFitwi has been in London over the summer for culinary school. “When I moved, half of my leaving party were people I’d met through Cooking With Friends Archives,” she says. She has now received a grant from Belfast city council to host a free supper club in October, in recognition of the need for accessible community events like hers.\nIn Edinburgh, Gabby’s craft circle offers a similar mix of community with a splash of creativity. “Rotating crafts keeps things fresh,” she says. “It helps people discover new skills, build confidence and connect with others in a safe, supportive environment.” Sessions cost up to £30, though some are free, and participants often leave with two or three pieces of jewellery, stitched bags, or crocheted items.\n“We’ve lost touch with creating,” Gabby says. “When you create something tangible, your confidence grows and you see yourself in a different light.” For many, the screen-free evenings are as important as the skills themselves: small rituals that help people to slow down in a culture that often feels relentlessly fast.\nThe benefits of slow hobbies are not just anecdotal but backed by research. A 2024 survey of more than 7,000 UK adults by Anglia Ruskin University found that arts and crafts produced greater life satisfaction than paid work.\n“With so much of our life being on Zoom, screen-free craft spaces have become medicine for gen Z,” says Corbett. “People love to use their hands for something bigger than themselves and value the time they spend away from phones and computer screens.”\nIn Sheffield, Nottingham and Leeds, artist Liah has found a different way of bringing people together. Her dog life drawing sessions began in 2018, when Sheffield University wanted to host student union events that didn’t revolve around alcohol. Nowadays, these sessions attract about 40 people each week. At about £11 for a two-hour class, they are a cheap evening out and wildly popular with students who miss their pets back home. Some arrive as beginners; others come to rekindle a childhood passion for art. “It’s fun, but also therapeutic,” Liah says. “People come alone and leave with friends.”\nThe Fulham pottery cafe, which opened in 1998, has found unexpected new life with gen Z. Guests can paint ceramics, order a drink from the licensed bar, and spend a few hours creating something lasting. Prices start at £7.95 for a session, plus the cost of a piece, ranging from £6 to £60. “We’ve noticed a real increase in younger visitors since the pandemic,” says Ahmed, who helps run the studio. “You come out feeling as if you have just been to therapy. We host first dates, mates, family reunions. It is a real community hub.”\nIn Manchester, The Read Room is reinventing the book club. Each month, more than 130 people gather in a dimly lit venue as an author reads aloud from their work. Guests receive a free copy of the book, a welcome drink and a goodie bag. Sponsored by car brand Cupra, the event is free to attend. “When do you ever get a full room in Manchester to be totally present and social?” says one guest, Nathan, 28. “This is powerful!”\n“We wanted to make reading sexy again,” say the co-founders Sophia Wild and Kya Buller. “Lots of people loved reading as kids but stopped because it wasn’t seen as cool. Now they’re coming back and engaging with literature again.” The sessions often end with drinks or dancing, but the focus remains on reading, and on creating a community.\n“People don’t go to a run club to run,” says Fitwi from Cooking with Friends Archive. “They go to make friends and have a chat. These hobbies are the same – but they’re also about supporting each other and building community.”\nThe benefits extend beyond individual mood. Fancourt from UCL has identified lots of social benefits of these hobbies: “Whether practised alone or in a group, hobbies such as crochet and knitting become part of your social identity, functioning as a vehicle for reducing loneliness and building community.”\nFor Gabby, these hobbies have become a lifeline. “As life speeds up, we need to actively decide to slow down,” she says. The craft workshops also give participants practical, sustainable skills, helping them learn to repair, create, and treasure what they own – a counterweight to a throwaway culture dominated by fast consumption.\nFrom book clubs to crochet, drawing to pottery, gen Z is building a new social life from old materials. Against the backdrop of a youth mental health crisis, these slow hobbies are more than quaint diversions. They are small acts of resistance against digital exhaustion, isolation and a culture that measures worth in productivity.\nIn the hum of craft and conversation, Britain’s young people are building something important: connection."

    "raw_text": "At this year’s US Open, when 45-year-old tennis great Venus Williams stepped on to the court to play in doubles, it was alongside a teammate who wasn’t even born when Williams won gold in the singles at the Sydney Olympics.\nGiven that the peak performance age for a tennis player has traditionally been considered to be around the mid-20s, it was an extraordinary feat to be competing at a major, but Williams’ exceptional extension of her athletic career is increasingly common.\nThe basketball superstar LeBron James this year made history by being the first NBA player to have played in the league from his teens to his 40s, while last year the Australian basketballer Lauren Jackson defied the odds by competing in her fifth Olympics, aged 43.\nThe 50-year-old Uzbek gymnast Oksana Chusovitina is aiming for her ninth Olympics, and in Japan, Kazuyoshi Miura has broken records by continuing to play elite football – at 58 years old.\nThese achievements are astounding because at an age when most ordinary mortals are starting to feel the effects of declining muscle mass, reaction times, cognition and stamina, these elite athletes are still performing extraordinary physical feats that put incredible pressure and stress on their ageing bodies. Furthermore, they are doing so in a sporting environment that has continued to push the boundaries of what the unenhanced body can achieve, well beyond what was thought possible, or even safe, just a few decades ago.\nSo what does it take to be able to keep leaping about a court or charging down a field at an age when many other elite athletes have called it a day and when most non-athletes are happy if they don’t slip over in the shower?\nThe extraordinary longevity of these elite athletes is down to a mix of genetics, environment and lifestyle, according to associate Prof Christina Ekegren, a physiotherapist and researcher at Monash University in Melbourne.\nThe Williams sisters, for example, no doubt have great genes, but they have also made the most of them. “The thing about Venus and Serena is that they’ve been training at a very high level from a very young age, so they’re starting out at a very high base level of fitness and strength,” Ekegren says. The younger of the two sisters retired at 40 after a stellar career that spanned decades, but her older sister Venus is still going strong, becoming the oldest competitor to play singles at the US Open this year.\n“What differentiates some of the athletes that you’re talking about is they’re very smart in their approach to healthy ageing as an athlete,” says sports and exercise physiotherapist Ben Herde at Grand Slam Physiotherapy in Melbourne.\nOne of the normal processes of ageing is sarcopenia, or the gradual loss of muscle mass. It happens as a result of changes in hormones, in activity levels, in nutrition and in the muscle structure itself. But it’s not necessarily inevitable, and Herde says there’s increasing emphasis on strength training for older athletes, specifically to combat this decline. “If you compare that to someone who’s not training versus training, just that increased muscle mass will obviously give not only increased power and function, but it will offset the loads that go through the cartilage and the bones and even the neural structures,” he says.\nLike most things age-related, it’s a case of “use it or lose it”, Herde says. Elite older athletes are able to keep doing what they do because they don’t stop and let themselves decline.\nAthletes who compete for decades also adapt to their changing bodies. They may be more selective about the competitions they enter, or play a different position on the field that exposes them to less risk of damage or demands less of them physically. “If you look at it like Australian rules football, they might have been a really dynamic, hard-running midfielder, and then as they become older, they’ll put themselves into the forward line where there’s less running,” Herde says.\nBut older athletes aren’t invincible. Despite their carefully maintained strength, agility, body condition and skill, they do inevitably face a greater risk of injury as they age and, like the rest of us, those injuries take longer to heal. Part of remaining at the elite level in older age is taking more time to allow for a proper recovery both from injury and normal training, says Prof Jeremiah Peiffer, professor of exercise science at Murdoch University in Perth.\n“A lot of this longevity within sport is because people are able to give the time necessary to recovery,” Peiffer says. “The more time you can give to recovery, the more time you’re not running around doing other stuff, the more likely your body’s going to adapt appropriately.” For example, football star Cristiano Ronaldo, who is still playing at 40, specifically credits scheduled recovery sessions as key to his longevity and achievement, according to Men’s Health.\nWhile elite older athletes are doing all the things the rest of us hear on a regular basis from our doctors and physios – eat well, stay active – they do pay a price for taking that healthy advice to the extreme.\n“The paradox to that is that there are a number of things that come with prolonged lifetime high-volume training that can be a bit detrimental as well,” Peiffer says. Elite athletes, particularly those who participate in endurance sports, have a significantly higher risk of irregular heart rhythms in middle age. And there are increased risks of musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, especially in athletes who have experienced knee injuries.\nDespite the risks and challenges, Ekegren says, it’s important to see older people still excelling on the sports field, and to inspire the rest of us to put a little more effort into keeping up our physical activity.\n“We have this stigma in society that we can’t achieve to the same extent as we get older,” she says. “But I think that’s really untrue, and I think it really all comes down to how much you’re doing in your daily life.”\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Venus Williams will take the court on Monday night for her record-extending 25th US Open singles appearance, the Here We Go Again meme brought to life, quite literally as enduring a part of the Flushing Meadows iconography as Arthur Ashe Stadium itself. At 45, two years removed from her last grand slam match and ranked No 610 in the world, she will face Karolína Muchová, the Czech 11th seed and 2023 French Open runner-up who has twice reached the semi-finals in New York.\nIf the scale of the task before her is formidable, so too is the symbolism of her presence. Williams is the oldest singles competitor at America’s national championships since Renée Richards 44 years ago. She made her debut here as a 17-year-old in 1997 – the same year Ashe was completed and replaced Armstrong as the tournament’s main stadium – becoming the first unseeded player in the Open era to reach the final before losing to Martina Hingis. Twenty-eight years later, she returns with her place in history long since assured but her taste for the fight undiminished.\nShe’s the winner of seven grand slam singles titles – five at Wimbledon, two at the US Open – to go with 14 doubles crowns alongside her younger sister. She has been world No 1 in singles and doubles, won four Olympic gold medals and brought in roughly $43m in prize money with countless more from endorsements and outside endeavors. Given her preposterous longevity and pan-cultural resonance, it would not be hyperbolic to call her one of the five most famous active sportspeople on the planet. Nothing left to prove came and went sometime during the George W Bush years.\nYet here she is again, after a 16-month hiatus that included surgery for uterine fibroids and long spells of doubt. She returned in July at the Washington Open where she drew overflow crowds that included NBA star Kevin Durant and knocked off Peyton Stearns, the world No 35. It offered a flicker of the old fire, a reminder that her classic first-strike game – big serve, flat drives, all-court aggression – still has teeth.\nOff the court, the comeback has coincided with a new chapter in her personal life. Williams confirmed last month that she is engaged to the Italian actor-producer Andrea Preti, crediting him with encouraging her through the grind of training and recovery. “My fiancé is here and he really encouraged me to keep playing,” she said after the win over Stearns, which made her the oldest player to win a tour-level singles match since Martina Navratilova in 2004. “There were so many times where I just wanted to coast and kind of chill. … He encouraged me to get through this and it’s wonderful to be here.”\nThe couple had kept their relationship largely private until recently, but their public appearances together – from boating on the Amalfi Coast to Milan Fashion Week earlier this year – added a different kind of spotlight to Williams’s return. For a player who once deftly volleyed questions about settling down, it has marked a shift in tone.\nFor much of the past two years many assumed Venus had quiet-quit from the tour. Serena’s high-profile farewell in Vogue in 2022, followed by the exits of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova, seemed the bookend to an era. But Venus, despite quipping last month that she’d only come back to tennis for the health insurance, never embraced that narrative. “I think I’ll always play tennis,” she said on Saturday. “It’s in my DNA. So it doesn’t matter if it’s now or 30 years from now … tennis will always be one of the most important parts of my life.”\nEven by the standards of sport’s greatest methuselahs – think Jaromir Jagr, Bernard Hopkins, Tom Brady – Williams is built different. None of the 609 players above her in the rankings have made it to their 40s yet, much less 45. And only a small fraction of them were even alive when Williams made her professional debut at the Bank of the West Classic back in 1994, when Pulp Fiction was in theaters and Boyz II Men ruled the US charts.\nThat sense of permanence helps explain why she continues. “I haven’t thought about what people would take away from it,” she said. “I just mostly think about what I would get from it.”\nShe has more than earned the right. Since bursting through the gates of a lily-white sport alongside her sister, Williams has borne the twin burdens of racism and sexism with unflinching grace. She led the campaign for equal prize money at Wimbledon and Roland Garros. She inspired a generation of Black American players, including Coco Gauff, Sloane Stephens, Taylor Townsend and Hailey Baptiste.\nHer presence this week also coincides with the 75th anniversary of Althea Gibson’s debut at the US national championships, another reminder of the lineage she extends. “Althea accomplished so much, and a lot of it has not been given the credit it deserves,” Williams said. “The most important part is just shining light on it and acknowledging that.”\nPeers have been quick to stress her wider importance over the past few days. “She’s one of the best athletes of all time,” said Frances Tiafoe. “Her and her sister, they’re not only great for the women’s game, not only great for women’s sports, but they are so iconic.” Naomi Osaka added: “I don’t really like how every headline mentions her age … it’s more the broader significance, how much of a legend she is.”\nIt is easy to romanticize her return, but the margins are unforgiving. Since improbably reaching the Australian Open and Wimbledon finals in 2017, then re-establishing herself as a fixture in the WTA’s top 10 during her age-38 season, her activity and results have tapered off. She has not won a match at the US Open since 2019. Wildcard invitations into the main draw, including the one that brought her here, inevitably provoke debate about whether they should go to younger players. And her opponent Muchová, with her variety and shot-making intelligence, is precisely the kind of player who punishes rust. A win, frankly, would qualify as a major upset.\nWilliams is realistic about those stakes, but her humor remains as sharp as her fashion instincts. “Hit it too hard, it goes out,” she said when asked to assess her current form. “So I’m going to try to hit less hard so it goes in. But the good news is I’m having fun controlling the points. It’s a great game style for me.”\nAmong the staunchest defenders of the USTA’s decision to award Williams a wildcard has been the retired American star Andy Roddick, who took the critics to task after Friday’s draw was revealed.\n“I don’t care if she goes out and doesn’t win a single game, we should be full of gratitude for having had Venus Williams in our game,” the 2003 US Open champion said on his podcast. “[The critics say] they are taking it away from someone who’s deserving. If you are deserving, you don’t need a wildcard. Simply, you have qualified on your own ranking.\n“It’s not an entitlement, it’s a gift. You’re telling me as a tennis tournament, that Venus Williams is not deserving as a gift from the US Open? Shut up, get out of here. She has been a gift to us, it’s not the other way around.”\nAs a PlayStation-era carryover in a PS5 world, Williams’s stated goals are less about winning majors than about process, self-belief and the thrill of competing. “I want to be my best, and that’s the expectation I have for myself,” she said. “I haven’t played as much as the other players, so it’s a different challenge. I’m just trying to have fun, stay relaxed, and be my personal best.”\nThose sentiments echoed her remarks from DC last month: “There are no limits for excellence. It’s all about what’s in your head and how much you’re able to put into it. If you put in the work mentally, physically and emotionally, then you can have the result. It doesn’t matter how many times you fall down. Doesn’t matter how many times you get sick or get hurt or whatever it is. If you continue to believe and put in the work, there is space for you.”\nWhether this is her farewell to Flushing Meadows or merely another chapter in her long goodbye, Williams has no interest in scripting ahead. She will not trail it in a glossy magazine, nor invite anyone else to interpret it for her. When the time comes, she may simply slip through the side door, like another New York icon: Excuse me while I disappear.\nFor now she has at least one more night on Ashe, one more chance to swing freely under the lights of her sport’s largest stage. “Super thrilling to be back,” she said. “It does not get old. It just gets more exciting.”"

    "raw_text": "‘Far from being a rock or island … it turns out that the best metaphor to describe the human body is ‘sponge’. We’re permeable,” write Rick Smith and Bruce Lourie in their book Slow Death By Rubber Duck: The Secret Danger of Everyday Things. While the permeability of our cells is key to being alive, it also means we absorb more potentially harmful substances than we realise.\nStudies have found a number of chemical residues in human breast milk, urine and water systems. Many of them are endocrine disruptors, which can interfere with the body’s natural hormones. “They can mimic, block or otherwise disrupt normal hormone function, leading to adverse health effects,” says Dr Shanna Swan, professor of environmental medicine and reproductive health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. We (often unknowingly) ingest, inhale or otherwise absorb them, and while toxicity depends on dosage, the reality is that a lot of us are exposed to them daily.\nSo what to do about it? There are apps that will give you information about the ingredients in products, such as Yuka, Think Dirty and EWG’s Healthy Living, but there are some key “nasties” worth knowing about. Because science is always evolving, navigating these issues can be tricky – even for the experts. That’s why many specialists recommend looking at your overall lifestyle and habits, rather than fixating on individual substances in isolation. The list that follows is far from exhaustive, but it highlights 15 ingredients that science suggests may pose risks to our health.\nCosmetics\nPhthalates\nThis group of chemicals is found in fragrances, plastic (including children’s toys) and other cosmetics and personal care products – such as hairspray and nail polish. Some phthalates are deemed endocrine disruptors “linked to preterm birth, fertility issues, early puberty and some cancers”, says Alexa Friedman, a senior scientist at non-profit health organisation Environmental Working Group. Swan adds that they can lower testosterone levels and increase our oestrogenic response, in turn affecting sperm, egg health and fertility, and increasing the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. While some are considered safer than others at low doses, many are still linked with negative health concerns and/or are currently under-researched.\nTo reduce exposure, avoid vague “fragrance” labels and ingredients ending in “phthalate”, such as dibutyl phthalate or diethyl phthalate. Brands such as Ilia, Westman Atelier, Refy, Merit Beauty, Weleda, Olaplex, Charlotte Tilbury and Paula’s Choice avoid using them, but if in doubt check the EWG’s Skin Deep cosmetics database to learn exactly what’s in every formula you use.\nParabens\nUsed as preservatives in makeup, skincare, haircare and some processed food, parabens extend shelf life and prevent microbial growth. Long-chain parabens, such as propylparaben, butylparaben and isobutylparaben, are endocrine disruptors that mimic oestrogen and “may contribute to hormonal imbalances, reproductive harm, asthma, allergies, obesity and possibly hormone-sensitive cancers later in life”, says Dr Federica Amati, head nutritionist at Zoe, the personalised nutrition app.\nThough some argue low doses are safe, many brands now offer paraben-free options. Look to Drunk Elephant, The Ordinary, Paula’s Choice, Tata Harper and Living Proof, as well as most CeraVe and La Roche-Posay formulas too.\nFragrance\nThey may smell good, but many fragrance chemicals are phthalates or volatile compounds that release gas into the air. Often not fully disclosed on labels, they can trigger allergies and disrupt hormones, says Amati. One example, Lilial (butylphenyl methylpropional) was widely used in cosmetics until it was banned in the UK and EU in 2022. “Beware of ingredient lists that use the words ‘fragrance’ or ‘parfum’ as they can hide phthalates and other chemicals,” advises Amati. Opt for fragrance-free skincare (Avène and Dermatica do great formulas, while Bioderma’s Sensibio and La Roche-Posay’s Toleriane lines are also good options) and haircare (such as Philip Kingsley’s No Scent No Colour shampoo) and again, always read the label.\nFormaldehyde or formaldehyde-releasers\n“Used in nail and hair products as preservatives, formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and can cause respiratory irritation and skin allergies, while formaldehyde-releasing preservatives are associated with adverse skin reactions,” says Friedman. Black and Latino women, who often use hair relaxers, face higher exposure and potentially health risks over time.\nFor safer haircare options, try formaldehyde-free keratin treatments from brands such as Kerasilk and Cezanne. Nail strengtheners – at home or in salon – often contain formaldehyde, so check before use, although BIAB and CND Shellac are formaldehyde-free. As well as formaldehyde itself, watch out for ingredients such as DMDM hydantoin, diazolidinyl urea, quaternium-15 and sodium hydroxymethylglycinate, which can also be found in self-tanners, makeup products such as blush, mascara, concealer and foundation, shampoo and conditioner, and skincare formulas too.\nOxybenzone\nOxybenzone, a chemical filter in some sunscreens, is an endocrine disruptor and harmful to coral reefs. Cosmetic biochemist Nausheen Qureshi explains that it is absorbed by the skin and converts UVA rays to prevent damage – its intended function – but there are nonetheless concerns about (and ongoing research into) its impact on our health. It may potentially affect our thyroid and reproductive hormones, and affect kidney and immune system function. Friedman recommends looking for EWG-verified sunscreens, which avoid harmful ingredients such as oxybenzone, but brands such as Medik8 offer effective and safe options too. Mineral sunscreens that utilise zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are a good alternative because they sit on the skin and reflect UV light (without absorption) instead.\nFood\nArtificial sweeteners\n“Artificial sweeteners, like sucralose and saccharin, can disrupt gut microbiota and impair glucose metabolism, potentially leading to metabolic disorders like diabetes,” says Amati. These low-calorie sugar substitutes are often found in products that are labelled “diet” or “sugar-free”. Studies also link intake with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and unnecessary appetite stimulation. When buying supermarket products, be wary of low-sugar marketing claims and prioritise eating whole foods (raspberries are a great high-fibre, low-sugar snack) over processed foods and diet drinks. Swap fizzy beverages (which are often full of artificial sweeteners) for Dalston’s Soda or Momo’s raw and unfiltered kombucha, which is also great for gut health.\nHigh-fructose corn syrup\nHigh-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a sweetener commonly found in processed foods, fizzy drinks, sweets, sauces, breakfast cereals, baked goods and even certain yoghurts and flavoured dairy products in the UK, and especially in the US. It is inflammatory, “disrupts the metabolism and contributes to insulin resistance, blood sugar instability, obesity and type 2 diabetes,” says Rhian Stephenson, nutritionist, naturopath and founder of Artah, which sells supplements and nutrition programmes. “It also offers little nutritional value and negatively affects energy levels, hormones and metabolic health.”\nIn the UK, HFCS may appear on labels as glucose-fructose syrup or isoglucose, but elsewhere it goes by other names, such as maize syrup. Stephenson advises reading full ingredient lists, “not just the front label, because marketing claims – such as ‘natural’ or ‘low fat’ – can be misleading,” she says. “In fact, they are usually a warning sign.” For some extra assistance, Amati recommends the Zoe processed food risk scale, a science-backed tool that offers guidance on what’s in processed foods. Ultimately, cooking whole foods at home is the best way to avoid HFCS and similar additives.\nEmulsifiers\nWidely used to improve the texture and shelf life of packaged foods, emulsifiers have “been shown (in animal studies) to cause gut inflammation and glucose intolerance, and many worsen intestinal diseases like ulcerative colitis”, says Amati. It is found in products such as ice-cream, mayonnaise, chocolate, packaged bread and oat milk (common examples include polysorbate 80, carboxymethyl cellulose or CMC and carrageenan). Emulsifier-free supermarket buys include Jason’s Sourdough (which also doesn’t contain sweeteners), Plenish’s Oat Milk, Yeo Valley’s Organic Vanilla Ice-Cream and Kallo’s Belgian Milk Chocolate Organic Rice Cake Thins. While currently deemed safe in small amounts, emulsifiers are worth watching as research in humans evolves.\nNitrites\nWhether it’s bacon, salami or hotdogs, most processed meats are preserved using nitrites. These can form carcinogenic nitrosamines in the body, and have been scientifically linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer, rates of which are rising globally. The World Health Organization advises limiting intake, and to be particularly wary of heating them above 130C, which is when nitrosamines can form – and have been linked to stomach and bowel cancer.\nArtificial food dyes\nArtificial food dyes are added to food and drink to create specific colours. While the most concerning culprits – red 3 (E127) and red 40 (E129) – are no longer widely used in the UK, some are, including ponceau 4R (E124), sunset yellow (E110), quinoline yellow (E104), carmoisine (E122) and tartrazine (E102), but hold Food Standards Agency warnings. They are still considered safe overall, but are linked to “neuroinflammation [potentially leading to diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s], hormone disruption and behavioural issues such as hyperactivity and attention difficulties, especially in sensitive individuals like children,” says Stephenson. “There are concerns about their impact on developing brains and nervous systems.”\nYou’ll find them in some fizzy drinks, sweets, canned fruit, jellies, mushy peas, ready meals and products imported from the US, including various sweets. Most food companies in the UK now avoid them. However, if they are used, it is a legal requirement that the products carry a warning (“may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children”), so check the label.\nTrans fats\nTrans fats – especially those that are artificially made – raise LDL (bad) and lower HDL (good) cholesterols, and are linked to chronic inflammation and heart disease. They can also “disrupt hormone balance, impair insulin sensitivity, and affect everything from mood and metabolism to fertility and menstrual health,” says Stephenson. Found in ultraprocessed foods, such as frozen pizza, chips, doughnuts, cakes and margarine, they also contribute to the unhealthy visceral fat that builds up around key organs such as the liver and intestines, which raises inflammation and increases the risk of a number of diseases. If “partially hydrogenated oil” is listed on the label, take it as an immediate red flag, while interesterified fats, hydrogenated vegetable oil and shortening (a type of fat used to create crumbly pastry) are other warning signs, says Stephenson.\nKitchen\nPfas\nOwn a Teflon pan? Then you will have encountered Pfas (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), a family of “forever chemicals” that are in some non-stick coatings. They are also used for water- or smudge-resistance in cosmetics, textiles and outdoor clothing. “Pfas degrade incredibly slowly,” explains Jonatan Kleimark, head of corporate sustainability at ChemSec. This allows them to build up in the body and the environment, which is worrying as they are carcinogenic and can disrupt our hormones, reduce immune function and cause reproductive issues.\nTo avoid them, swap non-stick pans for carbon, ceramic or stainless steel: brands such as Our Place and Le Creuset offer highly Instagrammed, Pfas-free pots and pans. Many brands now make it clear that their products are Pfas-free, so keep an eye out. In makeup and skincare, beware of ingredients that feature “fluor” somewhere in their name (see: perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), especially if they are in long-wear or waterproof products as these are often Pfas, says Kleimark.\nBPA\nAn industrial chemical used to make rigid plastics, bisphenol A (or BPA) is a “well-studied endocrine disruptor associated with hormone-sensitive diseases (such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, ovarian, breast, prostate and thyroid cancers and postpartum depression) and metabolic disorders,” says Amati. It also affects cognitive function and raises risk of obesity. Like Pfas, it accumulates in the body over time, increasing long-term disease risk. Research in 2020 found BPA in the urine of 92% of adults in 11 European countries.\nThough Tupperware is BPA-free, the substance is still found in many plastic containers, refillable drinks bottles and tin can linings. (The EU banned it in food-contact materials in 2025, but the UK has not done the same.) To avoid it, switch to glass containers (VonShef and Pyrex are good options), buy BPA-free water bottles, such as Ocean Bottle, and look for a “BPA-free” label on cans. If the can’s recycling code is 3 or 7 (see the green triangle), chances are it contains a BPA lining.\nTriclosan\nThere are a number of ingredients in cleaning products that can affect human health. Triclosan, an antimicrobial agent that’s linked to oxidative stress, hormone disruption and genotoxicity (the ability to damage our genes), is worth avoiding. Brands such as Dr Bronner, Method and Ecover offer triclosan-free formulas.\nVOCs\nVolatile organic compounds (VOCs), found in ingredients such as denatured alcohol (meths) and some fragrances, are linked to cancer and respiratory issues. Choose fragrance-free cleaning products, such as those from Purdy & Figg, Kit & Kin and Bio-D, which avoid triclosan, parabens and other concerning chemicals, as well as formulas such as M&S’s Sensitive Multi-Surface Cleaner and The Lab Co’s Fragrance Free Washing Up Liquid."

    "raw_text": "Most of my adult life has revolved around music: clubs, bars, festivals, house parties – anywhere I could dance to loud music. I loved how energising and cathartic it was to get immersed in it, to lose myself a little and move my body expressively without judgment. I’d get so absorbed that I would lose track of time; once, at Burning Man, I was awake for 36 hours exploring the festival, meeting new people and partying.\nWhen I became a DJ, these kinds of events increased. Late nights out would last until the morning. Often, they became marathon weekend sessions, which ran from Friday night to Sunday lunchtime. It wasn’t all dancing and shenanigans – there would be moments to sit around and chat with people, too. I’d be out at least three times a week. Even though I’d get tired, I would always find some way to push through to the early hours because I was scared to miss out on things. Fomo (fear of missing out) drove many of my decisions.\nMy work never suffered but my mental health did. I started to feel anxious and dangerously close to burnout. Consumed with self-loathing, I wanted to stop but couldn’t figure out how – until I went on a 10-day silent meditation course.\nIt was then that I realised the life I was living was unsustainable. But it took a while to unravel my hedonism and habitual indulgence. I went sober because I wanted to rid myself of the brain fog and fatigue I was often bogged down with.\nLearning to navigate nights out without a crutch to keep me going sparked an important shift in my approach to parties and festivals. Instead of giving in to Fomo, I have learned to listen to what my body is telling me rather than ignoring the signs. Tired legs usually spark a well-earned sit down or, in some cases, I will call it a night and get myself home to bed. This kind of behaviour was unheard of between the ages of 17 and 37, when I had my last drink. Back then, I would keep going even when I was exhausted.\nIt hasn’t been easy, though. Being sober is hard work. Not having an easy escape can be very challenging. I had to learn how to be more confident and expressive without ingesting anything. Dancing while sober is still fun but it’s tricky dealing with how self-conscious you feel.\nResponding to my body’s needs consciously and waving goodbye to Fomo have given me a real sense of stability. Every time I’ve made the decision to have an early night or given myself time to rest has reinforced my self-respect and self-love. The gradual accumulation of healthy decisions has been life-changing for me. The dancefloor has been my sanctuary for a long time. Now I can happily get my fill and go home when the time is right, without ever feeling as if I’m missing out. That peace of mind is priceless."

    "raw_text": "It is April 2022 and I am standing in the middle of the stage at Cadogan Hall in London. As the pianist plays a plucky staccato intro, it dawns on me that I am about to sing the West Side Story classic I Feel Pretty, with choreography, in front of a packed audience, alongside 200 gay men.\nThis was my first time performing with the London Gay Men’s Chorus (LGMC) – Europe’s largest gay choir. I first saw them perform years earlier in Soho, where they sang Bridge Over Troubled Water at a vigil for the Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida in 2016. After making it through the pandemic, the chorus’s years-long waiting list and months of rehearsals, I was under the bright stage lights, trying to remember the first line of the song and thinking: “what have I got myself into?”\nIn some ways, the LGMC came into my life at the perfect time. I had recently gone freelance and I missed the upsides of having colleagues: gossip, after-work drinks and trivial office grudges. Looking back to my first rehearsal, when I had to wear a name tag to identify myself, I couldn’t have predicted how many friends I would make, often with people I wouldn’t have encountered in my social circle. One of my choir besties, Bradley, was raised as a Mormon in Utah. Our upbringings were different, but being two gay guys who love to sing the high notes transcends cultural barriers. On the gossip front, there were petty rivalries and microscandals worthy of a Ryan Murphy TV drama – it’s a gay choir, after all.\nWhen I joined the choir, my biggest fear wasn’t the singing, but putting myself out there. After spending most of the pandemic staring at a screen, I had become jaded by the cynicism that underpins so many online interactions, where being seen to care about anything is “cringe”. But it turns out that once you have performed a fully choreographed version of Spice Up Your Life – assembled on the stage in a Geri Halliwell-inspired union jack formation – that fear rapidly disappears.\nOnce I abandoned my cringe complex, it suddenly became much more fun to live out my Glee Club fantasy. Over the past four years, I’ve performed at venues including the Royal Albert Hall and Alexandra Palace. I marched in the 2022 parade marking 50 years of London Pride. I have travelled to Italy to sing in a Pitch Perfect-style convention with hundreds of queer choirs from across the world. (Yes, this is a real thing.) I have been part of a 200-person rainbow Pride flag on the stage. These moments have not only helped me to feel less self-conscious, but they have also taught me that the things that bring us joy are never frivolous – even camp show tunes and sparkles.\nLast April, the LGMC gathered in Soho – just a few streets away from where I first heard them perform. We sang Erasure’s queer anthem A Little Respect, to mark the 25th anniversary of the Admiral Duncan pub bombing. It was a testament to the power of being seen – and heard – for who you really are. As a small part of something much bigger, that is how joining a gay choir has made me feel. And I am reminded of that every time I step on to the stage, wearing a ridiculous glittery costume and once again thinking: “what have I got myself into?”"

    "raw_text": "It’s farm-to-fork dining at its freshest. I’m sitting at a vast outdoor table in Herefordshire looking out over rows of vines. On the horizon, the Malvern Hills ripple towards the Black Mountains; in front of me is a selection of local produce: cheeses from Monkland Dairy, 6 miles away, salad leaves from Lane Cottage (8 miles), charcuterie from Trealy Farm (39 miles), cherries from Moorcourt Farm (3 miles), broccoli quiche (2 miles) and glasses of sparkling wine, cassis and apple juice made just footsteps away. This off-grid feast is the final stop on White Heron Estate’s ebike farm tour – and I’m getting the lie of the land with every bite.\nBefore eating, our small group pedalled along a two-hour route so pastorally pretty it would make Old MacDonald sigh. Skirting purple-hued borage fields, we’ve zipped in and out of woodland, down rows of apple trees and over patches of camomile, and learned how poo from White Heron’s chickens is burnt in biomass boilers to generate heat. “Providing habitats for wildlife is important, but we need to produce food as well,” says our guide Jo Hilditch, who swapped a career in PR for farming when she inherited the family estate 30 years ago.\nThe tours offer an immersive way of seeing British agriculture in action. Pausing in the estate’s blackcurrant fields, Jo pulls bottles of chilled Ribena from a basket for us to drink (White Heron produces 5% of Ribena’s blackcurrant supply) and encourages us to taste the fruit: fat and sweet, the berries are a whole different entity to the wincingly sharp little beads growing in my own garden.\nSo lyrical do I wax about the blackcurrants that, after I arrive at my accommodation for the night, the estate’s homely Field Cottage, there’s a knock at the door: the delivery of a punnet to take home. I add it to the cottage’s guest hamper, which is brimming with tangy Worcester Hop cheese, local raspberries, some of the estate’s own apple juice and a miniature of its treacly, sharp-sweet cassis.\nI don’t have to worry about working it off. The following day I’m back on the ebike on a new self-guided ride around north Herefordshire. One of a handful of routes the estate has curated around the region’s farm shops, cider-makers, cheese producers and farm-to-fork restaurants, the trails link up some delectable pit stops in different corners of the county, some of which feature on Visit Herefordshire’s new food safaris.\nSetting out while the early morning mist is still loitering over the estate’s orchards, I swing over an old grass-covered railway line on to a quiet lane running between fields of hay, then wheel along to pretty Pembridge, with its rows of tipsy-angled black-and-white buildings. As if by arrangement, the bells start ringing from the church’s stand-alone belfry as I pass, giving the impression of a medieval rocket about to launch. I stop in the village stores to pick up a loaf from Peter Cooks Bread and a coffee at Bloom & Grind before pedalling on to Eardisland.\nThe mist lifts as I arrive, revealing a picturesque swirl of half-timbered buildings, a dainty 17th-century dovecote and an elegant bridge over the River Arrow. There’s no time to dawdle, though. I’m only partway into my 29-mile route and it’s mid-morning already.\nI cycle down blissfully empty lanes to Monkland Dairy, set up three decades ago by ex-teacher Kaz Hindle and her husband, Mark. Having “bought a cheese shop because of a drunken dinner”, Kaz tells me the dairy came about when one of the shop’s employees mentioned her grandmother’s 1917 recipe for cheese. The grandmother turned out to be Ellen Yeld, one-time “chief dairy instructress” for Herefordshire, so the recipe was a good one. The Hindles refined it further to produce Little Hereford, a cheddar-like cheese that’s now the dairy’s flagship product.\nWith Kaz semi-retired, the cheesemaking side of things has been taken over by ex-chef and former customer Dean Storey. Showing me the cheese cave and the dairy’s vintage cast-iron presses, Storey tells that me he makes 30 to 40 Little Herefords a week and up to 300 of the dairy’s deliciously creamy blue monks, plus some “more controversial” cheeses such as ones featuring garlic and chive; “My kids love it in pasta,” he says.\nResisting the urge to order the cafe’s signature ploughman’s, I hop back on my bike. Lunch beckons a few fields further on. The Riverside at Aymestrey is a pretty black-and-white inn beside the River Lugg. The hillside above it operates as a semi-wild kitchen garden. Among a bounty of damsons, cobnuts, jerusalem artichokes, fennel, lovage, kale, gooseberries and apples are pigs and chickens. “The garden started as a lockdown project and now we have 2.5 acres (1 hectare),” says chef-patron Andy Link, as he shows me around. “It means we can work in food metres rather than food miles.”\nI’m transported back to the garden when I bite into an appetiser of summer veg croustade – a mouthful of crunchy peas, beans and mint enveloped with crushed seeds. It’s followed by trout cured in gin and lemon verbena, with gooseberries and tendrils of sea purslane, then fall-apart local beef fillet and cheek from a farm 11 miles away. But it’s the dainty, cloud-like savarin I have for dessert that keeps this hyper-Herefordshire meal on my mind as I wobble back on to my bike for the ride back to White Heron; it’s soaked in a delicate syrup flavoured with pine tips.\nThe following morning, I do some foraging of my own, driving south to Longtown to meet wild food expert Liz Knight, of Forage Fine Foods, on her local patch. As we walk out along an old drovers’ road to the fields past her converted barn, Liz teaches me to look at the landscape not just as a view but as a foodscape. There may be an extraordinary panorama of the Cat’s Back hill across the valley, but we try to keep our eyes down: beneath our feet is pineapple weed, whose fruity flowers can be used to top salads or spice up cordials, broadleaf plantain, which can be fried like kale chips, and docks, whose ground seeds can be baked in bread and crackers.\nAt one point, we come across an ancient linden tree, whose colossal gnarled trunk makes it a contender for the real-life Magic Faraway Tree, though Liz says that its real sorcery lies in its cucumber-scented flowers; delicious on salads, they are also said to help calm the nervous system. Nearby is a patch of yarrow. A forager’s cure-all, yarrow’s many medicinal properties include calming bites and stings, balancing hormones and soothing sore throats. Picking a few heads, we stroll back to Liz’s kitchen to steep the flowers with honeysuckle in vodka to use as a tincture.\nBack home that evening, I make a salad using radishes, runner beans and soft dorstone cheese from the Oakchurch Farm Shop, another pin on Herefordshire’s food safari map. As I slice the veg, I think of everyone I’ve met over the last few days. Seeing such careful tending of food first-hand has left me not just with the lie of the land, I realise, but with the experience of truly savouring it too.\nThe trip was provided by White Heron; its two- to three-hour ebike farm tour and tasting is £50pp; full-day slow cycle rides £80pp; self-catering accommodation sleeps four, from £509 for three nights. Half-day foraging courses with Liz Knight from £55pp. For more information see visitherefordshire.co.uk"

    "raw_text": "You couldn’t make it up. As early autumn darkness deepened around Whistlewood Common – tealights a-flicker, guitars twanging around the campfire – I found myself sitting between Peter Wood and Gill Forrester. It was a pincer movement of nominative determinism: Wood, a woodworker and teacher of heritage crafts; Forrester, community and wellbeing manager at the National Forest. Both – along with members of the Whistlewood community – were singing the praises of planting trees.\nThe National Forest is the Midlands’ great rewilding. In 1991 this ambitious environmental project launched to green-up an area of 200 square miles and connect the remnants of two ancient forests: Needwood in Staffordshire and Charnwood in Leicestershire. Back then, scarred by years of coal mining and clay extraction, this was one of the least-wooded parts of Britain – only 6% forest-covered. But in summer 2024, having planted 9.5m trees, the National Forest hit 25%.\nWhistlewood, 4 hectares (10 acres) of formerly fallow farmland near the town of Melbourne, was bought by a local social enterprise in 2013, with the support of the National Forest, Whistlewood’s director Graham Truscott tells me. Now, it’s been planted with 3,500 trees, and offers a mix of spaces for different activities, from food cultivation to yoga to forest school.\nI joined one of Whistlewood’s regular community feasts, a tasty spread of curries and foraged mushrooms and allotment salads, while on a short break exploring the area with National Forest E-bike Holidays. Truscott had contacted owner Sue Jerham to say if she had any clients riding through he would love to host them. It’s this level of on-the-ground knowledge that makes Jerham’s bespoke itineraries special, and it was also, I soon discovered, typical of the National Forest, which aims to build relationships and bring people together, as well as plant saplings.\nI had started ebiking that morning at Hicks Lodge, one of the National Forest’s flagship sites, near the villages of Moira and Donisthorpe. The most heavily mined area, left disfigured by coal production, has been transformed with well-established native broadleafs on the edges of bird-skimmed lagoons. A section of the Ashby Canal has been dredged and refilled; footpaths and cycle tracks weave around meadows, along reclaimed railways and through flourishing thickets flush, in season, with wildflowers and fungi. There are info boards dotted about too, which speak of the mining past, recognising the impact of the loss of industry.\nVicki James, the National Forest’s marketing manager, who grew up here when the project was in its infancy, rode with me for a while. She remembers planting trees as a schoolgirl – within the forest area, 90% of primary schools participate in outdoor education. “It made me so much more passionate about the environment,” she said. “I worked in London for a while but the forest called me back.”\nHicks Lodge is the National Forest’s cycling centre, so good trails were to be expected here. More of a surprise was the rest of the route Sue had designed, stringing together permissive paths, bridleways, farm tracks and back lanes. I rode through various woods, each with its own mood: mature, youthful, aspiring; pungent, playful, squirrelly. I also visited a fairly unexplored patch of the country at Staunton Harold, a picturesque hamlet with lovely lake, rolling parkland, a blush-pink manor and an old stable block now filled with artisans. Then I rode on to the Tollgate Brewery, on the National Trust’s Calke Abbey estate. Breathing new life into long-disused farm buildings, Tollgate also makes special ales – including Charnwood Copse bitter and Needwood Nobbler stout – that raise money for the National Forest. The taproom was heaving, the beer was good, but I eventually left, pedalling on through Calke, via inky tunnels and big old trees just crisping for the season, to pretty Ticknall village.\nAfter the community dinner at Whistlewood, and a night at the cosy Staff of Life inn, I set off the next day for Charnwood. There was plenty of interest on the way. In the market town of Melbourne, I nosed into the huge Norman church just as the bellringers began their practice. Then I rode up to Breedon’s church, lonely atop one of Leicestershire’s highest hills. And I pedalled an old railway line, past sculptures of vultures, before some fun forest off-roading around the ruined priory of Grace Dieu.\nI eventually reached St Joseph’s tearoom and, over one of its specialty scone-wiches, I met Dr Jack Matthews, geoheritage conservation and interpretation officer at Charnwood Forest. Charnwood isn’t just the ancient woodland marking the National Forest’s eastern edge. It’s an internationally significant landscape and aspiring Unesco global geopark, home to some of the oldest animal fossils known to have evolved. Dr Jack took me to several sites, including Morley Quarry, an impressive yet hidden-feeling amphitheatre of some of England’s oldest rocks, dating back 600m years. We finished at Bradgate Park, recently made a national nature reserve, and the jewel in Charnwood’s crown.\nHe showed me the grazing deer, the ancient oaks and the Swiss roll – a swirly formation that provides a perfect lesson in diagenesis (how sediment becomes rock, to you and me). He didn’t show me the fossils – “we can’t risk losing them, so don’t tell people where they are” – but he has grand plans for smart new interpretation, to help everyone understand their significance. “They reveal where we came from,” he said.\nThese were big ideas to contemplate, which I did, over wine, at Wigwam Holidays Charnwood Forest. Ten years ago, this plot near Bradgate was bare paddock. But, with a grant from the National Forest, Steve and Clare Small planted 700 trees, creating alcoves for sustainable-wood cabins. Now there’s an orchard, a pond, owls and badgers; they’re planning to add accessible cabins, plus a sensory garden for people with autism.\nThe wine was a local one: Rothley’s elderflowery King Richard, made in Leicestershire. Along with Sue’s holiday company, and Clare and Steve’s wigwams, Rothley is one of Charnwood’s geopartners, businesses committed to working together and supporting the geopark – just like the ethos of the wider National Forest. Because while the trees are great – and they are really, really great – none of this works without strong roots.\nThe trip was supported by nationalforest.org. National Forest E-bike Holidays offers bespoke ebiking and walking trips, with three-night breaks from £522pp (5% discount if arriving by public transport, £10 a booking donated to the National Forest). Cabins at Wigwam Holidays Charnwood Forest cost from £80 a night. The Staff of Life in Ticknall has B&B doubles from £110 a night"

    "raw_text": "In 2024, I was unexpectedly diagnosed with leukaemia. I was 34. I had no symptoms (none!) and it came at the worst possible time, although there is never a good time.\nI am a musician and was one week away from flying to New Zealand to be in a show. I was extremely excited about the show and, to be organised, I thought I’d get a blood test to check my iron levels before I left the country for five weeks.\nSix hours after the blood test, I got a call from my doctor telling me that something was wrong. I was what’s called neutropenic. In layman’s terms it meant I had no immune system and I needed to go to hospital immediately.\nIt made no sense. I had been in Savers, at my nieces’ school fete and the pub the day before. The doctor said to wear two masks and stand outside or I might not survive an infection – which sounded like a ridiculous overreaction for what I was sure was a mixed-up test. It wasn’t. After entering that hospital I wouldn’t leave it again for six weeks.\nAbout 7pm I was told I had cancer (who knew they have haematologists in emergency?). The diagnosis was utterly overwhelming. Although my family is amazing, they weren’t close by that night. A friend had come for a few hours to help translate what the doctors were saying while I was in a state of shock. But I was alone in my hospital bed when I woke up around 3am and it all suddenly hit me. All I could think about was that not only was I not going to New Zealand, but I also had cancer, and it was going to kill me. It always seems to kill people in the movies – writers, I beg you to stop doing that. Lots of us live.\nAs I was death-spiralling, a nurse walked past and asked if I was OK. I wasn’t. I just dissolved and, through tears, explained what was happening. He asked if I wanted a hug. I did, and I have never needed one more in my life. His name was Ben.\nThat night was probably the scariest part of my whole time with cancer – I’m now in remission. I never saw Ben again but his name stuck with me through the six weeks in hospital and eight months of chemo. His kind act meant the world to me then, and still means the world to me now.\nWhat is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?\nIf you’re having trouble using the form click here.

    "raw_text": "When I was about 19 or 20 I was driving through a genteel, leafy suburb on the north shore of Sydney when that most menacing of all Australian wildlife – a huntsman spider – raced across my windscreen. On the inside.\nMy arachnophobia is so intense that I would have vastly preferred it if a great white shark had crashed through the window. I’m surprised I didn’t lose the will to live immediately and simply died on the spot. Instead, I screamed, wrenched the wheel left and ran up the gutter, before hurling myself into a gasping panic on the kerb. I then proceeded to have what could only be described as a very loud, very visible breakdown.\nA few passersby asked if I was OK. I spluttered out the story and one by one they shrugged. “Oh you’ll be fine.” “Just get in, stop being so ridiculous,” jeered one.\nI would not be fine. I would not “just get in”. My only options were to walk home or accept this patch of grass as my new residence until I could arrange to have the car burned to the ground.\nJust as I was wondering, between sobs, exactly what sort of company I’d need to contact for “car burning services”, a woman pulled up in a pristine white Volvo. She had a perfectly coiffed blond bob and neat jeans and two young kids in the backseat who were no more than six years old. She got out of the car and asked me what was wrong, and I howled out the story, fully expecting her to recoil with a terror that matched mine and speed off in a cloud of Happy by Clinique.\nWhat happened next astonishes me to this day.\nWithout missing a beat, she patted me kindly on the shoulder and chirped “Let’s have a look shall we?” She rolled up her crisp white shirt sleeves, jumped into the front seat and began feeling around the entire car – under the dash, under the seats, everywhere.\nI stood alongside and gaped, barely able to comprehend her bravery. I couldn’t have been more impressed or relieved if she had produced two bazookas and full-scale body armour from her boot.\nAfter a few minutes of placing herself in the greatest of harm’s way (what if it runs on to her arm?), the spider declined to appear. So she bundled me briskly into her car with the kids (who were staring wide-eyed at the weird, hysterical lady) and drove me to her house where she dropped off the children, before reemerging with a can of insect spray. She then drove back to my car and drenched every millimetre of the interior so thickly it formed a white fog over every surface. “Maybe a bit more?” I squeaked.\nHer duty complete, she hugged me and sped off in a cloud of Happy by Clinique mixed with Mortein. And somehow, gathering every ounce of strength I had left in my body, I got back into my car and drove home.\nI never did find the spider and I was never comfortable driving that car again, but I knew on a practical level there was no way it could have survived that aerosol Armageddon. And to this day, I hold that valiant stranger up as one of Australia’s greatest living heroes.

    "raw_text": "Maya Angelou once said “a hero is any person really intent on making this a better place for all people” and when she said that, I can only assume she had Australian TikToker and micro-influencer Tennilles_deals in mind.\nWho exactly is Tennilles_deals? Firstly, she’s the Mother Teresa of Aussie supermarkets. Secondly, I don’t know anything about her personally because this savvy queen doesn’t market herself like your average influencer. She lets her work speak for itself.\nThe work in question? Weekly uploads of POV-style videos where Tennille meticulously goes through major supermarkets to show you what’s on special that week. Her soothing voice and steady hand shepherds you through a sea of yellow price tags. It’s detailed work, considerate and necessary.\nA deep shame I used to harbour is that I would wait by my phone every Monday at 5pm for the Coles and Woolworths catalogues to drop. Wednesday was even more special – that’s Aldi catalogue day, and nothing can rival the feeling of a niche European snack or a new power-cleaning tool with a 75% discount.\nFor me, looking through a supermarket catalogue produces a frisson I’ve only ever experienced while scouring the Royal Easter Show showbag booklet as a child of the early 2000s. The excitement I would feel running my finger over each lolly listed in the $15 (slightly offensively named) Mega Sumo Bag. The burden picking between Wonka or Wizz Fizz because I knew my mum wouldn’t let me get both. A supermarket catalogue offers the same thrill: an anticipation of what could soon be yours.\nBut the days of flipping through paper catalogues are well and truly over. That’s why Tennilles_deals is so important, giving us tight, three-minute videos that provide us with a 360-degree view of each product: a walking, talking catalogue. We’re in the combat zone of the Woolies and Coles duopoly with her and she is protecting us, guiding us through each aisle. She is our mum. We are her children.\nAnd I’m not alone in the admiration I have for this woman. There’s a reason Tennilles_deals has amassed almost 100,000 followers. She offers the people something the mega-chain supermarkets could never: a personable touch; a space where cash-strapped Aussies can vent about price-gouging.\nOne of her videos about the price of extra virgin olive oil starts a debate in the comments. Kerry from Tamworth says she remembers when it was only $7; we love-react Kerry’s comment in solidarity. She is not alone. We are not alone. Barry from Wagga Wagga voices outrage on the Cadbury chocolate block deal. We agree that two for $10 is ridiculous and we remember the simpler $3 block days. Barry then says something out of the blue about his hot cousin, but we ignore it because we agreed about the chocolate thing and we don’t need to go any further.\nThe effect of cozzie livs gives the average Australian fear when entering a supermarket. Gone are the days when I would enter a store without a list and a finite plan of what to purchase. Having the opportunity to see that I can get five Chobani pots for $10 soothes me. As do the gently encouraging words of Carol from Broken Hill: “Do not pass up that Chobani deal.” It means I can enter a Woolies free from the anxiety that I’ll go over budget in pursuit of protecting my gut microbiome.\nWhat Tennilles_deals is doing is building community. “Australian of the year,” one TikToker comments under her “Woolworths half price items spotted in store this week 29/7/25” post – and I couldn’t reply with three fire emojis more quickly if I tried.\nUnfortunately, nominations for 2026 Australian of the year are closed, so my only way to show my respect is via this very public essay. Keep doing the lord’s work, Tennille. The people love you and the people need you. You’re the real deal."

    "raw_text": "When I was a toddler, family and strangers alike would fawn over my crown of golden locks. I was often mistaken for a little girl.\nThen as I grew up, my parents – to save money – honed their craft as amateur hairdressers, with themselves, my two older brothers and I their sole clientele. They only took walk-ins, the small talk was awkward and intrusive, the reviews average at best. After each haircut there was always a nervous dash to the bathroom mirror to survey the damage. I often finished the job, trimming stray hairs around my ears with a pair of nail scissors.\nI didn’t visit a proper hairdresser until I was in my late teens. The first one I saw was my mother’s, an intimidatingly attractive and extroverted woman who described my hair to me and my mother as “pubey”.\nTo be truthful, I never had a chance. I was locked in a futile battle against my genes. While my father still has his hair, it’s thin on top. My eldest brother went bald at 22. I watched him for years as he tried different shampoos, supplements and medications. All in vain.\nWhile nature had it in for me, I certainly didn’t nurture myself either.\nAs a child, I had a compulsion to twist strands of hair into knotted little clumps, then rip them out when I was unable to detangle them. I’ve now learned that this is a disordered behaviour called trichotillomania.\nI once required an emergency buzzcut when I managed to get a wad of bubblegum caught in my hair, after trying to replicate the behind-the-ear storage technique of Violet Beauregarde from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\nWhen I was 11 I took part in the World’s Greatest Shave. My teacher performed the cranial landscaping on a Friday lunchtime in front of a curious crowd. Buoyed up by an inflated sense of self-righteousness, I steeled myself as he hacked through hair with my parents’ old clippers. The novelty wore off with each painful pass of the shears.\nWhen the show was over and the crowd dissipated, I was left blotchy-scalped and sore. I had forgotten to pack another school shirt and was miserably itchy for the rest of the day.\nAfter high school, I watched in horror as the front of my scalp became thinner and thinner. I would tug and wrench my fringe this way and that, trying to get it to sit down and behave.\nWind became my dreaded enemy. A stiff breeze would ruin any attempts at a coherent combover – and my day. I would constantly check how my hair looked on Snapchat’s front camera, closing the app in disgust at the wispy bird’s nest that stared back at me. With every visit to the barber, my hairline’s death march towards the back of my scalp became more obvious.\nAbout this time I started projecting my insecurities, becoming hyper-analytical of other men’s hairlines. I was obsessive. It was the first thing I noticed about someone. I began to recognise the hairstyles men would adopt to compensate for receding hair, their trepidation in removing their hats.\nSoon enough that trepidation became mine. Not even Tony Soprano could force me to take my hat off.\nAs if psychically attuned to my vulnerability, Instagram inundated me with ads for hair loss treatments: scalp brushes, ointments, laser, you name it. My Instagram explore page appeared to be bought and paid for by the Turkey tourism board – limousines and luxury accommodation luring the follicularly challenged to take the surgical route.\nMany people have asked me if that was something I would do, and I have been unwavering in my response – no, thank you. If God wanted me to look like a half-sucked lollipop that fell behind the couch, so be it. But to those who proceed down the Turkish hairlines path, I salute you. We should empower gender-affirming surgery in all its forms.\nSo, at the ripe old age of 24, I made the decision to go bald. Was I ready to let go, to embrace my new, more aerodynamic life? Or did I hate the way I looked and just want it over with? My final haircut, performed by my best friend with enthusiasm that made up for his lack of experience, was a euphoric moment. I was liberated, the old me swept off the floorboards in mangy piles. I felt like a reverse-Samson. Then I got cold and put a beanie on.\nNow I love being bald – I wear it as a badge of honour. I relish every dollar saved on haircuts. I cherish the unwarranted sense of seniority and maturity granted to me by strangers, though they quickly learn the error of their first impressions.\nWhile my propensity toward self-deprecating bald jokes – fruit so low hanging that it’s rotten – indicate I still have work to do, I am humbled to grace the pantheon of bald brothers and sisters: Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, Jason Statham, GI Jane and Broden Kelly from Aunty Donna, to name a few.\nWould I trade my excess stomach hair for a head of thick locks? Sure. Am I mostly grateful that I can grow a beard? Absolutely."

    "raw_text": "It’s a tradition almost as old as popular music itself: a band name that puns, plays on, or pays tribute to the name of another artist.\nIn the rock’n’roll era, you can trace it back at least to Chubby Checker. Known to his mum as Ernest Evans, the Chubber named himself in homage to Fats Domino and, in 1960, helped popularise a dance craze called “the twist”.\nThen came the Beatles, whose name was inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets. The Beatles begat the Byrds, and the Monkees, not to mention the Rutles – and on and on it goes.\nAnd on and on and on. In the past week, I have received notices for two Australian hopefuls, the Southern River Band and Shepparton Airplane. There is also Toowoomba’s Kathleen Turner Overdrive, whose name is cribbed from High Fidelity (it’s less likely they filched it from the obscure pop-punk band founded in Atlanta, Georgia in 1993).\nI have nothing whatsoever against the music of any of these groups. If my displeasure at their chosen nomenclature inspires you to seek them out, then good for you, and them. One of my own personal favourites, the Celibate Rifles, inverted their name from the Sex Pistols.\nBut, please. Weren’t the Dandy Warhols and their errant brothers in neo-psychedelia, the Brian Jonestown Massacre, enough already? Couldn’t we have given the great Camper Van Beethoven the last word?\nIt was around the time Nick Murphy started making inroads on the charts as Chet Faker in the 2010s that I really started thinking this shtick was getting beyond old hat. Maybe Murphy thought so too, because by 2016 he was releasing music under his own name. Unfortunately, when no one recognised him as his authentic self, he went back to Chet Faker.\nMuch worse was to come, though. There’s Joy Orbison, Joanna Gruesome (ew) and most recently, British punk duo Bob Vylan. It’s long past time tribute names were left to actual tribute bands: Dread Zeppelin, Jäh Division, Mac Sabbath and so on. To all you other New Originals: get your own.\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Medicine is a humanistic profession, grounded in ethical values of justice, beneficence and the commitment to do no harm. It is a vocation of healing, of saving lives and of easing physical and emotional suffering. Being a doctor requires inner strength – the ability to see another’s pain, to feel it and to respond with empathy and compassion, alongside the knowledge and professionalism the role demands. I believe a physician also bears a critical responsibility in advocating for their patients’ right to health and in upholding the principle of justice. In that sense, every doctor is, to me, a leader.\nI explored these ideas in a new Guardian documentary, The Oath. I tell my story as a Palestinian doctor living in Israel and working within its healthcare system. Made over the past year, the film portrays the struggles and challenges I have faced in that time. However, since I was first filmed in March 2024, the situation in Gaza, and the position we are in as doctors, has only worsened – day by day, hour by hour.\nAs a Palestinian doctor living and working in Israel, in the midst of a longstanding conflict, I learned during my studies and work that injustice has been done to many populations living here. The occupation and coercion that Israel exercises over the Palestinian population in the occupied territories and the policy of discrimination against the Palestinian minority living within Israel cause serious harm to the right to health of these populations. Control over territories, expulsion, dispossession, violence, restriction of movement, establishment of settlements and apartheid cause great suffering to the population, prevent access to medical care and directly affect their health. Already as a medical student, I decided that I could not sit on the sidelines in the face of all that. I joined Physicians for Human Rights – Israel in order to fight for the health of the populations under Israeli control, together with many partners.\nWhen we began filming the documentary, five months had already passed since Israel’s assault on Gaza began. At that point, thousands had been killed and widespread destruction had taken place. Still, I could not have dreamed that for the next year and a half we would continue to witness daily bombings, mass death – including thousands of children – millions displaced, starvation and the unprecedented decimation of Gaza’s health system. Hospitals, schools, mosques, churches, universities and entire neighbourhoods have been wiped off the map. The scale of devastation is unlike anything I have seen elsewhere. This is not merely a humanitarian crisis, it is what many international legal scholars and human rights organisations have begun to describe as a genocide in progress.\nMy personal story is inseparable from this struggle. Marwan, the brother of my sister-in-law, a paramedic, was killed in the line of duty on 7 October 2023. These past two weeks were even more tragic for his family: their tents in a camp in Gaza were bombed, killing 10 relatives, among them Abdullah, an eight-year-old boy full of life and dreams of becoming a doctor, murdered in his sleep. Little Marwan, seven years old, lay unconscious in a hospital for a week due to a severe head injury, but was denied proper treatment due to the severe shortage of medical staff and resources.\nSince that tragic day, more than 1,500 Palestinian medical personnel have been killed. Many have been detained, subjected to ongoing persecution and humiliation. Some have died by torture and neglect in Israeli detention facilities. All this takes place under deafening silence from the Israeli healthcare establishment and many of my fellow physicians, who too often choose silence over basic ethics and morality. Only very few voices were heard among some in the Israeli healthcare system against targeting their colleagues in Gazan hospitals.\nAmid all this, I try to speak with restraint, to choose my words carefully, out of fear and understanding that my voice might be seen as dangerous. Since 7 October, Palestinian staff in the Israeli healthcare system have faced persecution, slander and paralysis. Anti-Palestinian sentiment is surging, even among patients and colleagues. Slogans such as “there are no innocents in Gaza” or “burn Gaza to the ground” are neither rejected nor punished by the system. Any expression of sympathy for victims – women, children, innocent civilians – is seen as support for terror, and puts the speaker at risk of dismissal or disciplinary action.\nA fellow physician, a partner in our struggle, was recently fired for delivering a brief speech in which he criticised the crimes committed in Gaza. The silencing and persecution are only intensifying.\nMedicine, once assumed to be a neutral profession, has become politically and morally fraught. To treat an injured child in Gaza is no longer merely a medical duty – it is a profound moral declaration. The oath to provide equal care to all shatters against the brutal reality in which doctors and children are killed, patients are arrested, voices are suppressed and dreams – like Abdullah’s – collapse.\nAnd still, I continue to fight. Because as long as we remain silent, our oath is hollowed out, and the right to health becomes a fantasy too far to reach. Yet, as long as I have a voice, I will use it: for my patients, for justice, for the oath we all swore.\n-\nLina Qasem Hassan is a Palestinian doctor working in the Israeli healthcare system and is chairwoman of Physicians for Human Rights - Israel.

    "raw_text": "Doctors and medical staff in Gaza say their increasing hunger and the lack of available food is beginning to leave them too weak to provide urgent medical care to patients inside hospitals full of malnourished and injured civilians.\nAlmost a dozen medical staff across the territory have told the Guardian and the Arabic Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) of their increasingly desperate search for food and declining physical health due to hunger.\n“They are in a state of extreme exhaustion. Some have fainted in the operating rooms,” said Dr Mohammed Abu Selmia, the director of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, who said that like the people of Gaza, staff had not received any aid or had any meals in the past 48 hours.\n“Medical services will be affected because our staff will not be able to hold out any longer in the face of this famine,” he added.\nMany of the doctors and medical practitioners who sent messages to the Guardian did not want to be named as they feared being targeted by the Israeli military.\n“Today I have been on a 24-hour shift,” said one physician at al-Shifa hospital. “At [the hospital] they are supposed to give us some rice for each shift, but today they told us there was none. My colleague and I [treated] 60 neurosurgery patients and right now I can’t even stand.”\nAnother general practitioner volunteering at al-Shifa hospital said: “I haven’t had anything to eat since yesterday and my family has nothing to eat. All day, I am thinking how can I get them flour or lentils or anything to eat [but] here’s nothing in the markets. We are no longer able to walk. We don’t know what to do.”\nOne surgeon at Nasser medical complex in Gaza said that the workload facing overstretched medical staff was increasing as more patients were being admitted for symptoms related to malnourishment.\n“There are a high number of patients suffering from gastroenteritis, fainting and low blood sugar across all age groups of patients coming into the hospital,” he said. There is also a noticeable increase in post-surgical complications after operations due to malnutrition.\n“I couldn’t eat for two days because I feared worsening my own gastroenteritis, and because of my low blood pressure I had to stop during a surgery on a girl who had been shot in the abdomen,” he said.\nAbu Selmia said medical staff were still working despite the lack of food, but that the scale of the malnutrition they were facing in patients was putting a huge strain on an already depleted and exhausted workforce. He said that 21 children had died across the Palestinian territory in the past three days “due to malnutrition and starvation”.\n“[These patients] need special nutrition, but there isn’t any, so they face risks,” he said. “Some die in their tents and homes and no one knows about it.”\nYesterday, the Unrwa chief, Philippe Lazzarini, said that his team had received reports of healthcare and aid workers across Gaza fainting due to hunger and exhaustion because of a lack of food.\nSome medical staff spoke of having to decide whether to remain at work and provide urgent medical care or go out on to the streets to search for food for their families.\nOthers spoke of their fear of being forced to go to food distribution sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and guarded by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which are the only place where food and aid is being allowed to be passed on to civilians in Gaza. Since May, more than 1,000 people have died while seeking food from the centres and other humanitarian convoys, according to the UN\nGaza’s healthcare system has been decimated during the 23 months of the conflict. In May, the World Health Organization said that at least 94% of all hospitals in the Gaza Strip were damaged or destroyed and only 19 of the Gaza Strip’s 36 hospitals remained operational.\n“In recent days, healthcare workers in Gaza have collectively reported unprecedented levels of food insecurity, lowered immunity, repeated infections, severe fatigue, and frequent fainting during surgeries and rescue missions,” said Muath Alser, director of Healthcare Worker Watch, a Palestinian medical organisation. “We cannot afford mere condemnation. We need urgent action.”\nIn a statement, the IDF said that it is working to facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid in order to allow hospitals in Gaza to continue to operate.\nIt also said that “following incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted in the Southern Command and instructions were issued to forces in the field following lessons learned. The aforementioned incidents are under review by the competent authorities in the IDF.”"

    "raw_text": "Two leading human rights organisations based in Israel, B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights, say Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and the country’s western allies have a legal and moral duty to stop it.\nIn reports published on Monday, the two groups said Israel had targeted civilians in Gaza only because of their identity as Palestinians over nearly two years of war, causing severe and in some cases irreparable damage to Palestinian society.\nA number of international and Palestinian groups have already described the war as genocidal, but reports from two of Israel-Palestine’s most respected human rights organisations, who have for decades documented systemic abuses, is likely to add to pressure for action.\nThe reports detailed crimes including the killing of tens of thousands of women, children and elderly people, mass forced displacement and starvation, and the destruction of homes and civilian infrastructure that have deprived Palestinians of healthcare, education and other basic rights.\n“What we see is a clear, intentional attack on civilians in order to destroy a group,” said Yuli Novak, the director of B’Tselem, calling for urgent action. “I think every human being has to ask himself: what do you do in the face of genocide?”\nIt is vital to recognise that a genocide is under way even without a ruling in the case before the international court of justice, she said. “Genocide is not just a legal crime. It’s a social and political phenomenon.”\nPhysicians for Human Rights (PHR) focuses in its report on a detailed chronological account of the assault on Gaza’s health system, with many details documented directly by the group’s own team, which worked regularly in Gaza before 7 October 2023.\nThe destruction of the healthcare system alone makes the war genocidal under article 2c of the genocide convention, which prohibits deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy a group “in whole or part”, said its director, Guy Shalev.\n“You don’t have to have all five articles of the genocide convention to be fulfilled in order for something to be genocide,” he said, although the report also details other genocidal aspects of Israel’s war.\nBoth B’Tselem and PHR said Israel’s western allies were enabling the genocidal campaign, and shared responsibility for suffering in Gaza. “It couldn’t happen without the support of the western world,” Novak said. “Any leader that is not doing whatever they can to stop it is part of this horror.”\nThe US and European countries have a legal responsibility to take stronger action than they have done so far, Shalev said. “Every tool in the toolbox should be used. This is not what we think, this is what the genocide convention calls for.”\nIsrael denies is it carrying out a genocide, and says the war in Gaza is one of self-defence after cross-border attacks by Hamas on 7 October 2023 killed 1,200 people, the majority civilians. More than 250 others were kidnapped and taken to Gaza, where 50 remain held hostage, with 20 of them believed to still be alive.\nOn Monday a spokesperson for the Israeli government called the allegation made by the rights groups “baseless”. “There is no intent, [which is] key for the charge of genocide ... It simply doesn’t make sense for a country to send in 1.9m tons of aid, most of that being food, if there is an intent of genocide,” said spokesperson David Mencer.\nA key element to the crime of genocide, as defined by the international convention, is showing intent by a state to destroy a target group in whole or part.\nGenocidal statements from politicians and military leaders, and a chronology of well-documented impacts on civilians after nearly two years of war are proof of that intent, even without a paper trail of orders from the top, both PHR and B’Tselem say.\nThe PHR report details how “genocidal intent may be inferred from the pattern of conduct”, citing legal precedent from the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda.\nThe extensive documentation, by medics, media and human rights organisations over a long period of time, meant Israel’s government could not claim it did not understand the impact of its actions, Shalev said. “There were enough times and enough opportunities for Israel to stop this gradual systematic attack.”\nIncitement to genocide has been recorded since the start of the war. It is one of two issues on which the Israeli judge hearing the case at the international court of justice voted with the majority when ordering emergency measures for the protection of Palestinians from the plausible risk of genocide.\n“We don’t need to guess what Israel is doing and what the Israeli army is doing, because from the first day of this attack, Israeli leaders, the highest leadership, political leadership, including the prime minister, the minister of defence, the president of Israel said exactly that,” Novak said.\n“They talked about human animals. They talked about the fact that there are no civilians in Gaza or that there is an entire nation responsible for 7 October.”\n“If the leadership of Israel, whether the army leadership and the political leadership, knows about the consequences of this policy and keep going, it is very clear that is intentional.”\nThe destruction of health infrastructure, two years without medical care and the killing of medical workers also meant the toll from the genocide would continue to mount even after any ceasefire halts fighting, Shalev said.\n“For example, there have been no MRI machines in Gaza for months now, so what about all the illnesses and diseases that were not diagnosed all that time. There are all the malnutrition and chronic diseases that went untreated, we’re going to see the effects of that for months and years to come.”\nWhile medication can be brought in within days, there is no easy way to replace medical workers who have been killed, including specialists who took decades to train, he said.\n“Looking at the conditions of life opens this kind of temporal scale that is frightening if we want to believe in a future where … the people of Gaza somehow get to live their lives safely and in good health. It’s very hard to see that.”\nThe death toll in Gaza from the war is approaching 60,000, or more than 2.5% of the prewar population. Some of those who defend Israel’s war argue that is too low for the campaign to be considered genocide.\nThat is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the crime of genocide, which the convention defines as targeting a group “in whole or in part”, Novak said. “It doesn’t mean that you need to kill each and every person.”\nA genocide targeting Palestinians as a group was possible only because Israel for decades dehumanised Palestinians and denied their rights, Novak said. Collective trauma was exploited by far-right politicians to accelerate an agenda they had been pursuing for years.\n“[7 October ] was a shocking moment and a turning point for Israelis because it instilled a real sincere feeling of existential threat. That was the moment that pushed a whole system and how it operates in Gaza from a policy of control and oppression into one of destruction and extermination.”\nNow Israel had launched a genocidal campaign in Gaza, there was an urgent risk that it could spread to target other Palestinians, the B’Tselem report warned.\n“The Israeli regime now has a new tool that they didn’t use before – genocide. And the fact that that this tool or this policy used in Gaza is not yet [deployed] in other areas is not something that we can count on for long,” Novak said.\nThe West Bank is a particular concern, with almost 1,000 Palestinians killed and more than 40,000 displaced from communities including Jenin and Tulkarem, in a campaign of escalating attacks and ethnic cleansing since 7 October 2023.\n“What we see is basically the same regime with the same logic, the same army, usually the same commanders and even the same soldiers who just fought in Gaza. They are now in the West Bank where violence is on the rise,” Novak said.\n“What we worry about and want to warn about is the fact that any small trigger might make the genocide spill over from Gaza into the West Bank.”"

    "raw_text": "Democrat Chuck Schumer returned to the Senate floor last week with some urgent questions. “Will Senate Republicans continue to kowtow to a leader they know is dragging the country down?” he demanded. “That they know is a pathological liar? Or will they, as the Founding Fathers intended, stand up to him? Will they help us fight America’s slide into authoritarianism?”\nIt was a recognition of how Donald Trump has spent eight months seeking to expand presidential power at the expense of Congress and others. He has signed 200 executive orders – more than Joe Biden in four years – unleashed squadrons of national guard troops in Washington, turned investigators on his political foes and sought to bring academic, cultural, financial and legal institutions to heel.\nThe capitulation has moved faster and further than even many of Trump’s critics expected and has left them looking for democratic guardrails that might yet constrain him. But as members of Congress returned to Washington this week, there were only flickers of hope that they might heed Schumer and reassert their usurped authority.\nTrump’s Republican party holds narrow majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate, and remains overwhelmingly loyal to him. In May, during a debate on their signature tax and spending bill, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, called Trump “arguably the most powerful, the most successful, and the most respected president in the modern era of the United States”. Congress has in effect become his rubber stamp.\nLarry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “One thing we could be confident of for the next year and a half is that Congress with Republican majorities is not going to check Donald Trump.\n“The fear of Donald Trump in the midterm elections, the massive amount of campaign funds that he and his supporters have raised and that is being used to threaten members – in some cases physical threats – has tamed the Republicans in Congress. I have no hope that they’re going to check Donald Trump.”\nYet in recent days small fractures appeared in the edifice. Congressman Thomas Massie gained the support of fellow Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace on a discharge petition to force a vote on releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files. Hours after Trump described the issue as a “Democratic hoax”, Greene shot back: “It’s not a hoax because Jeffrey Epstein is a convicted pedophile.”\nSome Republicans’ patience is also wearing thin with Trump’s health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, over his moves to undermine vaccines and purge leadership at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Senator John Barrasso, a doctor, told Kennedy that he was “deeply concerned” about his leadership on vaccines.\nIn addition, numerous Republicans have faced blowback from voters during town halls in their district over the summer. Opinion polls show that Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act – rebranded as The Working Families Tax Cuts Act – is the most unpopular major piece of legislation in a generation. And Friday’s dismal jobs reports reflected uncertainty around his economic agenda.\nIf the trend continues, swing-state Republicans might be tempted to distance themselves from him in next year’s midterm elections and then treat him as a lame duck as the race for 2028 heats up.\nThom Hartmann, a political analyst and author of the upcoming book The Last American President: A Broken Man, a Corrupt Party, and a World on the Brink, suggests Trump’s sway over Congress might be more fragile than it appears.\n“The simple reality is that five or six Republicans in the House and two or three or four Republicans in the Senate could stop Trump in his tracks,” he said. “They can put an end to this insanity.\n“Increasingly, as public opinion is turning against him – he’s polling very negatively in virtually every aspect of his presidency, from the economy to the troops in the streets to destroying federal agencies – at some point some of these Republicans are going to look around and say, you know, maybe the way to ensure my own political survival is to challenge this guy. That day can’t come soon enough for me.”\nFor Democrats, the challenge is different. They are trapped in the minority with few levers to pull. Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, are likely to face pressure from their base to demonstrate fighting spirit. Both New Yorkers are facing criticism for refusing to endorse Zohran Mamdani, a progressive who won the Democratic primary for mayor of New York.\nSchumer was also widely condemned for deciding in March to rally enough Democratic votes to pass a Republican-led spending bill to prevent a government shutdown. As Congress barrels towards a repeat at the end of the month, he appears unlikely to cave a second time.\nReed Galen, president of the Union, a pro-democracy coalition, said: “If you make an argument that we’ve already descended into an authoritarian hellscape, or we’re on the edge of it, then how much worse could be shutting down the government? The Republicans own it.\n“Schumer has a lot of people watching him; if he gives in without some significant concession before the 30th then it’s going to be a very ugly fall and winter for him and for the party generally. You could see a lot of Democrats taking him to task because they’re like, if you’re not going to be the opposition party, why are you there?”\nThe energy in the party is, by contrast, with state governors such as Gavin Newsom of California and JB Pritzker of Illinois, who have been vociferous in pushing back against the Trump administration and offering the fight that activists crave. Both have the added incentive of potential runs for president in 2028.\nHartmann said: “Democrats are desperate for somebody who can reclaim the mantle of Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Those were two presidents, two Democratic politicians, who did not take crap from anybody. They were famous for getting stuff done over the loud objections of even people in their own party and both of them were called dictators by Republicans loudly, frequently.”\nCongress has been struggling to hold its own as Trump steamrolls past the legislative branch in ways unseen in peacetime presidencies. For example, he issued an executive order that effectively ignored a bipartisan law, affirmed by a unanimous supreme court decision, to ban TikTok.\nHe also bypassed Congress to shut down USAID and other agencies and deploy military forces in Los Angeles against peaceful protesters. Perhaps most threatening in the erosion of the separation of powers, Trump used a rare administrative tool to claw back federal funds that Congress had already approved.\nBill Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, suggested that the courts, not Congress, offer the best hope of providing a bulwark against authoritarianism.\n“The president has made extraordinary assertions of executive power that raise constitutional questions as well as policy questions,” he said. “On those questions, in our system, only the supreme court can provide definitive answers and they’ll have no choice but to do that.\n“For better, for worse, that is the thickest reed that Democrats can cling to because certainly between now and November 2026 their minority status isn’t going to change and the willingness of the majority to accommodate the minority is not likely to increase.”"

    "raw_text": "They are more than a year away – a lifetime in today’s fast and furious political cycle. But one man is already paying attention, pulling the levers of power and trying to tip the scales of the 2026 midterm elections.\nDonald Trump has made clear that he is willing to bring the full weight of the White House to bear to prevent his Republican party losing control of the US Congress in the midterm elections next year, orchestrating a more direct and legally dubious intervention than any of his predecessors.\nThe US president’s multipronged approach includes redrawing congressional district maps, seeking to purge voter rolls, taking aim at mail-in voting and voting machines, and ordering the justice department to investigate Democrats’ prime fundraising tool.\n“Nobody’s ever tried to do this,” said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington. “Most American presidents, Democratic or Republican, have basically played by the same rules and been careful of the constitution. But in his business career Trump never cared about whether he was doing something legal or not; he just went to court and same thing here.”\nCampaigning, not governing, has often been Trump’s comfort zone. He is constitutionally barred from running for president again but already has an eye on the November 2026 elections that will determine control of the House of Representatives and Senate.\nHe senses that law and order, a populist cause long exploited by Republicans, could play to his advantage. Earlier this month Trump deployed the national guard to reduce crime in Washington DC and threatened similar federal interventions in other big cities. Fifty-three per cent of the public approve of how he is handling crime, according to an AP-NORC poll, higher than other issues.\nTrump told a cabinet meeting this week: “I think crime will be the big subject of the midterms and will be the big subject of the next election. I think it’s going to be a big, big subject for the midterms and I think the Republicans are going to do really well.”\nBut this is no ordinary campaign. Trump said at the same marathon meeting: “I have the right to do anything I want to do. I’m the president of the United States.”\nTaking a familiar political manoeuvre to new extremes, he has pushed Republican state legislators in Texas to redraw their congressional map because he claims “we are entitled to five more seats”, and he is lobbying other red states, including Indiana and Missouri, to take similar steps to pad the margin even more.\nOther steps involve the direct use of official presidential power in ways that have no modern precedent. He ordered his justice department to investigate ActBlue, an online portal that raised hundreds of millions of dollars in small-dollar donations for Democratic candidates over two decades.\nThe site has been so successful that Republicans launched a similar venture, called WinRed. But Trump did not order a federal investigation into WinRed.\nTrump’s appointees at the justice department have also demanded voting data from at least 19 states in an apparent attempt to look for ineligible voters. Earlier this year he signed an executive order seeking documented proof of citizenship to register to vote, among other changes, though much of it has been blocked by courts.\nLast week the president announced that lawyers were drafting an executive order to end mail-in balloting, a method used by nearly one in three Americans, and threatened to do away with voting machines. He claimed that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told him mail-in voting was responsible for his 2020 election loss.\nThere is nothing remarkable about a sitting president campaigning for his party in the midterms and trying to bolster incumbents by steering projects and support to their districts. But Trump’s actions constitute a unique attempt to interfere in a critical election before it is even held, raising alarms about the future of democracy.\nAllan Lichtman, a distinguished history professor at American University in Washington, said: “We’re seeing a new concerted assault on free and fair elections, harkening back to the discredited efforts of the white supremacists in the Jim Crow south. He’s trying to rig the midterms and then of course beyond that the next presidential election in his political favour.”\nTrump previously attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, which culminated in an insurrection by his supporters at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. On that occasion, he was constrained by elected Republicans such as his then vice-president, Mike Pence, and the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. This time he has locked down near-total loyalty from the party and assembled a cabinet that again this week offered an ostentatious display of fealty.\nHis power grab will not go entirely unchallenged. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, signed legislation that will allow voters to decide in November on a redrawn congressional map designed to help Democrats win five more House seats next year, neutralising Republicans’ gerrymandering in Texas.\nBut Democrats, activists and lawyers will have to find others ways to “fight fire with fire” when it comes to Trump’s more extreme meddling.\nLichtman, author of a new book, Conservative at the Core, added: “Republicans have no principles; Democrats have no spine. Democrats need to grow a spine. They need to stop playing not to lose – that’s a sure way to lose. They need to respond to these outrages powerfully and aggressively by whatever means are possible or we’re going to lose our democracy.”\nYet while Trump’s gambit is a flex of executive power, it could also be seen as an admission of potential weakness. The incumbent president’s party typically loses seats in midterm elections. In 2018, Democrats won enough to take back the House, stymieing Trump’s agenda and leading to his impeachment.\nOnly 37% of voters approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released on Wednesday, while 55% disapprove. House Republicans, who currently have just a three-seat margin, have faced a series of raucous town halls that bode ill for their fortunes.\nWendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “President Trump and the Republicans would not be trying to stack the deck if they didn’t think they were going to lose the hand. They are looking at poll numbers and they know midterms are bad to incumbent presidents over the last 60 years and it’s a very slim margin in the House.\n“In order for Trump to sustain the loyalty of the House – he’s already gotten everything he pretty much wants – he needs them to think he’s on their side so he’s going to go out and be very public about rigging the voting system to keep them in power.”\nBut Schiller added: “Will that be enough to overcome general unhappiness at the moment that the voters seem to have with the economy, inflation, even Trump’s border policies? It’s not enough to keep the Republicans in line. You have to get independent voters to vote for you again and that’s at risk for the Republicans right now.”"

    "raw_text": "In a recent podcast conversation, the former spokesperson for Jeb Bush sat down with the leader of the House Democrats. Guess which one of them endorsed the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York?\n“I was a Republican up until two minutes ago and I’m a capitalist, and I had Zohran on … it’s not really a close call, is it?” Tim Miller said to Hakeem Jeffries on his Bulwark podcast, to which a defensive-sounding House Minority leader replied: “What I can say is that he’s the only one I’m scheduled to talk to.”\nTime and time again, Jeffries has refused to endorse his own party’s official candidate for mayor in his own city, two months after Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic mayoral primary in New York by double digits – including Jeffries’ own congressional district by eight points.\nThis is the same Democratic party leader who has insisted in the past that progressives should “vote BLUE (no matter who)”. But centrists? Apparently, they’re under no such obligation.\nJeffries is not alone in his brazen hypocrisy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader who represents the state of New York and lives in the city of New York, has also refused to endorse his own party’s official candidate for mayor of New York.\nIf you want to understand why the Democrats are polling at their lowest point for more than three decades, look no further than these two uninspiring Democratic leaders in Congress.\nIf you want to understand why 62% of Democratic voters say “the leadership of the Democratic party should be replaced with new people,” again, look no further than Jeffries and Schumer.\nWeek after week, month after month, they embarrass themselves, undermine their colleagues and demoralize their voters. Theirs is a record of cowardice and capitulation.\nLet’s start with Jeffries. In February, the hapless House minority leader wondered aloud: “I’m trying to figure out what leverage we actually have. They control the House, the Senate. And the presidency. It’s their government. What leverage do we have?” It was a shrug of impotence; a sign of pre-emptive submission only weeks after Trump’s inauguration.\nThat same month, just days before Bernie Sanders began his “Fighting Oligarchy” tour in front of packed arenas across the country, Jeffries “quietly met with more than 150 Silicon Valley-based donors … in tony Los Altos Hills”, reported Politico, in order to “mend fences” with the billionaire big tech bosses.\nIn April, when Democratic members of Congress such as Senator Chris Van Hollen and Representative Maxwell Frost were visiting El Salvador and raising the issue of Kilmar Ábrego García’s detention, the Bulwark reported: “The minority leader has discouraged further excursions to the country” (reporting that Jeffries later denied). Subsequent polling suggests those trips helped change public opinion on immigration and, especially, on the fate of Ábrego. Jeffries, though, can claim no credit for that shift in American sentiment.\nIn June, in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to file ludicrous charges of assault against the Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver after a protest outside an immigration detention center, the dead-eyed Jeffries appeared on CNN with host Dana Bash.\nBASH: You previously warned that the administration charging members of Congress was a, quote, ‘red line’. What are you doing now that the red line you talked about has apparently been crossed?\nJEFFRIES: We will make that decision in a time, place and manner of our choosing. But the response will be continuous, and it will meet the moment that is required.\nBASH: What exactly does that mean? Have you not decided how to respond?\nJEFFRIES: We will respond in a time, place, and manner of our choosing if this continues to happen.\nBash looked bewildered. And we’re now coming up to three months since Jeffries made those bizarre, tone-deaf remarks. Has the time not arrived yet? Has he still not found the place?\nLast month, Jeffries refused, again, to endorse Mamdani but then went further, telling CNBC that Andrew Cuomo’s baseless attack on Mamdani’s rent-stabilized apartment was a “legitimate issue” and that his campaign was “going to have to address it”. Can you imagine a Republican leader in Congress going on live television to throw their party’s mayoral candidate under the bus in this way?\nJeffries has become almost a parody of a weak, spineless Democratic leader. When he was asked recently about Trump’s fascistic deployment of troops to the streets of Washington DC, his response was to praise the DC attorney general’s “strongly worded letter”.\nWell, you know who else likes to bring a “strongly worded letter” to a gunfight with Republicans? Yep. You guessed it. Chuck Schumer. The Senate minority leader bragged to CNN earlier this year about how he had reacted to Donald Trump’s attack on US universities by sending him “a very strong letter just the other day”.\nTo be clear: Schumer’s record on resisting Trump and fighting back against his authoritarian takeover of the US government has been as feeble and feckless as Jeffries’.\nRemember that cringe chant of ‘We will win’ and ‘We won’t rest’ that he led outside the Treasury building in February, as Elon Musk’s Doge teams rampaged through the federal government?\nOr when he shamefully backed down from a confrontation with Trump over a government shutdown in March and earned the scathing soubriquet “Surrender Schumer”? (One anonymous House Democrat joked at the time that the Senate minority leader’s popularity was “hovering somewhere between Elon Musk and the Ebola virus”.)\nHow about when he told NPR that same month that accusing Israel of genocide – now the view of 77% of Democratic voters – was antisemitic, or when he declared to the neoconservative Bret Stephens that his job was “to keep the left pro-Israel”?\nWho can forget also his hawkish denunciation of “Taco Trump” in June for not being “tough” enough on the “terrorist government” of Iran, just weeks before Trump illegally bombed Iran?\nIt makes no sense to me that Schumer is still the leader of the Democrats in the Senate. The party lost the upper chamber on his watch, under his leadership, but Schumer chose to stay on and his colleagues let him. But when you lead your party to defeat in an election, shouldn’t you … lose your job?\nAs for Jeffries, the Democrats may win back the House of Representatives next November on the back of an anti-Trump wave, but what then? What vision will a Speaker Jeffries offer? What resistance will he provide to the wannabe dictator in the White House? What actual plan does he have to preserve and protect democracy in 2028?\nSince Trump was inaugurated for a second time in January, Jeffries and Schumer have demonstrated time and again that they are not built for this particular moment. While Trump seeds the ground for an American dictatorship, these two top Dems pine for bipartisanship. While millions of rank-and-file Democrats across the country say they want leaders who will fight, Jeffries and Schumer fold. While younger Democrats like Mamdani and AOC offer energy and charisma, these two lackluster leaders in the House and Senate offer cringe chants and even cringier photo ops.\nIt is past time for both Jeffries and Schumer to step down and step aside. This fascist moment, this age of Trump, demands outspoken, unrelenting and fearless opposition. Whether you are a Democrat, or simply a democrat, we all deserve better.\n-\nMehdi Hasan is the founder, CEO and editor-in-chief of the media company Zeteo and a Guardian US columnist\nComments (…)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

    "raw_text": "Senate Democrats on Monday compromised on a short-term spending measure to reopen the federal government after forcing a shutdown over an impasse on immigration.\nBut some progressives and immigration activists preferred another word: caved.\nThree days after Democrats rejected a stopgap bill because it did not include protections for Dreamers, young undocumented immigrants shielded by an Obama-era program known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, they yielded, ending the first government shutdown in a half-decade.\nIn a 81-18 vote on Monday, Democrats approved a three-week spending measure in exchange for a commitment from Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who pledged to allow a vote on legislation that would extend protections to Dreamers, whose status was thrown into chaos when Trump cancelled Daca in September.\nThe House passed the bill later on Monday, in a vote largely along party lines.\nDick Durbin, the No 2 Democrat in the Senate and one of the leading congressional advocates for Dreamers, saw the silver linings of the deal.\n“Parts of this were a victory in terms of moving to immigration for the first time in five years, with a deadline, with an understood procedure with the other side acknowledging this is about Daca,” Durbin said. “They started using that word. Leader McConnell started using it today. It isn’t where I wanted to be today but I think we are closer to our goal than we’ve ever been.”\nTim Kaine, the 2016 Democratic nominee for vice-president, echoed this. “The commitment we made today is we’re going forward [on immigration] whether or not the president wants us to.”\nYet other Democrats were skeptical of leaving the fate of Dreamers in the hands of the Senate majority leader, whom they do not trust, and the president, who has proved to be an unpredictable negotiator.\n“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever,” Kamala Harris, a senator from California who opposed the bill, said after the Senate advanced the measure. “And I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment.”\nHarris was among several progressive lawmakers and potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who rejected the bill, including senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\nDemocrats went into the weekend confident that voters were on their side. Public polling indicated that Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and the White House, would be held responsible.\nBut Trump and Republicans spent the days since the shut down attacking Democrats for allegedly prioritizing undocumented immigrants over members of the military.\n“I think if we’ve learned anything during this process, it’s that a strategy to shut down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something the American people didn’t understand and would not have understood in the future,” McConnell said in remarks on the floor on Monday.\nIn contrast to the 2013 government shutdown, when conservative Republicans threatened to close the government over Obamacare, Democrats did achieve some successes. They had long pushed for reauthorization of the children’s health insurance program (Chip) and the concession by McConnell for a floor vote on immigration could spur action on immigration while shifting the onus back on to Republicans.\nThis, however, did not not satisfy many in the party’s activist base, who accused lawmakers of betrayal.\n“Last week, I was moved to tears of joy when Democrats stood up and fought for progressive values and for Dreamers,” said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a national immigration advocacy group. “Today, I am moved to tears of disappointment and anger that Democrats blinked.”\nThe drawdown was particularly glaring in the aftermath of the Women’s March, which saws tens of thousands of activists in cities across the country protest against Trump and congressional Republicans. Many of the women carried signs in support of the Dream Act, legislative fix for the young immigrants.\n“Millions of people flooded the streets of every major American city to stand up to Trump this weekend,” said Leah Greenberg, the co-executive director of Indivisible, an influential activists network. “Your constituents want you to fight. How can you possibly not understand that?”\nCharles Chamberlain, the executive director of the progressive organization, Democracy for America, said Democrats “stunning display of moral and political cowardice” jeopardizes the party’s chances of reclaiming the House majority in 2018.\nProgressives and immigrant advocates are doubtful the House will take up the measure to offer legal status to undocumented immigrants. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, has not agreed to bring an immigration bill up for a vote. Further, Republicans are not sure what Trump wants on immigration.\n“If Trump can be compelled to do something other than cower in fear, he could flip the House in an instant,” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director at MoveOn.org. “Short of that it takes a tsunami of grassroots pressure to make Republicans who say they support Dreamers actually use the power they hold.”\nEarlier this month, Trump called for a bipartisan “bill of love” that would protect Dreamers and also provide funding for a wall along the southern border. During the same meeting, he embraced comprehensive immigration reform and promised to shield Republicans from the political blowback if they struck a deal. But in the intervening weeks, he has walked back from accepting a deal.\nSome Republicans have insisted they should only consider legislation with the White House’s seal of approval. “We should not spend our time on passing a bill that the president wouldn’t sign,” said Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who is the chair of the Senate judiciary committee.\nNot all progressive organizations heaped blame on Democrats.\n“It’s remarkable that Republicans cannot keep a Republican-run government open,” said Jesse Lehrich of Organizing for America.\n“Now, we all must ensure Mitch McConnell keeps his word.”"

    "raw_text": "In the opening weeks of Donald Trump’s second term, Gavin Newsom wagered that peacemaking was best: a tarmac greeting for Air Force One, an Oval Office visit and a podcast slot for Maga’s biggest names. But then Trump came for California, and its governor dropped the niceties.\nWith a flood of all-caps social media posts, a counterpunching redistricting proposal and a string of lawsuits challenging the new administration, Newsom is not just taking on Trump, he’s stealing his tactics: fight, fight, fight.\n“We’ve got to wake up, disabuse ourselves as Democrats,” Newsom said on a podcast last week. “I’m sick of being weak. I’m sick of being effete. I’m sick of being non-consequential. It’s not good enough to say it – it’s time to do.”\nNewsom has charged on to the national stage as a recast political brawler willing to wield power as ruthlessly as the other side. On Thursday, he signed redistricting legislation establishing a special election to ask voters to temporarily redraw the state’s congressional boundaries and give Democrats as many as five additional US House seats in next year’s midterm elections.\nThe ballot measure is a direct attempt to “neuter and neutralize” Texas’s partisan gerrymander, engineered at Trump’s behest, to safeguard Republicans’ fragile House majority. At a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, Newsom cited the president’s claim that he was “entitled” to five additional congressional seats in the Lone Star state: “That should put chills up your spine.”\nNow the California referendum transforms an off-cycle election year into a high-stakes national showdown that could determine control of Congress – and set the stage for 2028. For Newsom, who is term-limited and widely viewed as a presidential contender, the success – or failure – of this 11-week sprint could carry major consequences for his political future.\nThe November special election gives voters in deep-blue California a chance to strike back at Trump, who has relentlessly tormented the state since returning to the White House. But by temporarily overriding California’s independent redistricting commission – long a point of pride in the Golden state – Democrats are being asked to “compromise their own values”, said Kim Nalder, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.\n“That’s been a guiding light for a lot of Democrats – the whole ‘they go low, we go high’ idea,” she said. “One of the risks is that the Democratic party – and Newsom himself – become associated with this all-out brawl, no-holds-barred fighting, rather than having a particular set of political principles that they stand by no matter what.”\nHow Californians will decide remains uncertain. A Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll released on Friday shows 48% of registered voters in the state support Newsom’s redistricting plan, compared with 32% who oppose it. Another 20% are undecided, providing an opening for either campaign to make their pitch.\n“If Proposition 50 passes, and Californians succeed in adding more House seats, and is partially, if not completely, responsible for flipping the House next year, he’s a hero, plain and simple,” said Bill Whalen, a Hoover Institution fellow who was a speechwriter for Pete Wilson, the former Republican governor of California.\nEven if the initiative falls short in November, Whalen believes Newsom still benefits. “He still gets credit among those same Democrats for fighting the good fight,” he said. “I don’t see how he fails.”\nThe all-out political war between the president and California’s governor erupted earlier this summer, when Trump seized control of California’s national guard and deployed US marines to Los Angeles, over Newsom’s objections, to suppress protests against the federal immigration crackdown. The raids are ongoing, and Trump has targeted the state in other ways: an attempt to strip federal funding from UCLA, and tariffs that threaten California’s economy – the fourth largest in the world.\nNewsom has argued that Trump is not just a threat to his state – but to the entire 249-year-old American project. While his approach might offend virtue-minded Democrats, he says the moment demands it.\n“Yes, I’ve changed,” he said recently in a local news interview. “The facts have changed. We need to change.”\nIn recent weeks, as Newsom has stepped up his attacks on Trump as a “weak” and a “failed” leader, his social media team has trolled the president online – unleashing a jumble of unfiltered, stream-of-consciousness rants, AI-generated political fan art and schoolyard taunts, some of it signed with the governor’s initials, GCN, meant to parody the president’s own chaotic posting style.\nNewsom says he’s simply holding up a mirror. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out,” he told reporters last week, “you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president.”\nThe posts have gone viral – racking up millions of views, thousands of comments and driving a flood of engagement. They have also caught the attention of the right. Fox News hosts, Kid Rock, JD Vance and even Trump himself have all taken the bait, provoking what the governor’s staff gleefully dubbed “Maga meltdowns”.\n“JESSE WATTERS KEPT CALLING ME ‘DADDY’ (VERY WEIRD, NOT INTERESTED, BUT THANK YOU!)” his office clapped back, in an 188-word tweet about Fox News’s breathless coverage of Newsom’s furious posting streak.\n“Gavin Newsom can mimic Donald Trump all that he wants to,” Vance told the Fox News host Laura Ingraham, “they’re still going to lose unless they get better policies that actually serve the American people.”\nTrump, for his part, weighed in on his own social media platform, Truth Social, vowing to save “the Once Great State of California” from “Newscum”.\n“Triggered?” Newsom replied with a wink.\nThe Berkeley poll suggested that California voters back his gloves-off strategy with the president by a nearly two-to-one margin, with just 29% saying they would prefer a more cooperative approach. The tougher posture lands especially well with younger voters: 71% of Californians under 30 say they approve.\nIn a blitz of media appearances last week, Newsom escalated his rhetoric.\n“We’re fighting fire with fire,” he said on The Siren podcast. “And we’re going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.”\nThe response was telling: no Democratic moralizing, no rebuke from party leaders, no pressure on Newsom to apologize. Instead, his team promoted the interview to his legions of new followers and supporters replied with MAGAesque AI images of the governor as a superhero.\n“People are just not used to seeing this kind of rough around the edges, non-poll-tested messaging coming from Democrats,” said Olivia Julianna, a 22-year-old Democratic activist from Texas and social media influencer who interviewed Newsom for the episode. “It’s real, it’s raw, it’s authentic, and it shows that he’s a fighter.”\nAs Democrats brace for the loss of up to five US House seats in her state, under the redistricting plan approved by the Texas legislature on Saturday, Julianna said voters alarmed by Trump’s increasingly brazen power grabs are desperate for leaders who offer more than just fighting words.\n“We want to feel like someone is standing on the frontlines ready to go to battle for us,” she said. “And that’s what it feels like Gavin Newsom is doing.”\nNewsom’s new fight-fire-with-fire strategy isn’t always trained on Trump.\nWhen the Bed Bath & Beyond chair announced on Wednesday that he wouldn’t reopen stores in the state, calling it “overregulated, expensive and risky”, Newsom’s press office fired back. “After their bankruptcy and closure of every store, like most Americans, we thought Bed, Bath & Beyond no longer existed,” it said. “We wish them well in their efforts to become relevant again.”\nHe’s also taken on his own party. Earlier this year, Newsom declared the Democratic brand “toxic” in an interview with provocateur Bill Maher – a diagnosis backed by polling and voter registration trends, but striking language for the leader of the largest blue state who could seek that same party’s nomination.\nHe enraged progressives – already wary of his record on housing and homelessness – when he questioned the fairness of transgender athletes competing in women’s sports. The comments, during a conversation with therightwing agitator Charlie Kirk on the inaugural episode of the governor’s podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, marked a split from other top Democrats on the issue and rattled some of his LGBTQ+ allies.\nIn response to a Guardian story about the loss of care for trans youth in California, a Newsom spokesperson said critics should point the finger at Trump, not at a governor whose “record supporting the trans community is unmatched”.\n“Everyone wants to blame Gavin Newsom for everything. But instead of indulging in Newsom derangement syndrome, maybe folks should look to Washington,” the spokesperson said – invoking a pejorative phrase, “derangement syndrome”, used by Trump supporters to mock the president’s detractors.\nWhile his sharper tone has angered some on the left, the redistricting gambit has managed to unite progressives and establishment Democrats – sending Newsom’s once-stalled approval rating soaring.\nHis redistricting plan has drawn praise from across the party, including Barack Obama, who called it “a responsible approach”, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the entire congressional delegation of California Democrats. With the ballot initiative in motion, he challenged other blue state leaders to follow suit, throwing down the gauntlet for fellow Democratic governors with presidential ambitions as Trump expands his push to secure Republican advantages in states such as Indiana, Ohio and Missouri.\nThat aggressive posture – in effect becoming an “anti-Trump troll” – has been cathartic for many Democrats, Nalder said.\n“Democrats nationwide have been feeling like the Trump administration has been punching their values and their party and democracy itself in the face repeatedly day after day and they’re just ready for somebody to punch the bully back,” she said. “And Newsom right now looks like he could be that guy.”\nNewsom’s campaign faces mounting opposition from Republicans, including those not in Trump’s Maga camp. The popular former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime Trump critic and advocate of independent redistricting, has promised to TERMINATE GERRYMANDERING”.\nFormer House speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has also vowed to pump money into what some observers predict could quickly become one of the most expensive contests in Golden state history.\n“The voters of California have a say,” he said in an interview on CNN. “If you truly believe in your power of your own vote, you should vote against this.”\nNewsom has raised more than $6.2m from 200,000 donations in the week since he officially launched the ballot campaign at a rally in Los Angeles last week, according to his team.\nThere, Newsom stood side by side with labor leaders, members of the teachers union and the head of California’s Planned Parenthood. His redistricting plan even earned the endorsement of Sara Sadhwani, a Democrat who served on California’s 2020 independent redistricting commission. Making the case for tossing out her work, she declared: “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures”.\nAs Newsom spoke at the Japanese American National Museum’s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy earlier this month, federal agents, armed and masked, fanned out across the complex. Newsom said their presence could not have been coincidental, though a Trump administration official called the accusation “misinformed”.\nThe next day, the governor’s office filed a freedom of information request seeking details on the administration’s involvement in the decision to send border patrol agents to that location.\nIt was just more fuel for Newsom’s argument: his campaign is not just about congressional districts, but a referendum on Trump – and American democracy.\n“Donald Trump, you have poked the bear,” Newsom says in a new ad for the redistricting campaign, as the camera flashes to the grizzly on the state’s flag. “And we will punch back.”"

    "raw_text": "The precise timing of Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation announcement – on a Sunday evening – took many by surprise; but the countdown to his departure arguably began just weeks after he took office.\nHaving won the presidency of the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) – a formidable political force that has governed Japan for much of the past seven decades – Ishiba called a snap election in search of a public mandate after a major funding scandal, and to silence his opponents on the right of the party.\nThe gamble was a disaster for Ishiba, who had coveted the top job for much of his career, and a red flag for the once-impregnable LDP, then trying to haul its way out of the same “money politics” mire that came back to haunt it this weekend.\nThe LDP and its junior coalition partner, Komeito, lost their majority in the lower house, forcing the already embattled Ishiba to lead a minority government.\nAfter Ishiba limped through months of soaring rice prices, the return of a tariff-happy Donald Trump and an emboldened North Korea, a second, potentially punishing time at the polls came into view.\nAnd so it turned out. For the second time in less than a year, the LDP was stripped of its majority – this time in upper house elections held in July.\nIn dealing a double whammy to Ishida’s fledgling government, voters made it clear that his party still had much to do to address the funding scandal – in which dozens of LDP lawmakers were found to have siphoned unreported profits from the sale of tickets to party gatherings into slush funds.\nIshiba’s predecessor, Fumio Kishida, apologised in February last year for “inviting suspicion and mistrust” in politics in the wake of the scandal, and promised to stop holding fundraising parties during his time as prime minister. But there has been no concerted show of contrition; Ishiba himself was forced to issue an apology after he gave gift certificates, paid for with his own money, to 15 newly elected LDP members of the lower house – a gesture his critics said was proof of a prevailing culture of monetary rewards in the party.\nAs the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper put it in an editorial days before the upper house poll, lawmakers had “underestimated” the strength of public anger over money in politics.\nIshiba claimed to have made “considerable progress” in addressing the scandal with the abolition of “policy activity expenses,” which do not have to be disclosed, but he and other LDP lawmakers opposed bans on corporate and group donations to party branches.\nThe fact that most of the dozens of politicians and their aides involved in the scandal were never indicted only added to the anger felt by many voters. “There is no sign of self-reflection on the significant loss of trust in politics,” the Mainichi said.\nAnd so on Sunday, the same scandal that had felled his predecessor, Kishida, also brought Ishiba’s premiership to an abrupt end.\nThe LDP has been here before, however – and recovered.\nIn the mid-1990s it reached an improbable accommodation with the socialists, whose leader, Tomiichi Murayama, was installed as prime minister in return for their participation in a three-party coalition. In 2009, the LDP was punished a second time following a slew of scandals that saw it relinquish power to the opposition for the first time since the war.\nAs it braces for a leadership election in early October, the LDP on Monday began its search for a successor with the ability to repeat those feats of resurrection.\n“Having watched the party’s fault lines widen over the past year … party leaders may look for a leader who can promote unity, generate public excitement and support, and work with one or more opposition parties to stabilise the government,” said Tobias Harris, founder of the political risk advisory firm Japan Foresight.\nThe focus on turning around the party’s fortunes could drown out debate on economic and foreign policy, despite concern over rising regional tensions, Trump’s trade war and the cost of living crisis.\nThey “may be less significant as the LDP grapples with an existential crisis that may well still result in the party going into opposition for the third time in its history,” Harris added.\nLast autumn, after Ishiba presided over the LDP’s chastening lower house election results barely a month into his prime ministership, he conceded that voters had issued a “severe judgment” on his party – a phrase he repeated after July’s upper house debacle.\nBut unless the party’s warring factions can quickly regroup – possibly by coalescing around the youthful and media-friendly frontrunner Shinjiro Koizumi – the harshest verdict may be yet to come."

    "raw_text": "Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, is to resign less than a year after taking office, throwing the country’s politics into turmoil and setting in motion a potentially messy contest to replace him as leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP).\nThe softly spoken centrist has presided over two disastrous elections since being elected to lead the LDP last autumn. In October, the party and its junior coalition partner Komeito lost their majority in the lower house and met the same fate in upper house elections this July.\nSpeaking to the media on Sunday evening – a day before his opponents inside the party were expected to attempt to force him out – Ishiba said he would resign to take responsibility for the election debacles, saying he wanted to avoid opening up a “decisive” split in the LDP.\nHe announced the decision at a time of uncertainty for the world’s fourth-biggest economy as it wrestles with the impact on exports of Donald Trump’s tariffs. Last week the US president announced he would lower tariffs imposed on Japanese cars from 27.5% to 15%, in a rare moment of guarded optimism for the embattled Ishiba.\n“Now that negotiations on US tariff measures have reached a conclusion, I believe this is the appropriate moment [to resign],” Ishiba told reporters. “I have decided to step aside and make way for the next generation.”\nOpposition to Ishiba, 68, has mounted in recent weeks, with media reporting that disaffected MPs would attempt to force him out by voting on Monday to bring forward a party presidential election not due until 2027.\nIshiba had reportedly generated even more anger, particularly among those on the right of the LDP, by resisting the move, and threatening instead to call a “put up or shut up” snap election.\nIshiba conceded that he could no longer lead the LDP – a position that automatically makes the holder of that office prime minister as it is the largest single party in the lower house – after talks with senior colleagues on Saturday, the Kyodo news agency reported.\nNow that Ishiba has vowed not to seek re-election in the party contest, attention will turn to his potential successors, with a leadership vote among lawmakers and rank-and-file party members expected to take place in early October.\nSanae Takaichi, the ultra-conservative former economic security minister, who lost to Ishiba in last October’s leadership election, is expected to make another attempt to become Japan’s first female prime minister.\nSome analysts believe the LDP will turn to its youthful and photogenic agriculture minister, Shinji Koizumi, who has led attempts to reduce soaring rice prices since he was appointed in May. As the environment minister, Koizumi, the son of the former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, once insisted the fight against the climate crisis could be “sexy” and “fun”.\nMuch will depend on how lawmakers who have led the charge against Ishiba cast their votes. They include the former prime minister Taro Aso, who remains an influential figure in the LDP, and other MPs who were close to the former prime minister Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated in July 2022.\nIshiba won the LDP presidency at his fifth attempt last October, but was quickly brought back down to earth when his coalition government lost their majority in the powerful lower house later the same month.\nStripped of their majorities in both houses, the coalition must work with opposition parties to pass legislation or face the constant threat of no-confidence motions. Japan’s perennially splintered opposition parties have been unable to exploit the LDP’s predicament to form a grand coalition, however.\nJapan is confronting rising regional tensions, a cost of living crisis and growing public unease over migration that has fuelled a rise in support for the populist Sanseitō party.\nIshiba’s successor will also face the task of restoring public trust in the LDP – which has governed Japan almost without interruption since the mid-1950s – after it was rocked by a major funding scandal.\nA Kyodo poll released on Sunday showed the approval rating for Ishiba’s cabinet had slumped to 32.7% – down 2.7 percentage points from last month."

    "raw_text": "In the past fortnight Fumio Kishida has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the Nobel peace prize and praised for a speech to congress in which he urged the US not to retreat into isolation.\nBut since his return to Tokyo after a successful summit with Joe Biden, Japan’s prime minister has been buffeted by domestic political headwinds that this weekend could spell the beginning of the end of his administration.\nKishida, who came to office in late 2021 promising a “new capitalism”, a more robust Japan on the international stage and solutions to the country’s demographic crisis, faces the toughest test of his premiership when voters go to the polls in three byelections on Sunday.\nHis Liberal Democratic party (LDP) was unable to find candidates for the votes in two constituencies, where the LDP incumbents were tainted by scandal - and is pinning its hopes on the Shimane 1st district.\nThe rural constituency on the coast of the Sea of Japan is considered a conservative stronghold, but it is a measure of the size of the problems facing Kishida that speculation is mounting that his party could be unseated.\nDespite wooing his American audience – a feat that earned him a bump in his approval ratings – Kishida has little else to endear himself or his party to Japanese voters.\nThe yen is in freefall against the dollar, the cost-of-living crisis shows little sign of easing, and there are questions over how to fund policies to address Japan’s low birth rate and its biggest military build-up since the end of the war.\nBut the longest shadow is cast by a funding scandal, first reported last year, that has become a focal point for public anger amid growing doubts about Kishida’s ability to lead the LDP to victory in the next lower house elections.\nWhile that vote is not due for well over a year, the scandal, in which 85 LDP lawmakers were found to have siphoned unreported profits from the sale of tickets to party gatherings into slush funds, has denied Kishida any room for manoeuvre.\nInstead, defeat in Shimane, added to certain victory for non-LDP candidates in Sunday’s other byelections, could trigger an early challenge to his leadership when the party holds presidential elections in September, with the winner automatically made prime minister.\nVictory in the byelection, on the other hand, could give Kishida enough momentum to call a “put up or shut up” snap election this summer.\nBut days before the Shimane vote, Japanese media reported that the LDP candidate, a former finance ministry bureaucrat, was trailing his rival from the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party.\nThat, say analysts, reflects a wider dissatisfaction with Kishida’s administration, whose approval ratings have plunged to record lows well under 30% - the point at which Japanese governments are said to be entering choppy electoral waters.\n“If the LDP loses Shimane … Kishida is likely to come under pressure from within his party in a way that he has not yet experienced since winning the party leadership race [in September 2021],” said James Brady, vice president of the Teneo advisory firm.\n“The party’s response to the slush fund issue has been consistently unconvincing to the public, and there is little reason to think that the planned reforms would change that trend.”\nAttempts to repair the damage inflicted by the funding scandal, and the promise of reform to political funding laws, have also failed to defuse criticism in the media, with one newspaper describing Kishida’s response as “utterly unacceptable”.\nWhile 39 LDP lawmakers were punished, Kishida escaped sanction despite evidence that his own faction had also under-reported ticket sales – apparent double standards that risk sparking a factional power struggle that would leave him bloodied as he attempts to retain his party’s endorsement as LDP president this autumn.\nKishida may have taken comfort from the suggestion last week by the US deputy secretary of state Kurt Campbell that he should be the joint recipient, with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol, of the Nobel peace prize for their attempts to address their countries’ bitter historical legacy and show a united front against nuclear-armed North Korea.\nBut even as he implored the US to overcome “self-doubt” over its global leadership – with a cautious eye on the possible return of Donald Trump – his focus was on the storm that awaited him in Japan.\nGreeted by cheers as only the second Japanese leader to address a joint session of congress – the first was Shinzo Abe – Kishida could not resist a gentle dig at his parliamentary colleagues back home: “I never get such nice applause from the Japanese Diet [Japan’s version of congress].”"

    "raw_text": "Japan’s political future was shrouded in uncertainty on Monday after voters punished the ruling coalition over rising prices and a funding scandal, paving the way for days of wrangling as party leaders try to form a government.\nThe Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and its longtime junior coalition partner Komeito failed to secure a majority in the lower house on a bruising night in which the main opposition Constitutional Democratic party (CDP) made significant gains.\nThe result – which left no single party with a clear mandate – is the LDP’s worst performance since 2009, when it was cast into the wilderness for three years before mounting a comeback under the leadership of Shinzo Abe.\nA chastened prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, who was due to give an address on Monday afternoon, said voters had issued a “severe judgment” against the LDP.\nThey had “expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that acts in line with the people’s will”, he told the public broadcaster NHK.\nUncertainty over whether the coalition can reach a deal with a third party and secure a working majority sent the yen to a three-month low against the dollar on Monday as investors braced for a period of political and economic uncertainty.\nThe LDP and Komeito won a combined 215 seats, down from 279 and well below the 233 they needed to retain their majority. Two cabinet members lost their seats, as did several other candidates implicated in a slush fund scandal that has battered the LDP’s approval ratings in recent months. The biggest winner was the CDP with 148 seats, up from 98.\nHaving seen his snap election gamble fail spectacularly Ishiba must now attempt to cobble together a three-party coalition that could include MPs from the centre-right Democratic party for the People or the populist Japan Innovation party.\nFew analysts expect the opposition parties, which range from conservatives to communists, to unite to form an alternative coalition given their policy differences.\nBut the CDP’s leader, Yoshihiko Noda, said the result was proof that the LDP-Komeito coalition could not continue. “This is not the end, but the beginning,” Noda told a press conference, adding that his party would work with other opposition parties to aim for a change of government.\nUnder Japan’s constitution, the parties now have 30 days to put together a coalition, but pressure is expected to mount on senior politicians to act quickly. The gridlock comes as a time of uncertainty for Japan’s economy, growing concern over China and North Korea, and just days before the U.S. presidential election.\nThere will be questions, too, about the decision by Ishiba, who became prime minister only a month ago, to call an early election while his party was embroiled in a major funding scandal.\n“Whether or not Ishiba resigns as LDP leader today, it seems unlikely that he will survive to lead a new government as prime minister … although it is possible he could stay on as caretaker,” said Tobias Harris, founder of the political risk advisory firm Japan Foresight.\nMasakazu Tokura, the chair of Japan’s most influential business lobby, called for a quick return to political stability for the sake of the economy. “We strongly hope for policy-oriented politics through the establishment of a stable government centred on the LDP-Komeito coalition,” he said in a statement."

    "raw_text": "An attempt to promote friendship between Japan and countries in Africa has transformed into a xenophobic row about migration after inaccurate media reports suggested the scheme would lead to a “flood of immigrants”.\nThe controversy erupted after the Japan International Cooperation Agency, or JICA, said this month it had designated four Japanese cities as “Africa hometowns” for partner countries in Africa: Mozambique, Nigeria, Ghana and Tanzania.\nThe programme, announced at the end of an international conference on African development in Yokohama, will involve personnel exchanges and events to foster closer ties between the four regional Japanese cities – Imabari, Kisarazu, Sanjo and Nagai – and the African nations.\nMedia coverage in the four countries, and Japanese-language references to the articles, have been blamed for triggering an ugly backlash on social media in Japan, along with a wave of angry calls and emails to the Japanese cities’ offices.\nSome critics appeared to believe that “hometown” status meant that people from the African countries would be given special permission to live and work in their Japanese partner cities.\n“If immigrants come flooding in, who is going to take responsibility?” said one social media post.\nOne post on X claiming that Kisarazu was “seriously considering handing over the city to Africans” attracted 4.6m views.\nThe four cities have received thousands of complaints from confused residents. “Our team of 15 officials spent a whole day handling hundreds of phone calls and thousands of emails from residents,” an official in Sanjo told Agence France-Presse.\nThe town has received 350 phone calls and 3,500 emails since Monday, the official said, while Imabari has fielded 460 calls and 1,400 emails from residents asking if the town had adopted a new immigration policy.\nJapan’s chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said the claims were baseless. “There are no plans to promote accepting immigrants or issue special visas,” he told reporters.\nThe cities also attempted to set the record straight. The mayor of Kisarazu, Yoshikuni Watanabe, pointed out that the city had hosted Nigerian athletes during the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, adding that project would not lead to “accepting migrants”.\nHe added: “Our initiatives will involve cooperating in the education of young people based on discipline through baseball and softball, and it’s not a programme that will lead to relocation or immigration.”\nThe mayor of Sanjo, Ryo Takizawa, said in a statement: “It is not true that the city has requested to accept migrants or immigrants from Ghana, and the city has no plans to make such a request in the future.”\nSome attributed the outcry to an article in the Tanzania Times that carried the headline “Japan dedicates Nagai city to Tanzania.”\nThe word “dedicates” was translated on social media into the Japanese word sasageru, which could be interpreted to mean the town was being “sacrificed” to Tanzania, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.\nNigeria’s government also appeared to have misunderstood the details of the programme, describing Kisarazu as a location open to “Nigerians willing to live and work [in Japan]”. Japan’s government, it added, would create a special visa category for skilled people from the West African country.\nJapan’s foreign ministry has reportedly asked the Nigerian government to issue a correction, while JICA – a government agency – said several media organisations had published articles containing “inaccuracies and potentially misleading information”.\n“JICA is currently urging the relevant local media and the African government [sic] to promptly correct the inaccuracies contained in their coverage,” it said on its website."

    "raw_text": "It is an image that, had it been published just a few years ago, would have been dismissed as a piece of mischievous photo-shopping: the leaders of Russia and China, accompanied by the head of a pariah regime whose mission to arm his country with nuclear weapons had been opposed at the United Nations by his two companions.\nBut dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape – Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, crucially, the re-election of Donald Trump – have combined to bring Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un together in what many observers are calling a dramatic redrawing of the global balance of power.\nOn Wednesday morning, the three men led a group of more than 20 world leaders as they strode towards a rostrum in Tiananmen Square in Beijing to watch a “victory day” parade marking the end, eight decades ago, of a global conflict that would soon usher in the first cold war.\nWhen Wednesday’s celebrations end, however, the regimes in Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang will be left to confront significant domestic challenges that might yet shift their focus from global power politics.\nChina’s economy – the world’s second-biggest after the US – is stalling, amid deflationary pressure, slow growth and a collapsing property sector. Russia is refusing to take steps to end its war with Ukraine that has been raging – with mounting losses on both sides – for more than three years.\nWhile North Korea’s economy grew at its fastest pace in eight years in 2024, according to South Korea’s central bank, the uptick was not down to a shift in Kim’s approach but a knock-on effect of his decision to sell huge quantities of missiles and ammunition to Russia. While Kim sizes up the prospects for more engagement with the South’s new liberal president, Lee Jae-myung, his country’s economic prospects are heavily dependent on the course of an unpredictable conflict taking place thousands of kilometres away.\nWhile Xi and Putin have declared a “limitless” partnership, analysts say Beijing is rankled by Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine, and North Korea’s direct support of it. Xi is striving to balance his alliance with both nations, while at the same time avoiding further sanctions from the US and other allies of Ukraine.\nThere is a chance, of course, that Wednesday’s optics will focus the minds of Trump and other western leaders. While he was not on the guest list, the US president indicated he was following events in the Chinese capital.\nIn a barbed post on Truth Social, Trump reminded Xi of the US’s role in defeating Japan 80 years ago, adding: “May President Xi and the wonderful people of China have a great and lasting day of celebration. Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America.”\nSuch was the potent symbolism attached to the first-ever meeting between Xi, Putin and Kim that it threatened to overshadow the huge military parade snaking through the streets of the Chinese capital.\nThe images coming out of Beijing prove that the “axis of upheaval”, with Xi forming its nucleus, has moved beyond hypothesis and into the messy realm of realpolitik.\nJust how a striking photo op will translate into action remains to be seen, but the leaders in capitals from Washington and London to Tokyo and Seoul must surely be looking on with a mixture of curiosity and alarm."

    "raw_text": "Japan's opposition carried off a stunning victory in today's general election, crushing the ruling party and raising hopes of a significant shift in policy after more than half a century of almost unbroken conservative rule.\nHours after the polls closed, the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) had surpassed the 241 seats it needed to win a majority in the 480-seat lower house and oust the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) from power.\nMajor television networks projected that the DPJ, a broadly progressive party whose ranks include socialists as well as former LDP rebels, would secure more than 300 seats, almost triple the number it held going into the election.\nThe incoming prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, will lead Japan's first non-LDP administration since 1993, and only the country's second since 1955.\nSpeaking to jubilant party members in Tokyo, he said he remained committed to the mantra of change that had swept the DPJ into power. \"The people are angry with politics and the ruling coalition,\" he said. \"We keenly felt that people wanted a change in their lives, and so we fought this election for a change in government.\"\nTaro Aso, the outgoing prime minister, indicated he would resign as head of the LDP to take responsibility for a disastrous night that could see the party's strength reduced from 300 seats to just over 100.\n\"These results are very severe,\" he said. \"There is deep dissatisfaction with our party.\" In a potentially intriguing development, those emerging as possible candidates for the LDP presidency included Hatoyama's brother, Kunio, a former justice minister in the Aso administration.\nWith an overwhelming public mandate secured, Hatoyama will quickly come under pressure to make good on his manifesto pledges. He has promised to eliminate wasteful public works, challenge elite bureaucrats' policy stranglehold and invest heavily in social security in one of the world's most elderly societies.\nBut he has come under fire for failing to cost proposals such as free high school education and a 26,000 yen (£170) a month child allowance. Sceptics have also questioned his ability to wrest power from the mandarins who have dictated Japan's postwar economic policy.\nThere is potential, too, for friction with the Washington if Hatoyama pursues an election pledge to end Japan's \"subservience\" to American foreign policy, including plans to halt a refuelling mission in support of US-led forces in Afghanistan.\nIn a New York Times opinion piece, he said the failure of the Iraq war and the global financial crisis proved that \"the era of US-led globalism is coming to an end.\"\nHe added, however, that the US would \"remain the world's leading military and economic power for the next two to three decades\" and he ruled out a radical shift in bilateral ties. The US-Japan alliance, he said, would \"continue to be the cornerstone of Japanese diplomatic policy\".\nAnalysts said the election result heralded a fundamental shift in Japan's conservative-dominated political culture.\n\"This is about the end of the postwar political system in Japan,\" said Gerald Curtis, an expert on Japan at Columbia University in the US. \"It is the only time any party other than the LDP has won a majority in the lower house of the Diet. It marks the end of one long era, and the beginning of another one about which there is a lot of uncertainty.\"\nMuch uncertainty centres on the DPJ's spending commitments as Japan, already saddled with a huge public debt, emerges from its deepest recession since the war.\nRichard Jerram, the chief economist at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo, described Hatoyama's 16.8tn yen investment programme, as a \"quasi-socialist approach\" that would harm Japan's public finances and blunt its competitiveness.\n\"The core of the DPJ's economic policy seems to be a fantasy Robin Hood scheme, aimed at appealing to as many voters as possible,\" he said.\nJapanese newspaper editorials agreed that his first task must be to steer Japan towards sustained economic recovery.\n\"We want to ask the next administration to swiftly deal with concerns about unemployment uncertainty and deflation, which are deepening simultaneously,\" the Nikkei business paper said.\nWhile Aso counted the cost of a year in office bedevilled by gaffes, sleaze and mounting economic woes, Hatoyama was reportedly discussing his cabinet.\nThe administration is expected to include two minor parties, giving the DPJ majorities in both houses of parliament.\nDespite nagging concerns over the DPJ's ability to govern, its extraordinary rise to power appears to have stirred voters out of their disenchantment with politics.\nEarly estimates suggested turnout could exceed the 67.5% seen at the last election, in 2005, but hopes that it could surpass 70% may have been dashed by strong winds and heavy rain brought by an approaching typhoon."

    "raw_text": "Japan’s government is battling record-low approval ratings as consumers voice anger at soaring rice prices just weeks before key national elections.\nAttempts to bring down the price of the Japanese staple have had little effect, prompting calls for a reduction in the consumption (sales) tax to ease the cost-of-living crisis.\nA new poll by the Kyodo news agency found that consumers blamed the administration of the prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, for rising pressure on household finances.\nApproval ratings for Ishiba’s cabinet stand at 27.4%, according to the poll, the lowest since he took office last October and a dip of more than five percentage points in the past month, Kyodo said.\nIshiba’s ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) has so far ruled out a cut in the 10% consumption tax, which promises to be a focal point of upper house elections in July.\nIshiba is already under pressure after the LDP and its junior coalition partner lost their lower house majority last autumn. Significant losses in the upper house will only add to calls from opponents inside the party for him to go.\nAlmost three-quarters of respondents said the tax, which is levied on a wide range of goods and services, should be cut “only for food items”, “for all products” or be abolished altogether, the poll found.\nMore worrying for Ishiba, just over 87% of respondents said government efforts to rein in the price of rice had been “insufficient”, while more than 74% said they did not expect ongoing US-Japan tariff talks – including negotiations on American imports of rice and other foodstuffs – to end favourably to Japan.\nEarlier this year Ishiba’s government took the unusual step of dipping into its vast rice reserves. In March it began releasing stockpiled rice in an attempt to arrest price rises that have been blamed on a combination of factors, including higher demand fuelled in part by the tourism boom, distribution bottlenecks, and suspected hoarding by wholesalers and distributors in anticipation of further shortages.\nBut the move, which is usually reserved for shortages caused by natural disasters and crop failures, did not have the desired effect, with prices of domestic rice falling only marginally.\nThe price of rice sold in supermarkets averaged ¥4,214 ($29) for 5kg during the week to 4 May, according to the agriculture ministry. That is ¥18 cheaper than the all-time high recorded a week earlier, but still around double the price at the same time last year.\nIn response, the government said last week it would double the supply of stockpiled rice, with an additional 300,000 tons due for release in the three months to July, media reports said. That is on top of 300,000 tons that has already been released from emergency stockpiles since March. In addition, some of the rice will bypass wholesalers so it can reach shops more quickly.\nThe mounting rice crisis has forced more Japanese restaurants and consumers to turn to cheaper imports. In April, Japan imported South Korean rice for the first time in a quarter of a century.\nLast week, the supermarket chain Aeon said it would start selling US-produced Calrose rice from early next month. A 4kg bag will cost about 10% less than Japanese rice."

    "raw_text": "With just 10 days to go before Japan’s governing party elects a new leader – who will automatically become prime minister – the contest is still too close to call.\nAmong the frontrunners are Shigeru Ishiba, a model aircraft enthusiast and security policy wonk about to embark on his “final battle”, and Shinjiro Koizumi, the youthful, photogenic son of a former prime minister who once insisted the fight against climate change could be “sexy” and “fun”. The race has been complicated by a new poll in which ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) supporters named Sanae Takaichi, the ultra-conservative economic security minister, as their preferred choice.\nThe current prime minister, Fumio Kishida, blew open the race to lead the LDP – a conservative political powerhouse that has governed almost unchallenged for seven decades – with his surprise decision not to run in the leadership race on 27 September.\nCiting the need for new blood after damaging political and financial scandals, and stubbornly low personal approval ratings, Kishida warned that his successor must lead a “new LDP”.\nUnder Japan’s parliamentary system, the party’s new president, who will be chosen from a record nine candidates, will automatically become prime minister when he – or she – is approved by the LDP-dominated Diet.\nOn Monday, a poll by the Kyodo news agency showed that 63-year-old Takaichi – who played drums in a rock band as a teenager – was viewed by 27.7% of LDP supporters as most suitable to be Japan’s next prime minister, although doubts remain over her ability to garner votes among her lawmaker colleagues.\nThe poll, in which Ishiba received 23.7% support and Koizumi 19.1%, indicates that the leadership vote will have to go to a decisive second round.\nKoizumi has struggled to convert his popularity with voters into a credible bid to become leader of the world’s fourth-biggest economy. Recent polls suggest this attempt, too, could end in failure at the hands of Ishiba, 67, who is attempting to become LDP head at the fifth – and, he says, final – time of asking.\nAn earlier poll by Nikkei financial newspaper and broadcaster TV Tokyo put support for Ishiba at 26%, followed by the 43-year-old Koizumi at 20%, with Takaichi, at 16%.\nEach of the LDP’s 367 lawmakers will cast a vote in the first round, while an equal number of votes will be distributed based on the preferences of just over 1 million grassroots members who must cast their votes by 26 September.\nIn the unlikely event that one candidate secures a simple majority in the first round, he or she will become party leader. But in the absence of a runaway favourite, the two candidates with the most votes will compete in a second round, with each LDP lawmaker getting one vote and membership’s share dropping to 47 votes, one for each of Japan’s prefectures.\nThe old guard v the new\nDespite his lack of success in four previous leadership races, Ishiba is seen as a safe pair of hands able to steer the LDP out of stormy waters, although some analysts believe only victory for Koizumi would prove to voters that the LDP is serious about addressing the fallout from a damaging fundraising scandal.\nKoizumi, a keen surfer who graduated with a Master’s degree in political science from Columbia University, can offer “a nebulous promise of generational change and modernisation of the ruling LDP,” said James Brady, vice-president of the political risk advisory firm Teneo.\nWhile Ishiba could outperform his rival among rank-and-file members, “Koizumi is likely to receive significantly more support from parliamentary colleagues, giving him a real chance of coming top in the first round”, Brady added.\nWhat the softly spoken Ishiba, a member of Japan’s tiny Christian population, lacks in charisma, he makes up for in experience. A strong backer of Taiwanese democracy, he has served as defence minister and supports the creation of an Asian “Nato” to counter security threats from China and North Korea.\nIn some ways, though, Koizumi’s candidacy is a continuation of the status quo. As one of a glut of “hereditary politicians” in Japan’s parliament, much of his public profile rests on the legacy of his father, the silver-haired, Elvis-impersonating Junichiro Koizumi, Japan’s prime minister from 2001-6.\nThe younger Koizumi rose steadily through the LDP ranks, serving as environment minister a decade after he inherited his father’s constituency in Kanagawa prefecture in 2009 – the fourth-generation member of a political dynasty whose involvement in Japanese public life stretches back more than a century.\nKoizumi immediately made waves, telling a UN summit in that in “tackling a big-scale issue like climate change, it’s got to be fun, it’s got to be cool, and it’s got to be sexy, too” – a choice of words some described as frivolous.\nAfter his marriage to the TV presenter Christel Takigawa, he became the first Japanese cabinet minister to take paternity leave – albeit a measly two weeks – after the birth of their first child in 2020.\nKoizumi has displayed similarly “modern” instincts elsewhere. He supports legislation to permit married couples to use separate surnames and to allow women to become reigning empresses, a move also backed by Ishiba.\nWhile his immediate future will be decided by party colleagues and members, Koizumi, who would become Japan’s youngest prime minister since the war, has said he will immediately seek a popular mandate by calling a snap election. “After the money scandal, we won’t get anywhere with our policies unless we face the people’s judgment first,” he said.\nAgencies contributed reporting."

    "raw_text": "'There is death in every home', Kunar resident says after his five children killed by earthquake\nMuhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar’s Nur Gul district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, had been killed in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the rubble.\n“The poor people in this area have lost everything,” he said. “There is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof, there are dead bodies. The mud houses have been wiped away, and destruction is everywhere. People are desperately seeking help.”\nThe death toll from the earthquake that has risen to over 800, the Taliban government spokesperson has said, with the majority of deaths occurring in the remote Kunar province. About 800 people died and 2,500 others were injured in Kunar, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told a press conference in Kabul, adding that the toll of 12 dead and 255 injured in the Nangarhar province had not changed.\nFilippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said the earthquake intensified existing humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan and urged international donors to support relief efforts. “This adds death and destruction to other challenges including drought and the forced return of millions of Afghans from neighbouring countries,” Grandi wrote on the social media platform X.\nRescuers are operating across Afghanistan’s east, with helicopters helping bring the injured to safety, while rubble is combed through in the hunt for survivors. The Taliban interior ministry has said in a statement that the vast majority of deaths occurred in the Kunar region (610), with a further 12 deaths in Nangarhar.\nAn unnamed but high-ranking Taliban official in the Kunar province has told BBC News that the rescue mission is now focused on finding survivors, not the dead. He said that rescue teams have been struggling to reach wounded people because significant numbers are waiting to be airlifted by helicopters as landslides have closed most of roads.\nMore than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking after Sunday’s earthquake, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which recorded at least five aftershocks throughout the night. As a reminder, the magnitude 6 earthquake hit four provinces in eastern Afghanistan around midnight on Sunday, with the rugged, mountainous region of Kunar the worst affected, triggering landslides and flooding.\nThe Afghan Red Crescent said its officials and medical teams have “rushed to the affected areas” of the earthquake and are “providing emergency assistance to impacted families”.\nHumanitarian agencies say they are fighting a forgotten crisis in Afghanistan, where the United Nations estimates more than half the population is in urgent need of humanitarian aid. “So far, no foreign governments have reached out to provide support for rescue or relief work,” a spokesperson of Afghanistan’s foreign office said on Monday.\nRescuers have been battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the Pakistani border, where mudbrick homes dotting the slopes collapsed in the quake. “The area of the earthquake was affected by heavy rain in the last 24-48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides and rock slides is also quite significant - that is why many of the roads are impassable,” Kate Carey, an officer at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Unocha), told Reuters.\nOne resident in Afghanistan’s Nurgal district, one of the worst-affected areas in Kunar, said almost the entire village had collapsed under the force of the earthquake. “Children are under the rubble. The elderly are under the rubble. Young people are under the rubble,” the villager, who did not give his name, told the Associated Press.\nMuhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar’s Nur Gul district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, had been killed in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the rubble. “The poor people in this area have lost everything,” he said. “There is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof, there are dead bodies.”\nOne survivor described seeing homes collapse before his eyes and people screaming for help.\nSadiqullah, who lives in the Maza Dara area of Nurgal, said he was woken by a deep boom that sounded like a storm approaching. Like many Afghans, he uses only one name.\nHe ran to where his children were sleeping and rescued three of them. He was about to return to grab the rest of his family when the room fell on top of him.\n“I was half-buried and unable to get out,” he told the Associated Press by phone from Nangarhar Hospital.\n“My wife and two sons are dead, and my father is injured and in hospital with me. We were trapped for three to four hours until people from other areas arrived and pulled me out.”\nIt felt like the whole mountain was shaking, he said.\nFilippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said the earthquake intensified existing humanitarian challenges in Afghanistan and urged international donors to support relief efforts.\n“This adds death and destruction to other challenges including drought and the forced return of millions of Afghans from neighbouring countries,” Grandi wrote on the social media platform X.\n“Hopefully the donor community will not hesitate to support relief efforts.”\nIt was almost midnight when Hameed Jan was jolted awake in his bed by a deep rumble. Powerful tremors were shaking his small house in Piran village in Afghanistan’s Kunar region and he could see the walls beginning to crack.\n“I jumped out of bed and rushed to where my children and parents were sleeping,” said Jan. “I managed to rescue two of my children and brought them outside to safety. I went back inside to save my younger siblings, but as I did, the roof and walls collapsed around me.”\nAs the magnitude-6 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan late on Sunday night, Jan found himself buried in the rubble of his own house. As much as he tried to claw at the debris, he struggled to push his head through the wreckage. It took local villagers five hours to finally free him. But when he finally broke through, he was greeted with scenes of tragedy and devastation.\nHis wife, two sons and two brothers were among those killed when the powerful earthquake struck, razing entire villages across the region to the ground. In the poverty-stricken, mountainous terrain of Kunar, most homes in the affected villages had been made only of mud, giving people little defence from the debris and floods caused by the earthquake when it struck as they slept. Most homes lay in a pile of rubble or washed away entirely.\n“It felt as if the entire mountain was collapsing on us,” said Jan. “Our village has been completely devastated and residential areas wiped out.”\nAn unnamed but high-ranking Taliban official in the Kunar province has told BBC News that the rescue mission is now focused on finding survivors, not the dead.\nHe said that rescue teams have been struggling to reach wounded people because significant numbers are waiting to be airlifted by helicopters as landslides have closed most of roads.\nHe told the BBC Afghan Service:\nThe scale of devastation is unimaginable, entire villages are flattened, roads to deep mountainous areas are still closed.\nSo now, for us, the priority is not finding dead under the rubble, but rather reaching out to those injured.\nThe official added:\nMost of the dead bodies are under rubble.\nWe are doing everything, but it doesn’t seem possible soon.\nHumanitarian agencies say they are fighting a forgotten crisis in Afghanistan, where the United Nations estimates more than half the population is in urgent need of humanitarian aid.\n“So far, no foreign governments have reached out to provide support for rescue or relief work,” a spokesperson of Afghanistan’s foreign office said on Monday.\nLater, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said it was ready to provide disaster relief assistance “according to Afghanistan’s needs and within its capacity”.\nMeanwhile, foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar of India said it had delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food material to Kunar, with more relief material to be sent from India starting Tuesday.\nRescuers have been battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the Pakistani border, where mudbrick homes dotting the slopes collapsed in the quake.\n“The area of the earthquake was affected by heavy rain in the last 24-48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides and rock slides is also quite significant - that is why many of the roads are impassable,” Kate Carey, an officer at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Unocha), told Reuters.\nRescue teams and authorities are trying to dispose of animal carcasses quickly so as to minimise the risk of contamination to water resources, Carey said.\nCasualties could rise as rescue teams access more isolated locations, authorities said.\n'There is death in every home', Kunar resident says after his five children killed by earthquake\nMuhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar’s Nur Gul district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, had been killed in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the rubble.\n“The poor people in this area have lost everything,” he said. “There is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof, there are dead bodies. The mud houses have been wiped away, and destruction is everywhere. People are desperately seeking help.”\nMore than 1.2 million people likely felt strong or very strong shaking after Sunday’s earthquake, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), which recorded at least five aftershocks throughout the night.\nAs a reminder, the magnitude 6 earthquake hit four provinces in eastern Afghanistan around midnight on Sunday, with the rugged, mountainous region of Kunar the worst affected, triggering landslides and flooding.\nThe earthquake’s epicentre was about 27km (17miles) away from the bustling trade city of Jalalabad, Afghanistan’s fifth-largest city, and around 140km (87 miles) from the capital Kabul.\nAs my colleagues Haroon Janjua andHannah Ellis-Petersen report in this story, the earthquake was shallow, taking place close to the Earth’s surface, which is known to cause greater destruction.\nSince the return of the Taliban in 2021, foreign aid to Afghanistan has been slashed, undermining the already impoverished countries’ ability to respond to disasters such as this one.\nAbout 85% of the Afghan population lives on less than one dollar a day, according to the UN development programme.\nRescue efforts after Afghanistan earthquake kills more than 800 people – video\nHere is a video of the aftermath of the earthquake, which triggered landslides and flooding after hitting Afghanistan’s eastern Kunar province overnight:\nThe number of Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan surged after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in 2021.\nSince returning to power, the militant Islamists have banned women from paid work and girls from secondary education, as well as issuing a series of edicts that ban women from many areas of public life, including walking in parks and even speaking in public.\nMany people have fled to neighbouring countries to escape the oppressive regime, often without proper documentation.\nPakistan has taken in Afghans through decades of war, but officials say the country’s public services can’t cope with the influx and have, along with Afghanistan, stepped up deportations in recent months.\nAt least 1.2 million Afghans have been forced to return to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan so far this year, according to a June report by UNHCR.\nAfghans living in Iran have been leaving in large numbers since October 2023, when authorities announced a crackdown on foreigners who it said were in the country illegally. Israel’s war with Iran over the summer forced many to flee as Israeli airstrikes targeted the country.\nAfghanistan already suffering from 'multiple crises' on top of earthquake, UN official says\nAfghanistan is already suffering a “multiplicity of crises” under the Taliban-run government, the UN’s high commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has told Sky News in an interview.\nGrandi said the unfolding situation in the country was “very tragic” as Afghanistan is already suffering from a “big drought” while Iran has “sent back almost 2 million people” and Pakistan “threatens to do the same”.\n“We have very little information as of yet, but already, reports of hundreds of people killed and many more made homeless,” he said.\n“It’s extremely difficult to mobilise resources because of the Taliban. So it’s a perfect storm,” Grandi added.\nMore than 800 people killed by earthquake, Afghan government says\nThe death toll from the earthquake that has risen to over 800, the Taliban government spokesperson has said in an update, with the majority of deaths occurring in the remote Kunar province.\nAbout 800 people died and 2,500 others were injured in Kunar, spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told a press conference in Kabul, adding that the toll of 12 dead and 255 injured in the Nangarhar province had not changed."

    "raw_text": "It was almost midnight when Hameed Jan was jolted awake in his bed by a deep rumble. Powerful tremors were shaking his small house in Piran village, in Afghanistan’s Kunar region, and he could see the walls beginning to crack.\n“I jumped out of bed and rushed to where my children and parents were sleeping,” Jan said. “I managed to rescue two of my children and brought them outside to safety. I went back inside to save my younger siblings, but as I did the roof and walls collapsed around me.”\nAs the magnitude-6 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan late on Sunday night, Jan found himself buried in the rubble of his own house. As much as he tried to claw at the debris, he struggled to push his head through the wreckage. It took villagers five hours to finally free him. When he finally broke through, he was greeted with scenes of tragedy and devastation.\nHis wife, two sons and two brothers were among the dead after the powerful earthquake had razed entire villages across the region to the ground. In the poverty-stricken, mountainous terrain of Kunar, most homes in the affected villages had been made only of mud, giving people little defence from the debris and floods caused by the earthquake when it struck as they slept. Most homes lay in piles of rubble or had been washed away entirely.\n“It felt as if the entire mountain was collapsing on us,” Jan said. “Our village has been completely devastated and residential areas wiped out.”\nThe official death toll stood at 800 on Monday evening, with more than 2,500 injured, and was widely expected to rise significantly. Many in the villages of Kunar remained unaccounted for and rescuers continued to pull bodies from the rubble as all local hospitals declared a state of emergency.\nThe Taliban, who took control of the country more than four years ago when its internationally recognised government collapsed, dispatched helicopters but many areas remained impossible to access.\nSanaullah, another resident of Kunar province, had been away from his village when the earthquake struck. When he travelled back on Monday, he found that his house had been reduced to rubble and his brother had been killed alongside his five children. “It is the story of each and every house here,” he said. “Everyone I know here has lost at least three to five family members.”\nAbdul Rahim, a cleric in Kunar, said graveyards in Mazar valley in Kunar were now overflowing with the dead. “Everywhere people are crying and embracing one another following a mass funeral,” he said. “The death toll is so high that graveyards are overflowing, and local people are busy digging graves in advance as bodies arrive every half hour.”\nMany of those affected were critical of the rescue efforts by the Taliban, which was widely seen to lack the resources, manpower and funds to deal with a crisis on this scale. Since the Taliban retook power in 2021, it has become increasingly difficult for NGOs to operate in the country, particularly amid the draconian ban on women’s employment and education, and most foreign governments have withdrawn aid from Afghanistan, now one of the poorest countries in the world.\nSohail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesperson, called on international organisations to step in and offer assistance in the wake of the disaster. “Many villages are not accessible yet,” he said. “I fear the casualties are very high.”\nOne resident from the Maza Dara area, who asked to remain anonymous to speak freely, criticised the Taliban rescue efforts. “There are women and children pleading for help but there are no authorities present to help them,” he said.\n“Everyone is trapped under the rubble and we are helpless and seeing them dying in front of our eyes,” he added. “There is no one here to help those buried and alive in the debris. There is no one here to remove the dead.”"

    "raw_text": "A powerful earthquake that hit mountainous eastern Afghanistan has left at least 800 people confirmed dead and injured about 2,500, Taliban officials have said as rescuers struggled to reach the worst-hit villages.\nThe magnitude-6 earthquake struck several provinces close to the Pakistan border around midnight on Sunday, with the rugged region of Kunar the most severely affected. There were landslides and flooding.\nThe earthquake was shallow, taking place close to Earth’s surface, which is known to cause greater destruction. Several aftershocks were reported throughout the night and into Monday morning, which could even be felt in the capital, Kabul, more than 100 miles away.\nThe Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed that the death toll had exceeded 800 by Monday afternoon and that rescue efforts were continuing to recover those trapped beneath mud and debris. However, those efforts were hampered as roads to affected areas were destroyed or blocked by rubble from the earthquake, and the terrain of the region is steep and treacherous.\nThe death toll is expected to rise significantly as local hospitals reported being inundated with casualties, and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for. Medics at the provincial hospital in Asadabad in Kunar described the situation as an overwhelming crisis, with new patients arriving every few minutes.\nRasheed Khan, a 40-year-old cloth merchant in Kabul originally from Kunar’s Watpur village, said his wife, children and brothers were among the dead. “It’s doomsday for me. I have lost my wife, three children and two brothers, and I don’t know what has happened to my other relatives and fellow villagers,” he said while returning to his native village from the capital.\n“I fear thousands still remain trapped under the rubble, and I don’t know if they will be saved or not,” Khan said.\nAfghanistan’s defence ministry said it had dispatched 30 doctors and truckloads of medicine to Kunar to assist local hospitals, according to the state-run Bakhtar news agency.\nThe Taliban urged humanitarian organisations to assist with rescue efforts in areas that could only be reached by air because of the landslides and flooding. Officials emphasised the urgent need for field hospitals, medical aid, rescue equipment, shelter, food and clean drinking water.\nSince the Taliban retook control of Afghanistan in 2021 and installed a hardline regime – including heavy restrictions on women’s employment and education – there has been a significant withdrawal of foreign aid and assistance to the country. This has pushed the country’s healthcare system to the brink of collapse and severely undermined its capacity to respond to disasters.\nJeremy Smith, the country manager for Afghanistan for the Red Cross, which is taking part in the rescue operation, said the remote location of the earthquake made efforts particularly challenging. “There have been repeated aftershocks and more are feared in the coming days,” he said.\nKunar is a poor, mountainous region where homes are primarily constructed of mud and rocks. The epicentre of the earthquake was close to the bustling trade city of Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan. Swaths of the city’s buildings are low-rise and informal constructions, mostly made of concrete and brick, which are particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.\nMuhammad Aziz, a labourer from Kunar’s Nur Gul district, said 10 of his relatives, including his five children, were killed in the earthquake and many people from his village remained trapped under the rubble.\n“The poor people in this area have lost everything,” he said. “There is death in every home, and beneath the rubble of each roof there are dead bodies. The mud houses have been wiped away and destruction is everywhere. People are desperately seeking help.”\nThere were reports that some remote villages were yet to receive any rescue assistance due to damaged access routes. Rescue workers in Nur Gul said a journey usually of two hours to reach one village, Masood, was now taking eight while many other villages could be accessed only on foot.\nNearly everyone in Masood has lost family members, and many people are believed trapped under the rubble. Rescue workers said the death toll could be as high as 250.\nIn Laghman province, officials reported at least 30 injuries, mostly among women. Tremors were also felt in Nuristan, but damage assessments there are still pending.\nThe disaster comes with Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, already in the midst of a severe economic crisis, exacerbated by the suspension of US foreign aid earlier this year, which has forced hospitals and health clinics to shut down.\nThe country is also grappling with the impact of the forced return of more than 2 million Afghan nationals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. According to the United Nations, more than half of Afghanistan’s 42 million population is already in need of humanitarian assistance.\nChina said it was ready to provide disaster relief assistance “according to Afghanistan’s needs and within its capacity” and India said it had delivered 1,000 family tents to Kabul and was moving 15 tonnes of food material to Kunar, with more to be sent from Tuesday.\nThe UN secretary general, António Guterres, said its mission in Afghanistan was preparing to help those in areas devastated by the quake. Pope Leo sent condolences for the dead.\nAfghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. A series of earthquakes in its west killed more than 1,000 people last year.\nA magnitude-6.3 earthquake struck Afghanistan on 7 October 2023, followed by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government estimated that at least 4,000 people died. The UN gave a far lower death toll of about 1,500. It was the deadliest natural disaster to strike Afghanistan in recent memory."

While the number of clicks on an article can help us understand the possible importance or popularity of an article on a given topic, it’s just as important for us to get a sense of the quality of a piece and the time readers spend with it can help us gauge that.\nAlong with many other sites, the Guardian has for a long time shown readers the pieces other people are clicking on in the form of a “Most viewed” list. But these lists often don’t include wonderful journalism on topics more off the beaten track. The “Deeply read” list uses attention time to surface a wider range of journalism that other readers are spending more time with. It appears on our regionalised home pages and reflects the interests of the region’s audience.\nNot all of these pieces are long. To power the list we created a metric that looks at the attention time from readers compared with the length of the piece. This means that the list is diverse in terms of topic, length and format.\nWe hope you enjoy the increased variety and depth of the pieces you find here."

    "raw_text": "Don’t Panic! Don’t Panic! Over the weekend the newly promoted Darren Jones, Keir Starmer’s very own Keir Starmer tribute act, was out and about on the airwaves trying to convince everyone – himself included – that the government was not in crisis.\nWhat do you mean, chaos, he said time and again as the questions kept on coming. Each time sounding slightly more chippy. He’s not a man who takes kindly to even a hint of mockery. Darren takes Darren extremely seriously.\nIt was perfectly normal for Angela Rayner – the housing secretary, deputy prime minister and deputy leader of the Labour party rolled into one – to be forced to resign after failing to pay the correct stamp duty. The kind of thing that could happen at any time to any cabinet minister. Hell, the Tories did that the whole time.\nDarren even had Rayner’s exit pencilled into his government spreadsheet. A deputy leadership election was just what Labour and the country wanted. It would be great for all the candidates to make the case for how well things had gone over the past year.\nIt was perfectly normal for Starmer to have conducted an extensive reshuffle after just over a year in office. One that was basically an admission that most of the cabinet had been given the wrong jobs first time round. That half the cabinet had been fairly hopeless but needed to be given another chance in a different department because all the other MPs would be even worse. Besides, they would all be more of a liability to the government mouthing off their resentments from the backbenches.\nSo, everything was about as great as it could possibly be. Hell, Labour had been given a five-year term, so it was perfectly OK to waste the first 12 months by getting things wrong. No one expected the government to hit the ground running. Everyone should just chill out a bit.\nKeir now had the women and men in place that he had really always wanted. And if the Labour government had tilted a bit to the right, then so be it. After all, it wasn’t as if there was any significant threat to Labour from the left, was there?\nAll was for the best in the best of all possible worlds. We should be more grateful to the government for what it was doing, rather than complaining from the sidelines. If people didn’t have something supportive to say, then they should just keep quiet. Stop moaning about things they don’t understand. Keir had a plan for delivery. And what he was planning to deliver was no less than delivery itself. You should applaud the burning sense of mission. Not try to understand it.\nFair to say that not everyone was onboard with the new reality. Not even all Labour MPs were trying to pretend everything was hunky dory. Previously loyally silent backbenchers were now becoming more vocal about the government’s direction.\nSo it was no surprise on Monday that Stella Creasy used an urgent question to highlight the 800 people who had been arrested for protesting about the government’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation. Surely the police had better things to do with their time than locking up peaceful vicars, retired grandmothers and hospital consultants?\nIdeally it should have been the new home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, to reply for the government. But she was away at the Five Eyes conference damning her predecessor with faint praise: Yvette Cooper had done an OK job, she supposed, as far as she had gone. Which wasn’t nearly far enough.\nIt was left to the security minister, Dan Jarvis, to take her place. Dan is a decent bod. There isn’t anyone on either side of the house who dislikes him. He always does his best to try to do the right thing and be nice to everyone. But he’s not the sharpest and if he has a fault, it’s that he’s always too willing to believe what his superiors tell him. Which, as far as Labour are concerned, makes him an ideal person to be junior minister. He can be trusted to repeat the party line for as long as it takes. He knows that thinking for himself is well above his pay grade.\nIt was like this, said Dan. No matter that the Ministry of Defence had at first declared the damage Palestine Action had caused to planes as vandalism. Dan had now been informed that they were an extremely dangerous terrorist organisation. Worse than al-Qaida. Worse than Islamic State.\nThe country was on the very brink of collapse. And it was pure ageism to suggest that because so many old people had been on the march that they weren’t a danger to the fabric of society. Geriatrics were the most lethal of all terrorists. Because they had so much less to lose than the young, old people would happily blow themselves – and us – up without a second thought. Nobody should ever trust a pensioner ever again. Using their triple-locked payments to fund extremism.\n“The country should trust the government,” said Dan. It knew what it was doing. The people understood. Except they didn’t. Not even the Commons was in agreement. Just about the only person fully behind Desperate Dan was the synaptically challenged Chris Philp, who would happily lock up his own family if he thought there were votes in it.\nAlmost everyone else, Labour, Tory and Lib Dems, were minded to think the government had made a bad call. Conservative Julian Lewis put it best. Palestine Action supporters were almost certainly violent and criminal. But that didn’t make them terrorists as well.\nThat just left Richard Tice. The Reform deputy leader wasn’t bothered about any niceties. All this nitpicking about the definition of terrorism was pure woke-ism. As far as he was concerned we should be locking up anyone who was even loosely associated with Palestine Action. If all these pensioners with too much time on their hand hadn’t done anything wrong yet, it was only a matter of time before they did.\nAt which point you wondered why Dicky had never called for Lucy Connolly, the darling of last weekend’s Reform conference, to be re-arrested. Surely calling for migrants to be burned alive must fit his definition of terrorism."

He replaced Matthew Doyle, who had the role for years in opposition. He departs after less than a year, after a summer in which Nigel Farage grabbed at least 22 front pages, with very little to show from the government.\nLiz Lloyd\nDirector of policy, delivery and innovation\nLloyd will leave for another role in government after months in No 10 where her focus was delivery. Lloyd had been Blair’s deputy chief of staff but clashed with the soft-left thinktank graduates in the policy unit, including Ingham. Insiders complained that it had long been unclear who was fully in charge of policy – Ingham or Lloyd.\nOlaf Henricson-Bell\nDirector of the No 10 policy unit\nA senior civil servant, Henricson-Bell will stay in government but is expected to move to a new role, having previously been at the Treasury. Henricson-Bell is the twin brother of Torsten Bell, the pensions minister, and it has been a long-running Westminster joke that the twins could one day end up running the Treasury as chancellor and permanent secretary."

    "raw_text": "A former Labour justice secretary has warned that Reform UK will continue to rise in opinion polls unless the government moves faster to close hotels housing people seeking asylum.\nOn Friday, the government won a court of appeal challenge against an injunction by Epping Forest district council that would have resulted in 130 asylum seekers being moved out of the Bell hotel. In recent weeks the hotel has become the focus of repeated protests, some of which have been orchestrated by far-right extremists and have turned violent.\nDespite the technical victory for the Home Office, as other local councils could have brought legal challenges against the use of hotels if the appeal had not been successful, ministers are braced for further legal battles.\nCharlie Falconer, who served as lord chancellor and justice secretary under Tony Blair, said the government was right to take the Epping case to the court of appeal but that people wanted action to close asylum hotels.\nHe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ve obviously got to move forward in relation to closing the hotels and also stopping the crossings.\n“The government always has the burden of doing what’s possible and the government is doing the right thing in relation to it, but there’s a lot more to do, and if we don’t, as a government, do it, then you’ll see those opinion polls raised yet further for Reform, because they don’t have the burden of having to be practical.”\nReform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has consistently led in opinion polls since the spring, with the latest BMG poll for the i newspaper putting the party on 35%, 15 points ahead of Labour.\nLord Falconer rejected suggestions that the UK might have to pull out of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) to be able to efficiently remove people with no right to be in the country, saying it would be damaging because it would mean “deporting people back into danger”.\n“It does not mean that you can do nothing. You’ve got to think of ways of deterring people from coming here. The obligation that we’ve got is not to deport into danger. That doesn’t mean that you can’t, for example, deport to third countries.”\nAfter the decision on Friday, the Home Office minister Angela Eagle said: “We inherited a chaotic asylum accommodation system costing billions. This government will close all hotels by the end of this parliament and we appealed this judgment so hotels like the Bell can be exited in a controlled and orderly way that avoids the chaos of recent years that saw 400 hotels open at a cost of £9m a day.”\nThe Refugee Council’s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said using hotels to house asylum seekers was “untenable”, adding: “Waiting until 2029 to end their use is no longer an option. As long as hotels remain open, they will continue to be flashpoints for protests, fuelling division and leaving people who have fled war and persecution feeling unsafe.”\nThe charity urged ministers to adopt its “one-off” scheme that would grant temporary permission to stay to those asylum seekers most likely to be recognised as refugees because of the situation in their home country. This would lead to the closure of hotels by next year, according to its own analysis.\nOn Friday night, two men were arrested and charged after a protest outside the Bell hotel, Essex police said.\nRoss Ellis, 49, of Orchard Croft, Harlow, was charged with failing to provide a specimen and was due to appear at Chelmsford magistrates court on Saturday.\nJimmy Hillard, 52, of Chequers Road, Loughton, was charged with assaulting an emergency worker and is due to appear at Chelmsford magistrates court on Monday.\nA third man arrested on suspicion of violent disorder remained in custody.\nProtests are scheduled to continue throughout the weekend. On Saturday, about 200 people gathered outside a hotel in Stockport for a protest billed as “Save Our Kids”. Many were draped in St George’s flags or union jacks; one man wore a T-shirt that read “Enoch Powell was right.”\nProtesters gathered on the playing fields outside the hotel before marching to the back of the building, apparently to get nearer to the rooms where the asylum seekers have been staying.\nOne man shouted: “Where are you, Mohammed?”, while another shouted: “Pop the boats.” Teenagers directed their middle fingers towards the bedrooms.\nMany families have been housed in the hotel over the past two years, with their children attending local schools.\nOne man, whose shirt read “I only kneel for the queen, the fallen and to take aim”, led a mass singalong of “If you don’t like our country, fuck off home” to the tune of She’ll Be Coming Round the Mountain.\nAsked whether he was concerned about intimidating the hotel residents, he said: “By what? A 70-year-old fucking Englishman. They are not intimidated. They are fighting-aged men. Are you telling me that they’re scared of us? We’re scared of them.”\nHe added: “We’re at war.” Asked what the war was, he replied: “Between Islam and Christianity.”\nThe protest was called by Wayne Bentley, an electrician and army veteran, who said: “Somebody had to step up and do something to tell the people of Stockport that our children are not safe on the streets of Stockport.”\nThrough a megaphone, he referred to an incident in which a man living in a hotel in Manchester allegedly tried to kidnap a 10-year-old girl in a Stockport park.\nEdris Abdelrazig, 30, from Sudan, was charged with attempted child abduction on 13 July. He denies the charges and will go on trial next year.\nBentley mentioned another two alleged incidents, neither of which have been linked to asylum seekers living in the hotel outside of which he was protesting.\nOne incident allegedly involved a man seen “filming children playing on the park”. A photograph purporting to show the man being taken away by police was circulated widely online afterwards. No one was charged in connection with the incident because no crimes had been identified, according to Greater Manchester police (GMP). The man was not a resident at the hotel.\nBentley also told the crowd of an incident involving an “innocent woman” who was attacked in woods near the hotel. After the alleged attack in April, police issued an efit showing a man with dark hair and full beard. No one has been charged in connection with the incident and investigations continue, according to GMP."

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer has appointed the outspoken founder of Octopus Energy as an adviser, with a remit to challenge government thinking.\nGreg Jackson has joined the Cabinet Office board, an influential core of government advisers, as a non-executive member.\nThe announcement comes weeks after ministers ruled out his plan to split the national energy market into regional zones, which would have meant users in different areas would pay different rates for their electricity.\nThe tech entrepreneur, who has long had links to the Labour party, responded to that decision by saying he would “respectfully disagree”.\nJackson failed to win over ministers after a long and controversial campaign, in part because zonal pricing would have meant higher energy prices in the south-east of England and lower prices in Scotland.\nHe claimed that electricity prices that reflected local supply and demand dynamics would encourage heavy electricity users to relocate to areas that have more renewable energy generation such as Scotland and encourage renewables developers to base their projects closer to where their energy was needed.\nJackson is now expected to play an influential role in shaping how future government policies are implemented. His non-executive role is one of a number that are understood to have been introduced to bring in expertise from outside government to help civil servants gain a strategic perspective on policy decisions.\nJackson is expected to use his three-year term on the Cabinet Office board to push the government to modernise. The tech founder, who set up Octopus in 2015, has won respect in Westminster after building the energy supplier’s global reach to secure a valuation of £9bn for the company in less than a decade.\nHe has maintained strong links in the government after previously serving as head of the pressure group Labour List. He met the new Labour government alongside Octopus colleagues 10 times in the 12 weeks after the election, according to official records first reported by Politico.\nHe told the Guardian: “Having been brought up with a sense of civic duty, I’m really proud to have the chance to contribute to public service. Finding ways to improve services without spending more is key to public services, the economy and our society, and if through business I’ve learned lessons on technology, delivery and organisation that can be useful to government, it’s an honour to share those.”"

    "raw_text": "Keir Starmer’s lead negotiator on Europe has enthused about how excited he is by the prospect of an EU youth mobility scheme, as he signalled a broader government shift towards embracing closer ties with the bloc.\nNick Thomas-Symonds, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of negotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU, said on Wednesday he was looking forward to signing a deal to let young people travel and work more freely across Europe.\nHis tone contrasted with that struck just a few months ago, when the government would not even say whether it was willing to enter negotiations over such a scheme.\nHe made the comments during a speech in which he promised to agree a new agricultural export deal by the start of 2027, as ministers begin to talk more openly about their desire to move closer to Brussels.\n“I’m very excited that the youth experience [scheme] gives us great opportunities for Brits to be able to go overseas to experience different cultures. Its going to be fantastic,” Thomas-Symonds said.\n“I would say to parliamentary colleagues, it’s going to be all about MPs of all parties actually showcasing the opportunities of young British people.”\nThomas-Symonds has led negotiations over Starmer’s reset in EU relations, which culminated earlier this year in an agreement to start talks over both an agricultural deal and a youth mobility scheme.\nHe said on Wednesday he wanted to have the new export agreement in place by the start of 2027, giving the government 18 months to complete the negotiations.\nBritish officials will be pushing for exemptions to EU rules such as restrictions on developing genetically modified crops, while France, in particular, is likely to ask the government to drop its pre-election pledge to ban imports of foie gras.\nThomas-Symonds admitted the UK would be asking for carve-outs from European rules, but said that Britain would seek to “dynamically align” with the EU, meaning its regulations will change in line with European ones in the future.\nThe principle of dynamic alignment was for many years a bete noire for Brexit supporters, who said it would mean ceding control of British regulations to Brussels. Thomas-Symonds sought to make a virtue of it, however, saying: “We are choosing to align with common high standards because it is in our national economic interest and will save businesses up and down the country.”\nHis warm words about a youth mobility scheme were a departure from recent ministerial reluctance to discuss such a possibility for fear of reopening the debate over free movement from the EU.\nIt reflects an increasing confidence in Labour circles that they can win the argument over European relations, even as they worry about how to combat Nigel Farage’s message on immigration.\n“Nigel Farage can’t bring himself to have any relationship with the EU … because Nigel Farage wants Britain to fail,” Thomas-Symonds said.\nAsked, however, to rebut Farage’s comments on Tuesday that asylum seekers had mounted an “invasion” of Britain, the minister said: “We all use our own, language. I wouldn’t use Nigel Farage’s language.”"

    "raw_text": "As anyone with even a trace of a regional dialect who has had to pay a parking fine can attest, voice recognition services struggle with accents. Now, people in Mark Sewards’ constituency in Leeds are likely to find the same problem with his AI variant.\nA chatbot billed as the first AI version of an MP responds in Sewards’ voice with advice, support or by offering to pass on a message to his team – but only if it understands you.\nThe website, a virtual representation of the MP for Leeds South West and Morley – complete with a Pixar-style cartoon – was launched by a local startup to field questions from his constituents, some of whom have broad Leeds accents.\nI was interested to see how “Sewardsbot” would handle a conversation with someone from only a couple of miles away from his constituency border.\nSummoning my “home” voice (the one I had before it was adulterated by university, several years living in London, and many conversations with Guardian colleagues from East Sussex), I begin a conversation.\n“Hi. I’m AI Mark Sewards, Labour MP for Leeds South West and Morley, can I help you today?” the character says, in Sewards’ voice.\n“Now then,” I begin. My words appear on the screen, and while the bot doesn’t seem to understand it as a greeting – “now then” means “hello” in most of Yorkshire – it fills the gap in the conversation, asking for my name and contact details.\nThe AI version of Seward records all the conversations, with the aim that his team will be able to pick out the key topics that his constituents are talking about – something it has been criticised for.\nSpeaking of key topics, I go straight in with what is on many people’s minds: the horrendous images and video coming out of Palestine. “Are you gonna do summat about Gaza? Y’ant got it right Mark, love,” I say.\nSewardsbot handles this well, understanding that I’m broadly talking about Gaza, though doing nothing to explain the government’s position.\nA message on the website had warned me: “AI Mark is a prototype digital assistant – this is a work in progress and not everything it says should be taken as fact. All responses are AI-generated.”\nI try a few other phrases to see if I can throw it off with colloquialisms, asking if someone can call me, but that I’m at work “nine while half five so I can’t be ont’ phone” until after, and telling it I was “chuffed” to have had a chip butty in a nice breadcake in his constituency.\nIts interpretation of my accent is terrible and much of it is transcribed as unreadable gobbledegook. Unlike a human, it doesn’t understand that the glottal stop used in front of words means “the”, although it manages to get the gist.\nSo I decide to ask the kind of problem a constituency MP might be requested to solve – even if it’s not their responsibility. “Me neighbour’s lad’s blocked’t ginnel at’t back wi an old settee and he won’t do owt about it. If someone dun’t come for it, it’s going in’t road,” I say.\nI suspect Sewards himself would tell me to contact Leeds city council about flytipping, instead the AI tells me I need to speak to the police to report an abandoned vehicle.\nMPs’ aides will no doubt be sighing in relief – they’ve got nowt to worry about just yet."

    "raw_text": "Truth, the progressive California politician Hiram Johnson once said, is the first casualty of war. His oft-cited remark was supposedly made in 1918 in reference to the first world war, which had by then caused millions of human casualties.\nMore than a century later, truth is again caught in the crossfire, this time as a casualty of 21st-century culture wars.\nIf Donald Trump is the high priest of disinformation, then Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform, is showing signs of being a willing disciple, if his behaviour in the UK this week is anything to go by.\nFarage has proposed sending prisoners abroad – including to El Salvador, where the Trump administration has sent hundreds of deportees and suggested sending US citizens. He also suggested an extensive police recruitment drive and prison-building programme all while cutting health and education spending.\nThe parroting of Trump’s policies by a UK populist has not gone unnoticed in the US. And for those who have studied the president’s modus operandi, there is one particular tactic the British public should be braced for: the blizzard of lies and false statements that frequently overwhelms his opponents.\nThe Trump experience, they say, contains sobering lessons for Farage’s critics.\nUS pro-democracy campaigners says Trump has become even harder to factcheck since his first term, thanks to a combination of factors including looser social media content moderation and a reluctance among some media owners to stand up to his intimidation.\nThe Washington Post, which tracked more than 30,000 lies or misleading statements from Trump during his presidency, lost subscribers and public trust after its billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, reportedly vetoed an editorial endorsing the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president.\n“It’s become more difficult because there’s less commitment from those who are in the best position to do the factchecking,” said Omar Noureldin, a senior vice-president for Common Cause, a non-partisan group. “Seeking the truth here comes with costs and risks.”\nComplicating matters is the loss of trust in institutions, with many consumers relying on social media platforms for news.\n“Even the best factchecking can be unpersuasive, because we’re not just facing an information crisis here, but also a trust crisis in the American information ecosystem,” Noureldin said.\nMedia watchers say the political environment has become so deeply polarised that factchecking can even have the counter-productive effect of further entrenching misplaced beliefs.\n“From a lot of research, we’re reaching the conclusion that factchecking hasn’t been as effective as one would want,” said Julie Millican, the vice-president of Media Matters for America, a media watchdog.\n“One reason is that information and disinformation spreads faster than you can check it. It takes a lot longer to factcheck something than it does for it go viral.\n“But the other thing is factchecking can backfire. People so distrust institutions that factchecking can validate the misinformation in their minds and make them more inclined to believe the lie they believed in the first place.”\nA 2022 report from Protect Democracy suggests this is the result of a deliberate strategy of authoritarian regimes.\n“Disinformation is spread through coordinated networks, channels and ecosystems, including politically aligned or state-owned media,” the report said. “The goal is not always to sell a lie, but instead to undermine the notion that anything in particular is true.”\nFurther complicating the problem in the US has been Trump’s appointment of allies to key government agencies that have traditionally served as sources of accurate and reliable data for factcheckers.\nA case in point is Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has engaged in anti-vaccine theories. As Trump’s pick for health and human services secretary, he is in charge of the country’s vast health bureaucracy.\n“Factchecking wasn’t working very well in the first place, but now you can’t even get access to the facts that you need be able to factcheck as well as you used to,” said Millican.\nThe outlook seems bleak, but campaigners say that does not make the problems insurmountable.\nOne answer is to invest in independent, non-partisan research. A prime purpose would be to increase media literacy among young people, who primarily get news from platforms such as TikTok which can be subject to disinformation tools such as AI-manipulated videos. The aim is to teach consumers how to spot doctored footage.\n“Media literacy is extremely important and something that should be invested in and taught at a young age,” said Millican.\nAnother solution is the development of “pre-buttal” strategies to inoculate the public against disinformation, in effect getting the truth out first.\nMedia Matters for America and Common Cause used this approach during last year’s presidential election, partly by producing videos designed to counter anticipated false narratives surrounding voting procedures in certain areas.\nAlso important, said Shalini Agarwal, special counsel at Protect Democracy, is calling out the demonisation of vulnerable groups, such as immigrants, as soon as it happens.\nA crucial role is played by media, even as Trump intensifies his assault on journalists as “fake news” and tries to exclude certain established outlets from press briefings.\n“It’s really important when there are opportunities for one-on-one briefings and there are multiple reporters,” Agarwal said. “Part of it is a sense of collective action. Often, whoever is speaking at the podium won’t give a straightforward answer or gives a false answer and then tries to move on – it’s incumbent when that happens for other reporters to jump in and say: ‘Wait. What about what the other reporter asked?’”\nMillican has two pieces of advice for Britain and other European countries hoping to arm themselves against any coming authoritarian onslaught: fortify the media and preserve legislation designed to combat disinformation and illegal content online – represented by the online safety act in Britain and the digital safety act in the EU.\n“The first thing that’s going to happen in these authoritarian takeovers is they’re going to try to silence and take over the media and information landscape,” she said. “Any efforts to rein in hate speech or misinformation on platforms will be seen as tantamount to suppression of conservative thought or free speech.\n“I can’t stress enough trying to buffer the pollution of your information ecosystem as much as possible. One of the first things that they’re going to do is just take down any barriers they can.”"

    "raw_text": "Election officials should consider banning political donations made in cryptocurrency, a minister has said, amid concerns that foreign powers are using untraceable money to influence British politics.\nPat McFadden, the Cabinet Office minister and close ally of the prime minister, Keir Starmer, told MPs on Monday he thought there was a case for preventing crypto donations given how hard it was to trace their source.\nHis comments come two months after Nigel Farage announced his Reform UK party would become the first in British politics to accept donations in bitcoin, mirroring a similar move made by Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election.\nThe campaign group Spotlight on Corruption has warned this practice could allow foreign countries to undermine British democracy, saying digital currencies “may play a role in future political interference schemes”.\nMcFadden was asked by his Labour colleague Liam Byrne about banning cryptocurrency for political donations during a meeting of a joint Commons and Lords committee on the national security strategy.\n“I think it’s a very good question and I definitely think it is something that the Electoral Commission should be considering,” McFadden said. “The funding of democracy is often a controversial area but I think that it’s very important that we know who is providing the donation, are they properly registered, what are the bona fides of that donation. I think it’s a very important question you’ve asked.”\nHe added: “I always think that the legislation should keep up with the technology and practices of the time. So if you’re asking me should the legislation consider whether the current systems are fit for purpose, I think that’s a very real challenge.”\nByrne, who chairs the Commons’ business and trade committee, also urged the minister to consider tightening the rules governing donations made by people linked to “unlimited companies”, the finances of which are difficult to check.\nMcFadden replied: “We should always keep our legislation up to date to ensure that the financing of politics can be trusted by the public. And if, from time to time, the legislation needs to be changed to make sure that’s the case, then of course that’s something that should be considered.”\nMcFadden added that he believed ministers should consider putting more resources into the Electoral Commission and the National Crime Agency to help police political donations.\nByrne said afterwards: “Our party finance rules are, in truth, a Kremlin’s charter, designed for opacity, not openness.\n“If we want to clean up politics, we must root out the dark money, hidden money and foreign money. That means banning cryptocurrency donations, donations from unincorporated associations and donations financed by foreign profits. Crucially it means beefing up the National Crime Agency and Electoral Commission.”\nMcFadden’s comments come days before ministers release proposals about how to improve elections, which will lead to future legislation. That strategy paper is not expected to recommend banning cryptocurrency donations, despite his apparent support for the idea.\nSources said the paper would instead strengthen general rules regarding foreign interference, and would also apply to digital currencies.\nA government source said: “Protecting our democracy from hostile foreign interference is a central responsibility of government and that’s why we are taking action to ensure it continues to thrive for generations to come.\n“We want as many people as possible to engage in our democracy with confidence in the electoral process and our forthcoming reforms will help us do that.”\nThe paper is expected to back allowing people to vote once they are 16 and to set out measures to protect candidates standing at election from suffering abuse and harassment. On election finance, transparency campaigners said they believed the most likely area for action on election finance would be closing loopholes on foreign donations to ensure only companies making profits in the UK could give money.\nThey are concerned, however, that ministers will back away from capping individual or company donations, or giving the Electoral Commission back its powers to launch criminal investigations. They also thought the government would stop short of ordering automatic voter registration, but that there could be greater “nudge” action reminding people to register.\nMargaret Hodge, the Labour peer and anti-corruption campaigner, said there was “a lot of pressure on the government to get things right” and the House of Lords was likely to push for even stronger rules on transparency and checks on political donations.\nTom Brake, the director of Unlock Democracy campaign group and a former deputy leader of the Commons, said: “Safeguarding democracy is one of any government’s most important duties. Crypto donations, and the heightened risk of crypto being used to channel foreign money into UK politics, are a clear and present danger to democratic integrity.”\nOn the wider changes expected in the bill, he added: “Votes at 16 will only be a success if 16- and 17-year-olds are actually registered to vote. More than 6 million eligible voters in England and Wales are not currently registered to vote, with young people among the worst affected. A system of automatic voter registration would ensure no young person cannot make their voice heard.\n“Restoring the Electoral Commission’s independence is as close to a painless change as Labour could hope for. They rightly opposed the last government’s policy to interfere [by introducing a strategy and policy statement [for the Electoral Commission]. We hope they will do the right thing and reverse that change.”"

    "raw_text": "Wes Streeting has said Reform is a real threat and could replace the Conservatives as the main opposition party by the next election, as he urged the public to give Labour the “benefit of the doubt”.\nThe health secretary said Nigel Farage’s party was being treated as a “serious opposition force” after Reform’s success in the local elections, where it narrowly won a byelection from Labour and took 677 council seats, gaining control of 10 councils. Reform took most seats from the Conservatives, who lost 674, while Labour lost 187.\nSpeaking to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, Streeting said things “take time and you don’t turn around a country … in just nine months. All I’d say to people is: we’ve got the message, we’re not daft, we haven’t got our heads in the sand. All I ask people for is a bit of time and to give us the benefit of the doubt … We are going at those challenges as hard and fast as we can”.\nHe said Labour knew that people would “look for change elsewhere” if the country did not feel different by the next election and the government would “go further and faster” towards safer streets, more secure borders, waiting lists falling and the cost of living improving.\nOn Sky News, Streeting made clear that Reform was being taken seriously as an alternative challenger to the Conservatives. “I think Reform is definitely a real threat and one that we take seriously. I think there’s clearly, on the right of British politics, a realignment taking place,” he said.\n“It’s not yet clear whether at the next general election it will be Reform or the Conservatives that are Labour’s main challengers, but we’ve got to take that threat seriously. In that spirit, I think Reform does deserve more airtime and scrutiny of their policies.”\nAsked if he thought of Reform as Labour’s “most serious opposition”, he said: “I certainly do treat them as a serious opposition force.\n“I don’t know whether it will be Reform or the Conservatives that emerge as the main threat. I don’t have a horse in that race, but like Alien vs. Predator, you don’t really want either one to win but one of them will emerge as the main challenger to Labour at the next general election.”\nThe Conservatives are also under pressure after the local election results. Kemi Badenoch, the Tory leader, rejected calls from local councillors for her to resign, when asked about her performance on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\n“What we had was Labour saying ‘all we need to do is get rid of the Conservatives and everything will be better’. Things got worse,” she said. “Now we have Reform saying ‘all we need to do is get rid of the Conservatives and Labour and everything will be better’. I suspect things will get worse, but protest is in the air.”\nShe said the Conservatives still had time to turn things around before the next election: “We live in politically volatile times and what I have been saying is that we are going to take a slow and steady way. There will be bumps along [the way] but we can do this, and we will do it in four years, not 18 years, 14 years, 13 years like the previous oppositions.”\nZia Yusuf, the Reform chair, said his party would show what it could do in local government and would be publishing a plan to deport people who have entered the country by illegal means in the first term of a Reform government.\nHe also defended his party’s plans to cut diversity, equality and inclusion spending at local councils where Reform has taken control. Pressed on how much money this would save, he could not give an answer but he said Reform would bring in auditors and taskforces to cut unnecessary spending.\nThe party is now in control of 10 councils: Kent, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, North and West Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, Doncaster, Lancashire and Durham."
